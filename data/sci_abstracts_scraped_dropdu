"Abstract Background Nonmajor orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs that results in transient reduced mobility places patients at risk for venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban may be noninferior to enoxaparin with regard to the prevention of major venous thromboembolism in these patients. Methods In this international, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned adult patients undergoing lower-limb nonmajor orthopedic surgery who were considered to be at risk for venous thromboembolism on the basis of the investigator’s judgment to receive either rivaroxaban or enoxaparin. The primary efficacy outcome of major venous thromboembolism was a composite of symptomatic distal or proximal deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or venous thromboembolism–related death during the treatment period or asymptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis at the end of treatment. A test for superiority was planned if rivaroxaban proved to be noninferior to enoxaparin. For all outcomes, multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding (fatal, critical, or clinically overt bleeding or bleeding at the surgical site leading to intervention) and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding. Results A total of 3604 patients underwent randomization; 1809 patients were assigned to receive rivaroxaban, and 1795 to receive enoxaparin. Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 4 of 1661 patients (0.2%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 18 of 1640 patients (1.1%) in the enoxaparin group (risk ratio with multiple imputation, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.75; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). The incidence of bleeding did not differ significantly between the rivaroxaban group and the enoxaparin group (1.1% and 1.0%, respectively, for major bleeding or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding; 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively, for major bleeding). Conclusions Rivaroxaban was more effective than enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolic events during a period of immobilization after nonmajor orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs.

"Abstract Background Recent guidelines recommend consideration of the use of oral edoxaban or rivaroxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. However, the benefit of these oral agents is limited by the increased risk of bleeding associated with their use. Methods This was a multinational, randomized, investigator-initiated, open-label, noninferiority trial with blinded central outcome adjudication. We randomly assigned consecutive patients with cancer who had symptomatic or incidental acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily) or subcutaneous dalteparin (at a dose of 200 IU per kilogram of body weight once daily for the first month, followed by 150 IU per kilogram once daily). The treatments were administered for 6 months. The primary outcome was objectively confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism during the trial period. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding. Results Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 32 of 576 patients (5.6%) in the apixaban group and in 46 of 579 patients (7.9%) in the dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 1.07; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Major bleeding occurred in 22 patients (3.8%) in the apixaban group and in 23 patients (4.0%) in the dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.69; P=0.60). Conclusions Oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous dalteparin for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism without an increased risk of major bleeding.

"Abstract Background The roles of anticoagulation alone or with an antiplatelet agent after transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) have not been well studied. Methods We performed a randomized trial of clopidogrel in patients undergoing TAVI who were receiving oral anticoagulation for appropriate indications. Patients were assigned before TAVI in a 1:1 ratio not to receive clopidogrel or to receive clopidogrel for 3 months. The two primary outcomes were all bleeding and non–procedure-related bleeding over a period of 12 months. Procedure-related bleeding was defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 4 severe bleeding, and therefore most bleeding at the puncture site was counted as non–procedure-related. The two secondary outcomes were a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non–procedure-related bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 12 months (secondary composite 1) and a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction (secondary composite 2), both tested for noninferiority (noninferiority margin, 7.5 percentage points) and superiority. Results Bleeding occurred in 34 of the 157 patients (21.7%) receiving oral anticoagulation alone and in 54 of the 156 (34.6%) receiving oral anticoagulation plus clopidogrel (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.90; P=0.01); most bleeding events were at the TAVI access site. Non–procedure-related bleeding occurred in 34 patients (21.7%) and in 53 (34.0%), respectively (risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.92; P=0.02). Most bleeding occurred in the first month and was minor. A secondary composite 1 event occurred in 49 patients (31.2%) receiving oral anticoagulation alone and in 71 (45.5%) receiving oral anticoagulation plus clopidogrel (difference, −14.3 percentage points; 95% CI for noninferiority, −25.0 to −3.6; risk ratio, 0.69; 95% CI for superiority, 0.51 to 0.92). A secondary composite 2 event occurred in 21 patients (13.4%) and in 27 (17.3%), respectively (difference, −3.9 percentage points; 95% CI for noninferiority, −11.9 to 4.0; risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI for superiority, 0.46 to 1.31). Conclusions In patients undergoing TAVI who were receiving oral anticoagulation, the incidence of serious bleeding over a period of 1 month or 1 year was lower with oral anticoagulation alone than with oral anticoagulation plus clopidogrel.

"Abstract Background The effect of vericiguat, a novel oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who had recently been hospitalized or had received intravenous diuretic therapy is unclear. Methods In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 5050 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV) and an ejection fraction of less than 45% to receive vericiguat (target dose, 10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to guideline-based medical therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or first hospitalization for heart failure. Results Over a median of 10.8 months, a primary-outcome event occurred in 897 of 2526 patients (35.5%) in the vericiguat group and in 972 of 2524 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.98; P=0.02). A total of 691 patients (27.4%) in the vericiguat group and 747 patients (29.6%) in the placebo group were hospitalized for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.00). Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 414 patients (16.4%) in the vericiguat group and in 441 patients (17.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06). The composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 957 patients (37.9%) in the vericiguat group and in 1032 patients (40.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98; P=0.02). Symptomatic hypotension occurred in 9.1% of the patients in the vericiguat group and in 7.9% of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.12), and syncope occurred in 4.0% of the patients in the vericiguat group and in 3.5% of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.30). Conclusions Among patients with high-risk heart failure, the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure was lower among those who received vericiguat than among those who received placebo.

"Abstract Background Patients with peripheral artery disease who have undergone lower-extremity revascularization are at high risk for major adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in this context are uncertain. Methods In a double-blind trial, patients with peripheral artery disease who had undergone revascularization were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation for vascular causes, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding, defined according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) classification; major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) was a secondary safety outcome. Results A total of 6564 patients underwent randomization; 3286 were assigned to the rivaroxaban group, and 3278 were assigned to the placebo group. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 508 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 584 in the placebo group; the Kaplan–Meier estimates of the incidence at 3 years were 17.3% and 19.9%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.96; P=0.009). TIMI major bleeding occurred in 62 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 44 patients in the placebo group (2.65% and 1.87%; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.10; P=0.07). ISTH major bleeding occurred in 140 patients in the rivaroxaban group, as compared with 100 patients in the placebo group (5.94% and 4.06%; hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.84; P=0.007). Conclusions In patients with peripheral artery disease who had undergone lower-extremity revascularization, rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin was associated with a significantly lower incidence of the composite outcome of acute limb ischemia, major amputation for vascular causes, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes than aspirin alone. The incidence of TIMI major bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of ISTH major bleeding was significantly higher with rivaroxaban and aspirin than with aspirin alone.

"Abstract Background Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region. Methods After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. Results As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. Conclusions In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.

"Abstract Background The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Methods We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. Results Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Conclusions On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.) "
"Abstract Background Polymer-free drug-coated stents provide superior clinical outcomes to bare-metal stents in patients at high bleeding risk who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and are treated with 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy. Data on the use of polymer-based drug-eluting stents, as compared with polymer-free drug-coated stents, in such patients are limited. Methods In an international, randomized, single-blind trial, we compared polymer-based zotarolimus-eluting stents with polymer-free umirolimus–coated stents in patients at high bleeding risk. After PCI, patients were treated with 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy, followed by single antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was a safety composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis at 1 year. The principal secondary outcome was target-lesion failure, an effectiveness composite of death from cardiac causes, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target-lesion revascularization. Both outcomes were powered for noninferiority. Results A total of 1996 patients at high bleeding risk were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive zotarolimus-eluting stents (1003 patients) or polymer-free drug-coated stents (993 patients). At 1 year, the primary outcome was observed in 169 of 988 patients (17.1%) in the zotarolimus-eluting stent group and in 164 of 969 (16.9%) in the polymer-free drug-coated stent group (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 3.5; noninferiority margin, 4.1; P=0.01 for noninferiority). The principal secondary outcome was observed in 174 patients (17.6%) in the zotarolimus-eluting stent group and in 169 (17.4%) in the polymer-free drug-coated stent group (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5% CI, 3.5; noninferiority margin, 4.4; P=0.007 for noninferiority). Conclusions Among patients at high bleeding risk who received 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, use of polymer-based zotarolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to use of polymer-free drug-coated stents with regard to safety and effectiveness composite outcomes.

"Abstract Background Among some patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection who have undergone multiple antiretroviral therapies and have limited options for treatment, new classes of antiretroviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. Fostemsavir is the prodrug of temsavir, a first-in-class investigational HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. Methods In this ongoing phase 3 trial in 23 countries, we enrolled patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in two cohorts, according to their remaining treatment options. In the first cohort, we assigned (in a 3:1 ratio) patients who had the option of using at least one fully active, approved antiretroviral drug in at least one but no more than two antiretroviral classes to add either fostemsavir (at a dose of 600 mg twice daily) or placebo to their failing regimen for 8 days, followed by open-label fostemsavir plus optimized background therapy (randomized cohort). In the second cohort, patients who had no remaining antiretroviral options were started on open-label fostemsavir plus optimized background therapy on day 1 (nonrandomized cohort). The primary end point was the mean change in the HIV-1 RNA level from day 1 through day 8 in the randomized cohort. Results A total of 371 patients were treated, including 272 in the randomized cohort and 99 in the nonrandomized cohort. At day 8, the mean decrease in the HIV-1 RNA level was 0.79 log10 copies per milliliter in the fostemsavir group and 0.17 log10 copies in the placebo group (P<0.001). At week 48, a virologic response (HIV-1 RNA level, <40 copies per milliliter) had occurred in 54% of the patients in the randomized cohort and in 38% of those in the nonrandomized cohort; the mean increase in the CD4+ T-cell count was 139 cells per cubic millimeter and 64 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively. Adverse events led to the discontinuation of fostemsavir in 7% of the patients. In the randomized cohort, glycoprotein 120 (gp120) substitutions were found in 20 of 47 patients (43%) with virologic failure. 10 10 Conclusions In patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection with limited therapy options, those who received fostemsavir had a significantly greater decrease in the HIV-1 RNA level than those who received placebo during the first 8 days. Efficacy was sustained through 48 weeks. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and GSK/ViiV Healthcare; BRIGHTE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02362503.)

"Abstract Background Patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia need regular red-cell transfusions. Luspatercept, a recombinant fusion protein that binds to select transforming growth factor β superfamily ligands, may enhance erythroid maturation and reduce the transfusion burden (the total number of red-cell units transfused) in such patients. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, adults with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia to receive best supportive care plus luspatercept (at a dose of 1.00 to 1.25 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for at least 48 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who had a reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 33% from baseline during weeks 13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 red-cell units over this 12-week interval. Other efficacy end points included reductions in the transfusion burden during any 12-week interval and results of iron studies. Results A total of 224 patients were assigned to the luspatercept group and 112 to the placebo group. Luspatercept or placebo was administered for a median of approximately 64 weeks in both groups. The percentage of patients who had a reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 33% from baseline during weeks 13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 red-cell units over this 12-week interval was significantly greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (21.4% vs. 4.5%, P<0.001). During any 12-week interval, the percentage of patients who had a reduction in transfusion burden of at least 33% was greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (70.5% vs. 29.5%), as was the percentage of those who had a reduction of at least 50% (40.2% vs. 6.3%). The least-squares mean difference between the groups in serum ferritin levels at week 48 was −348 μg per liter (95% confidence interval, −517 to −179) in favor of luspatercept. Adverse events of transient bone pain, arthralgia, dizziness, hypertension, and hyperuricemia were more common with luspatercept than placebo. During any 12-week interval, the percentage of patients who had a reduction in transfusion burden of at least 33% was greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (70.5% vs. 29.5%), as was the percentage of those who had a reduction of at least 50% (40.2% vs. 6.3%). Conclusions The percentage of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia who had a reduction in transfusion burden was significantly greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group, and few adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment.

"Abstract Background In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, daily interruption of sedation has been shown to reduce the time on ventilation and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Data on whether a plan of no sedation, as compared with a plan of light sedation, has an effect on mortality are lacking. Methods In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, mechanically ventilated ICU patients to a plan of no sedation (nonsedation group) or to a plan of light sedation (i.e., to a level at which the patient was arousable, defined as a score of −2 to −3 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale [RASS], on which scores range from −5 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]) (sedation group) with daily interruption. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the number of major thromboembolic events, the number of days free from coma or delirium, acute kidney injury according to severity, the number of ICU-free days, and the number of ventilator-free days. Between-group differences were calculated as the value in the nonsedation group minus the value in the sedation group. Results A total of 710 patients underwent randomization, and 700 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two trial groups, except for the score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, which was 1 point higher in the nonsedation group than in the sedation group, indicating a greater chance of in-hospital death. The mean RASS score in the nonsedation group increased from −1.3 on day 1 to −0.8 on day 7 and, in the sedation group, from −2.3 on day 1 to −1.8 on day 7. Mortality at 90 days was 42.4% in the nonsedation group and 37.0% in the sedated group (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.2 to 12.2; P=0.65). The number of ICU-free days and of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the trial groups. The patients in the nonsedation group had a median of 27 days free from coma or delirium, and those in the sedation group had a median of 26 days free from coma or delirium. A major thromboembolic event occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) in the nonsedation group and in 10 patients (2.8%) in the sedation group (difference, −2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.8 to −0.7 [unadjusted for multiple comparisons]). Conclusions Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between those assigned to a plan of no sedation and those assigned to a plan of light sedation with daily interruption.

"Abstract Background Long-acting injectable regimens may simplify therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Methods We conducted a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial in which adults with HIV-1 infection who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy were given 20 weeks of daily oral induction therapy with dolutegravir–abacavir–lamivudine. Participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter after 16 weeks were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue the current oral therapy or switch to oral cabotegravir plus rilpivirine for 1 month followed by monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine. The primary end point was the percentage of participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher at week 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm). Results At week 48, an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher was found in 6 of 283 participants (2.1%) who received long-acting therapy and in 7 of 283 (2.5%) who received oral therapy (adjusted difference, −0.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.8 to 2.1), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for the primary end point (margin, 6 percentage points). An HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 was found in 93.6% who received long-acting therapy and in 93.3% who received oral therapy (adjusted difference, 0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −3.7 to 4.5), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for this end point (margin, −10 percentage points). Of the participants who received long-acting therapy, 86% reported injection-site reactions (median duration, 3 days; mild or moderate severity, 99% of cases); 4 participants withdrew from the trial for injection-related reasons. Grade 3 or higher adverse events and events that met liver-related stopping criteria occurred in 11% and 2%, respectively, who received long-acting therapy and in 4% and 1% who received oral therapy. Treatment satisfaction increased after participants switched to long-acting therapy; 91% preferred long-acting therapy at week 48. Conclusions Therapy with long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine was noninferior to oral therapy with dolutegravir–abacavir–lamivudine with regard to maintaining HIV-1 suppression. Injection-site reactions were common. (Funded by ViiV Healthcare and Janssen; FLAIR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02938520.) NCT02938520 "
"Abstract Background The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months. Methods In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4–L5 or L5–S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Results From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P<0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

"Abstract Background Simplified regimens for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may increase patient satisfaction and facilitate adherence. Methods In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial involving patients who had had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter for at least 6 months while taking standard oral antiretroviral therapy, we randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either continue their oral therapy or switch to monthly intramuscular injections of long-acting cabotegravir, an HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer inhibitor, and long-acting rilpivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. The primary end point was the percentage of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher at week 48, determined with the use of the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm. Results Treatment was initiated in 308 participants per group. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA levels of 50 copies per milliliter or higher were found in 5 participants (1.6%) receiving long-acting therapy and in 3 (1.0%) receiving oral therapy (adjusted difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.2 to 2.5), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for the primary end point (noninferiority margin, 6 percentage points). An HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 was found in 92.5% of participants receiving long-acting therapy and in 95.5% of those receiving oral therapy (adjusted difference, −3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.7 to 0.7), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for this end point (noninferiority margin, −10 percentage points). Virologic failure was confirmed in 3 participants who received long-acting therapy and 4 participants who received oral therapy. Adverse events were more common in the long-acting–therapy group and included injection-site pain, which occurred in 231 recipients (75%) of long-acting therapy and was mild or moderate in most cases; 1% withdrew because of this event. Serious adverse events were reported in no more than 5% of participants in each group. Conclusions Monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine were noninferior to standard oral therapy for maintaining HIV-1 suppression. Injection-related adverse events were common but only infrequently led to medication withdrawal. (Funded by ViiV Healthcare and Janssen; ATLAS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02951052.)

"Abstract Background No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. o 2 o 2 o 2 Results A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. Conclusions In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

"Abstract Background Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Monoclonal antibodies directed against proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by more than 50% but require administration every 2 to 4 weeks. In a phase 2 trial, a twice-yearly injection of inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, was shown to inhibit hepatic synthesis of PCSK9 in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Methods In this phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 482 adults who had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to receive subcutaneous injections of inclisiran sodium (at a dose of 300 mg) or matching placebo on days 1, 90, 270, and 450. The two primary end points were the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level on day 510 and the time-adjusted percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level between day 90 and day 540. Results The median age of the patients was 56 years, and 47% were men; the mean baseline level of LDL cholesterol was 153 mg per deciliter. At day 510, the percent change in the LDL cholesterol level was a reduction of 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], −43.7 to −35.7) in the inclisiran group and an increase of 8.2% (95% CI, 4.3 to 12.2) in the placebo group, for a between-group difference of −47.9 percentage points (95% CI, −53.5 to −42.3; P<0.001). The time-averaged percent change in the LDL cholesterol level between day 90 and day 540 was a reduction of 38.1% (95% CI, −41.1 to −35.1) in the inclisiran group and an increase of 6.2% (95% CI, 3.3 to 9.2) in the placebo group, for a between-group difference of −44.3 percentage points (95% CI, −48.5 to −40.1; P<0.001). There were robust reductions in LDL cholesterol levels in all genotypes of familial hypercholesterolemia. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. Conclusions Among adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, those who received inclisiran had significantly lower levels of LDL cholesterol than those who received placebo, with an infrequent dosing regimen and an acceptable safety profile.

"Abstract Background Inclisiran inhibits hepatic synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9. Previous studies suggest that inclisiran might provide sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with infrequent dosing. Methods We enrolled patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ORION-10 trial) and patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk equivalent (ORION-11 trial) who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inclisiran (284 mg) or placebo, administered by subcutaneous injection on day 1, day 90, and every 6 months thereafter over a period of 540 days. The coprimary end points in each trial were the placebo-corrected percentage change in LDL cholesterol level from baseline to day 510 and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL cholesterol level from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540. Results A total of 1561 and 1617 patients underwent randomization in the ORION-10 and ORION-11 trials, respectively. Mean (±SD) LDL cholesterol levels at baseline were 104.7±38.3 mg per deciliter (2.71±0.99 mmol per liter) and 105.5±39.1 mg per deciliter (2.73±1.01 mmol per liter), respectively. At day 510, inclisiran reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 52.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.8 to 55.7) in the ORION-10 trial and by 49.9% (95% CI, 46.6 to 53.1) in the ORION-11 trial, with corresponding time-adjusted reductions of 53.8% (95% CI, 51.3 to 56.2) and 49.2% (95% CI, 46.8 to 51.6) (P<0.001 for all comparisons vs. placebo). Adverse events were generally similar in the inclisiran and placebo groups in each trial, although injection-site adverse events were more frequent with inclisiran than with placebo (2.6% vs. 0.9% in the ORION-10 trial and 4.7% vs. 0.5% in the ORION-11 trial); such reactions were generally mild, and none were severe or persistent. Conclusions Reductions in LDL cholesterol levels of approximately 50% were obtained with inclisiran, administered subcutaneously every 6 months. More injection-site adverse events occurred with inclisiran than with placebo. (Funded by the Medicines Company; ORION-10 and ORION-11 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03399370 and NCT03400800.)

"Abstract Background No approved therapies exist for inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Methods We conducted an open-label, phase 2 trial of selumetinib to determine the objective response rate among patients with plexiform neurofibromas and to assess clinical benefit. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibromas received oral selumetinib twice daily at a dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (28-day cycles). Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical outcome assessments (pain, quality of life, disfigurement, and function) were performed at least every four cycles. Children rated tumor pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Results A total of 50 children (median age, 10.2 years; range, 3.5 to 17.4) were enrolled from August 2015 through August 2016. The most frequent neurofibroma-related symptoms were disfigurement (44 patients), motor dysfunction (33), and pain (26). A total of 35 patients (70%) had a confirmed partial response as of March 29, 2019, and 28 of these patients had a durable response (lasting ≥1 year). After 1 year of treatment, the mean decrease in child-reported tumor pain-intensity scores was 2 points, considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In addition, clinically meaningful improvements were seen in child-reported and parent-reported interference of pain in daily functioning (38% and 50%, respectively) and overall health-related quality of life (48% and 58%, respectively) as well as in functional outcomes of strength (56% of patients) and range of motion (38% of patients). Five patients discontinued treatment because of toxic effects possibly related to selumetinib, and 6 patients had disease progression. The most frequent toxic effects were nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; an asymptomatic increase in the creatine phosphokinase level; acneiform rash; and paronychia. Conclusions In this phase 2 trial, most children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas had durable tumor shrinkage and clinical benefit from selumetinib.

"Abstract Background Patients who are undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) often receive a high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) and have a high arterial oxygen tension. The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure, diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury, and thereby increase the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free from mechanical ventilation). io 2 Methods We randomly assigned 1000 adult patients who were anticipated to require mechanical ventilation beyond the day after recruitment in the ICU to receive conservative or usual oxygen therapy. In the two groups, the default lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) was 90%. In the conservative-oxygen group, the upper limit of the Spo2 alarm was set to sound when the level reached 97%, and the Fio2 was decreased to 0.21 if the Spo2 was above the acceptable lower limit. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the Fio2 or the Spo2. The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days from randomization until day 28. o 2 o 2 io 2 o 2 io 2 o 2 Results The number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the conservative-oxygen group and the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2), respectively, for an absolute difference of −0.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], −2.1 to 1.6; P=0.80). The conservative-oxygen group spent more time in the ICU with an Fio2 of 0.21 than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95% CI, 22 to 34); the conservative-oxygen group spent less time with an Spo2 exceeding 96%, with a duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95% CI, 14 to 30). At 180 days, mortality was 35.7% in the conservative-oxygen group and 34.5% in the usual-oxygen group, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.37). io 2 o 2 Conclusions In adults undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU, the use of conservative oxygen therapy, as compared with usual oxygen therapy, did not significantly affect the number of ventilator-free days.

"Abstract Background More information is needed about the long-term effects of low-dose aspirin (≤160 mg) on incident hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and gastrointestinal bleeding in persons with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. Methods Using nationwide Swedish registries, we identified all adults who received a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C from 2005 through 2015 and who did not have a history of aspirin use (50,275 patients). Patients who were starting to take low-dose aspirin (14,205 patients) were identified by their first filled prescriptions for 90 or more consecutive doses of aspirin. We constructed a propensity score and applied inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance baseline characteristics between groups. Using Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, we estimated the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality, accounting for competing events. Results With a median of 7.9 years of follow-up, the estimated cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was 4.0% among aspirin users and 8.3% among nonusers of aspirin (difference, −4.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −5.0 to −3.6; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.76). This inverse association appeared to be duration-dependent; as compared with short-term use (3 months to <1 year), the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.06) for 1 to less than 3 years of use, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78) for 3 to less than 5 years of use, and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.70) for 5 or more years of use. Ten-year liver-related mortality was 11.0% among aspirin users and 17.9% among nonusers (difference, −6.9 percentage points [95% CI, −8.1 to −5.7]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81]). However, the 10-year risk of gastrointestinal bleeding did not differ significantly between users and nonusers of aspirin (7.8% and 6.9%, respectively; difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.6 to 2.4). Conclusions In a nationwide study of patients with chronic viral hepatitis in Sweden, use of low-dose aspirin was associated with a significantly lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and lower liver-related mortality than no use of aspirin, without a significantly higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

"The search for early biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been central to the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia research community in recent years. To identify MCI status at the earliest possible point, recent studies have shown that linguistic markers such as word choice, utterance and sentence structures can potentially serve as preclinical behavioral markers. Here we present an adaptive dialogue algorithm (an AI-enabled dialogue agent) to identify sequences of questions (a dialogue policy) that distinguish MCI from normal (NL) cognitive status. Our AI agent adapts its questioning strategy based on the user’s previous responses to reach an individualized conversational strategy per user. Because the AI agent is adaptive and scales favorably with additional data, our method provides a potential avenue for large-scale preclinical screening of neurocognitive decline as a new digital biomarker, as well as longitudinal tracking of aging patterns in the outpatient setting."
"In men, the incidence of melanoma rises rapidly after age 50, and nearly two thirds of melanoma deaths are male. The immune system is known to play a key role in controlling the growth and spread of malignancies, but whether age- and sex-dependent changes in immune cell function account for this effect remains unknown. Here, we show that in castrated male mice, neutrophil maturation and function are impaired, leading to elevated metastatic burden in two models of melanoma. Replacement of testosterone effectively normalized the tumor burden in castrated male mice. Further, the aberrant neutrophil phenotype was also observed in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy, highlighting the evolutionary conservation and clinical relevance of the phenotype. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the role of androgen signaling in neutrophil function and the impact of this biology on immune control of malignancies."
"X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of heritable hypophosphatemic rickets. We encountered a 4-year-old boy with a novel variant in the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase homolog X-linked (PHEX) gene who presented with a short stature, genu valgum, and scaphocephaly. The same mutation was identified in his mother and sister; however, the patient presented with a more severe case."
"Background/objectivesMaternal diet is critical to fetal development. This study aimed to explore the association between maternal dietary diversity during pregnancy and congenital heart defects (CHD) in Chinese population.MethodsA hospital-based case-control study was conducted including 474 cases and 948 controls in Northwest China. We recruited eligible women waiting for delivery in the hospital and gathered their diets during the whole pregnancy by a validated food frequency questionnaire. According to the FAO Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) guideline, the participants were categorized into “inadequate dietary diversity score (DDS)” (DDS < 5) and “adequate DDS” (DDS ≥ 5) groups. The association between dietary diversity and CHD was estimated using the mixed logistic regression models.ResultsCase mothers had a lower DDS during pregnancy than the controls (P < 0.001). The proportions of women consuming all the ten defined food groups were lower in the inadequate DDS group than in the adequate DDS group among both cases and controls (all P < 0.001). The prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake was higher in the inadequate DDS group than in the adequate DDS group among both cases and controls (all P < 0.05). Women in the adequate DDS group had reduced risks of having fetuses with total CHD (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.45–0.84) and ventricular septal defects (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.38–0.88).ConclusionsAdequate DDS during pregnancy might be associated with a lower risk of CHD in offspring. Efforts to promote dietary diversity during pregnancy need to be strengthened to reduce the prevalence of CHD in Chinese population."
"Intradialytic cycling is a widely used workout mode, whereas added benefit of other exercise modalities remains unknown. This is the first randomised controlled trial on the effects and sustainability of functional training and counselling in addition to intradialytic cycling. Patients were randomly assigned to a kinesiologist-guided functional training in addition to intradialytic cycling (n = 20, experimental group) or intradialytic cycling only (n = 20, control group) over 16 weeks. The experimental group attended predialysis functional exercise in the first eight weeks and afterward performed functional training at home for the next eight weeks. The primary study endpoint was 10-repetition-sit-to-stand test time at eight weeks: at this test, the experimental group improved significantly better than controls (−4.5 ± 1.9 s, 95%CI −8.4 to −0.7; P = 0.021), which was maintained at week 16 (−4.7 ± 2.1 s, 95%CI −9.0 to −0.3; P = 0.037). At week 8, the experimental group significantly outperformed controls also at handgrip strength (P = 0.004), lower body flexibility test (P < 0.001), balance test (P < 0.001), and upper body flexibility test (P = 0.003). At week 16, superior results of the experimental group in secondary end-points remained preserved for handgrip strength, balance, and upper body flexibility tests. Functional training with exercise counselling meaningfully improves physical performance and successfully prepares patients for sustainable home exercise."
"The practicability of deep learning techniques has been demonstrated by their successful implementation in varied fields, including diagnostic imaging for clinicians. In accordance with the increasing demands in the healthcare industry, techniques for automatic prediction and detection are being widely researched. Particularly in dentistry, for various reasons, automated mandibular canal detection has become highly desirable. The positioning of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), which is one of the major structures in the mandible, is crucial to prevent nerve injury during surgical procedures. However, automatic segmentation using Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) poses certain difficulties, such as the complex appearance of the human skull, limited number of datasets, unclear edges, and noisy images. Using work-in-progress automation software, experiments were conducted with models based on 2D SegNet, 2D and 3D U-Nets as preliminary research for a dental segmentation automation tool. The 2D U-Net with adjacent images demonstrates higher global accuracy of 0.82 than naïve U-Net variants. The 2D SegNet showed the second highest global accuracy of 0.96, and the 3D U-Net showed the best global accuracy of 0.99. The automated canal detection system through deep learning will contribute significantly to efficient treatment planning and to reducing patients’ discomfort by a dentist. This study will be a preliminary report and an opportunity to explore the application of deep learning to other dental fields."
"Scaffold proteins are responsible for structural organisation within cells; they form complexes with other proteins to facilitate signalling pathways and catalytic reactions. The scaffold protein connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (CNK2) is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and was recently implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (ID). We have investigated the role of CNK2 in neurons in order to contribute to our understanding of how CNK2 alterations might cause developmental defects, and we have elucidated a functional role for CNK2 in the molecular processes that govern morphology of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We have also identified novel CNK2 interaction partners and explored their functional interdependency with CNK2. We focussed on the novel interaction partner TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase TNIK, which is also associated with ID. Both CNK2 and TNIK are expressed in neuronal dendrites and concentrated in dendritic spines, and staining with synaptic markers indicates a clear postsynaptic localisation. Importantly, our data highlight that CNK2 plays a role in directing TNIK subcellular localisation, and in neurons, CNK2 participates in ensuring that this multifunctional kinase is present in the correct place at desirable levels. In summary, our data indicate that CNK2 expression is critical for modulating PSD morphology; moreover, our study highlights that CNK2 functions as a scaffold with the potential to direct the localisation of regulatory proteins within the cell. Importantly, we describe a novel link between CNK2 and the regulatory kinase TNIK, and provide evidence supporting the idea that alterations in CNK2 localisation and expression have the potential to influence the behaviour of TNIK and other important regulatory molecules in neurons."
"Although inflammation is a host defense mechanism, chronic inflammation mediates several diseases, including cancer, allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases, and reportedly, it is associated with a 60% mortality rate. There are several reports on the anti-inflammatory effects of Curcuma longa and Allium hookeri. However, although they can be used as culinary materials and have biological effects, they are not effective anti-inflammatory agents. In this study, we evaluated the synergic effect of C. longa and A. hookeri in order to confirm the possibility of a new anti-inflammatory agent. Based on cell viability and cytokine analyses, the appropriate ratio of C. longa and A. hookeri was confirmed using an air pouch animal model. Then, the anti-inflammatory effect of C. longa and A. hookeri co-treatment was evaluated by measuring the immune cell count and cytokines in the exudate and by comparing the morphological changes and cytokines in inflamed skin samples. Additionally, we evaluated the NF-κB/COX-2 pathway and iNOS levels. The active constituents detected in C. longa were demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and that detected in A. hookeri was methylsulfonylmethane. An in vitro assessment determined the appropriate drug ratio as 3:7. In a carrageenan-induced inflammatory model, co-treatment effectively suppressed inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-17, and recovered inflammation-related morphological changes in the skin. The anti-inflammatory effect of the co-treatment was mediated through the NF-κB/COX-2 pathway and iNOS inhibition. We concluded that co-treatment with C. longa and A. hookeri synergistically inhibited inflammation via the NF-κB/COX-2/iNOS pathway."
"In males, defective reproductive traits induced by an exposure to an endocrine disruptor are transmitted to future generations via epigenetic modification of the germ cells. Interestingly, the impacted future generations display a wide range of heterogeneity in their reproductive traits. In this study, the role that the Y chromosome plays in creating such heterogeneity is explored by testing the hypothesis that the Y chromosome serves as a carrier of the exposure impact to future generations. This hypothesis implies that a male who has a Y chromosome that is from a male that was exposed to an endocrine disruptor will display a more severe reproductive phenotype than a male whose Y chromosome is from an unexposed male. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model in which F1 generation animals were exposed prenatally to an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the severity of impacted reproductive traits was compared between the F3 generation males that were descendants of F1 males (paternal lineage) and those from F1 females (maternal lineage). Pregnant dams (F0 generation) were exposed to the vehicle or 20 or 200 μg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 11 until birth. Paternal lineage F3 DEHP males exhibited decreased fertility, testicular steroidogenic capacity, and spermatogenesis that were more severely impaired than those of maternal lineage males. Indeed, testicular transcriptome analysis found that a number of Y chromosomal genes had altered expression patterns in the paternal lineage males. This transgenerational difference in the DEHP impact can be attributed specifically to the Y chromosome."
"Different evidence has indicated metabolic rewiring as a necessity for pancreatic cancer (PC) growth, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance. A relevant role has been assigned to glucose metabolism. In particular, an enhanced flux through the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) has been tightly linked to PC development. Here, we show that enhancement of the HBP, through the upregulation of the enzyme Phosphoacetylglucosamine Mutase 3 (PGM3), is associated with the onset of gemcitabine (GEM) resistance in PC. Indeed, mRNA profiles of GEM sensitive and resistant patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) indicate that PGM3 expression is specifically increased in GEM-resistant PDXs. Of note, PGM3 results also overexpressed in human PC tissues as compared to paired adjacent normal tissues and its higher expression in PC patients is associated with worse median overall survival (OS). Strikingly, genetic or pharmacological PGM3 inhibition reduces PC cell growth, migration, invasion, in vivo tumor growth and enhances GEM sensitivity. Thus, combined treatment between a specific inhibitor of PGM3, named FR054, and GEM results in a potent reduction of xenograft tumor growth without any obvious side effects in normal tissues. Mechanistically, PGM3 inhibition, reducing protein glycosylation, causes a sustained Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a significant attenuation of the pro-tumorigenic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Akt axis, and finally cell death. In conclusion this study identifies the HBP as a metabolic pathway involved in GEM resistance and provides a strong rationale for a PC therapy addressing the combined treatment with the PGM3 inhibitor and GEM."
"Cardiorespiratory monitoring is crucial for the diagnosis and management of multiple conditions such as stress and sleep disorders. Therefore, the development of ambulatory systems providing continuous, comfortable, and inexpensive means for monitoring represents an important research topic. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to derive respiratory information from the ECG signal. Ten methods to compute single-lead ECG-derived respiration (EDR) were compared under multiple conditions, including different recording systems, baseline wander, normal and abnormal breathing patterns, changes in breathing rate, noise, and artifacts. Respiratory rates, wave morphology, and cardiorespiratory information were derived from the ECG and compared to those extracted from a reference respiratory signal. Three datasets were considered for analysis, involving a total 59 482 one-min, single-lead ECG segments recorded from 156 subjects. The results indicate that the methods based on QRS slopes outperform the other methods. This result is particularly interesting since simplicity is crucial for the development of ECG-based ambulatory systems."
"The specific metabolic contribution of consuming different energy-yielding macronutrients (namely, carbohydrates, protein and lipids) to obesity is a matter of active debate. In this Review, we summarize the current research concerning associations between the intake of different macronutrients and weight gain and adiposity. We discuss insights into possible differential mechanistic pathways where macronutrients might act on either appetite or adipogenesis to cause weight gain. We also explore the role of dietary macronutrient distribution on thermogenesis or energy expenditure for weight loss and maintenance. On the basis of the data discussed, we describe a novel way to manage excessive body weight; namely, prescribing personalized diets with different macronutrient compositions according to the individual’s genotype and/or enterotype. In this context, the interplay of macronutrient consumption with obesity incidence involves mechanisms that affect appetite, thermogenesis and metabolism, and the outcomes of these mechanisms are altered by an individual’s genotype and microbiota. Indeed, the interactions of the genetic make-up and/or microbiota features of a person with specific macronutrient intakes or dietary pattern consumption help to explain individualized responses to macronutrients and food patterns, which might represent key factors for comprehensive precision nutrition recommendations and personalized obesity management."
"Although Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction in various forms of kidney injury is protective, its role in age-related renal pathology is unknown. In the ageing kidney there is nephron loss and lesions of focal glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolosclerosis. Underlying mechanisms include podocyte (visceral glomerular epithelial cell/GEC) injury. To assess whether HO-1 can attenuate ageing – related lesions, rats with GEC-targeted HO-1 overexpression (GECHO-1 rats) were generated using a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system and extent of lesions over a 12-month period were assessed and compared to those in age-matched wild-type (WT) controls. GECHO-1 rats older than 6 months developed albuminuria that was detectable at 6 months and became significantly higher compared to age-matched WT controls at 12 months. In GECHO-1 rats, lesions of focal segmental and global glomerulosclerosis as well as tubulointerstitial lesions were prominent while podocytes were edematous with areas of foot process effacement and glomerular basement membrane thickening and wrinkling. GECHO-1 rats also developed hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria associated with marked tubular hemosiderin deposition and HO-1 induction, while there was depletion of splenic iron stores. Kidney injury was of sufficient magnitude to increase serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and was oxidative in nature as shown by increased expression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdg, a byproduct of oxidative DNA damage) in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells. These observations highlight a detrimental effect of podocyte-targeted HO-1 overexpression on ageing-related renal pathology and point to increased renal iron deposition as a putative underlying mechanism."
"Adenoviral vectors are being developed as vaccines against infectious agents and tumour-associated antigens, because of their ability to induce cellular immunity. However, the protection afforded in animal models has not easily translated into primates and clinical trials, underlying the need for improving adenoviral vaccines-induced immunogenicity. A Toll-like receptor signalling molecule, TRAM, was assessed for its ability to modify the immune responses induced by an adenovirus-based vaccine. Different adenovirus vectors either expressing TRAM alone or co-expressing TRAM along with a model antigen were constructed. The modification of T-cell and antibody responses induced by TRAM was assessed in vivo in mice and in primates. Co-expression of TRAM and an antigen from adenoviruses increased the transgene-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice. Similar effects were seen when a TRAM expressing virus was co-administered with the antigen-expressing adenovirus. However, in primate studies, co-administration of a TRAM expressing adenovirus with a vaccine expressing the ME-TRAP malaria antigen had no significant effect on the immune responses. While these results support the idea that modification of innate immune signalling by genetic vectors modifies immunogenicity, they also emphasise the difficulty in generalising results from rodents into primates, where the regulatory pathway may be different to that in mice."
"Successful treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with improvements in quality of life; however, treatment utilisation is sub-optimal. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the rates of ED treatment utilisation and the barriers and enablers men experience when using treatment. We searched: MEDLINE®, Embase, the Cochrane library; AMED; HMIC; HTA; CINAHL; PsychARTICLES; PsychINFO up to August 2018. Data on rates of treatment utilisation and barriers and enablers of utilisation were extracted and summarised. Fifty studies were included. Discontinuation rates ranged from 4.4 to 76% for phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, 18.6 to 79.9% for intracavernosal injections, and 32 to 69.2% for urethral suppositories. In relation to those with a penile prosthesis, 30% discontinued having sex due to, e.g. device complications, lack of partner or a loss of sexual interest. Most research included in the current review examined barriers to treatment utilisation and therefore focussed on reasons for discontinuing treatment. However, a small number explored factors that men found helpful with regards to treatment utilisation. The most prevalent barriers to utilisation were treatment ineffectiveness, side effects, the quality of men’s intimate relationships and treatment costs. With regards to treatment enablers, the most salient finding was that men who reported side effects to a healthcare professionals (HCPs) were significantly less likely to discontinue treatment. There were limitations in methodology in that the studies did not use validated measures of treatment utilisation or barriers and enablers and no study used psychological theory to inform the examination of factors that influenced treatment utilisation. This review identifies a number of influential factors relating to ED treatment utilisation and highlights the importance of men’s beliefs with regards to ED and its treatment. Beliefs are potentially modifiable and therefore the findings of this review highlight important considerations for HCPs with regards to supporting men to make better use of treatment."
"Formation of polymorphic amyloid fibrils is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation. In Alzheimer’s disease, different fibril structures may be associated with different clinical sub-types. Structural basis of fibril polymorphism is thus important for understanding the role of amyloid fibrils in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases. Here we studied two types of Aβ42 fibrils prepared under quiescent and agitated conditions. Quiescent Aβ42 fibrils adopt a long and twisted morphology, while agitated fibrils are short and straight, forming large bundles via lateral association. EPR studies of these two types of Aβ42 fibrils show that the secondary structure is similar in both fibril polymorphs. At the same time, agitated Aβ42 fibrils show stronger interactions between spin labels across the full range of the Aβ42 sequence, suggesting a more tightly packed structure. Our data suggest that cross-strand side chain packing interactions within the same β-sheet may play a critical role in the formation of polymorphic fibrils."
"Histological and molecular analyses of urothelial carcinoma often reveal intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity at the genomic, transcriptional and cellular levels. Despite the clonal initiation of the tumour, progression and metastasis often arise from subclones that can develop naturally or during therapy, resulting in molecular alterations with a heterogeneous distribution. Variant histologies in tumour tissues that have developed distinct morphological characteristics divergent from urothelial carcinoma are extreme examples of tumour heterogeneity. Ultimately, heterogeneity contributes to drug resistance and relapse after therapy, resulting in poor survival outcomes. Mutation profile differences between patients with muscle-invasive and metastatic urothelial cancer (interpatient heterogeneity) probably contribute to variability in response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy as first-line treatments. Heterogeneity can occur on multiple levels and averaging or normalizing these alterations is crucial for clinical trial and drug design to enable appropriate therapeutic targeting. Identification of the extent of heterogeneity might shape the choice of monotherapy or additional combination treatments to target different drivers and genetic events. Identification of the lethal tumour cell clones is required to improve survival of patients with urothelial carcinoma."
"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with infection by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). PEL is an aggressive disease with extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Narciclasine, a natural product present in Amaryllidaceae family of flowering plants including daffodils, belongs to a class of molecules termed ‘isocarbostyril alkaloid’. We have found that narciclasine displays preferential cytotoxicity towards PEL at low nanomolar concentrations and is approximately 10 and 100-fold more potent than its structural analogs lycoricidine and lycorine, respectively. Narciclasine arrested cell-cycle progression at the G1 phase and induced apoptosis in PEL, which is accompanied by activation of caspase-3/7, cleavage of PARP and increase in the surface expression of Annexin-V. Although narciclasine treatment resulted in a marked decrease in the expression of MYC and its direct target genes,time-course experiments revealed that MYC is not a direct target of narciclasine. Narciclasine treatment neither induces the expression of KSHV-RTA/ORF50 nor the production of infectious KSHV virions in PEL. Finally, narciclasine provides dramatic survival advantages to mice in two distinct mouse xenograft models of PEL. In conclusion, our results suggest that narciclasine could be a promising agent for the treatment of PEL."
"Induction of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) that bind to the viral envelope glycoproteins is a major goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine research. The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains."
"Tumours reprogram host physiology, metabolism and immune responses during cancer progression. The release of soluble factors, exosomes and metabolites from tumours leads to systemic changes in distant organs, where cancer cells metastasize and grow. These tumour-derived circulating factors also profoundly impact tissues that are rarely inhabited by metastatic cancer cells such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In fact, the majority of patients with metastatic cancer develop a debilitating muscle-wasting syndrome, known as cachexia, that is associated with decreased tolerance to antineoplastic therapy, poor prognosis and accelerated death, with no approved treatments. In this Perspective, we discuss the development of cachexia in the context of metastatic progression. We briefly discuss how circulating factors either directly or indirectly promote cachexia development and examine how signals from the metastatic process can trigger and amplify this process. Finally, we highlight promising therapeutic opportunities for targeting cachexia in the context of metastatic cancers."
"BackgroundAdjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care in high-risk early breast cancer patients. Dose-dense should be the preferred schedule of administration. However, its long-term benefit is unknown.MethodsIn the Italian multicentre Phase 3 randomised MIG-1 trial, node-positive and high-risk node- negative breast cancer patients were randomised to receive six cycles of adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide regimen administered every 3 (FEC21) or 2 (FEC14) weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS).ResultsFrom 1992 to 1997, 1214 patients were included. Median follow-up was 15.8 years. In all, 15-year OS was 71% and 68% in the FEC14 and FEC21 groups, respectively (HR = 0.89; p = 0.25). In all, 15-year EFS was 47% and 43% in the FEC14 and FEC21 groups, respectively (HR = 0.87; p = 0.18). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis, among patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours, 15-year OS was 70% and 65% in the FEC14 and FEC21 groups, respectively (HR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.51–1.06); 15-year EFS was 58% and 43% in the FEC14 and FEC21 groups, respectively (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51–0.96).ConclusionsUpdated results from the MIG-1 study are numerically in favour of dose-dense chemotherapy, and suggest a long-term benefit of this approach in high-risk early breast cancer patients."
"The study describes a relationship between the 3′UTR variants, clinicopathological parameters and response to chemotherapy. We analyzed 33 germline polymorphisms in 3′UTRs of ADME genes in 305 breast cancer women treated with FAC regime. Clinical endpoints of this study were: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall response defined as treatment failure-free survival (TFFS). The shortened OS was connected with the presence of NR1/2 rs3732359 AA, SLC22A16 rs7756222 CC, as well as SLC22A16 rs9487402 allele G and clinical factors belonging to TNM classification: tumor size >1 cm, nodal involvement and presence of metastases. PFS was related to two polymorphisms PGR rs1824125 GG, PGR rs12224560 CC and SLC22A16 rs7756222 CC as well as preexisting metastases. The RFS was shortened due to the DPYD rs291593 CC, AKR1C3 rs3209896 AG and negative expression of PGR. The presence of ALDH5A1 rs1054899 allele A, lack of pre-chemotherapy surgery and negative status of PGR correlated with worse treatment response. The germline variants commonly present in the population are important factors determining the response to treatment. We observed the effect of the accumulation of genetic and clinical factors on poor survival prognosis and overall treatment response."
"Two laxaphycin type-B cyclic dodecapeptides, laxaphycins B5 and B6, were obtained from UIC 10484, a freshwater cf. Phormidium sp. Analysis using the 16S rRNA sequence found UIC 10484 to clade with UIC 10045, a known laxaphycin type-A and -B producer, and MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of two novel laxaphycin type-B compounds. The structures of the metabolites were elucidated using 2D NMR and MS/MS. The absolute configurations of the amino acids were determined by advanced Marfey’s analysis. Both metabolites were evaluated against the same three cancer cell lines. The IC50 of both laxaphycins B5 and B6 was near 1 μM against breast cancer MDA-MB-231, melanoma MDA-MB-435, and ovarian cancer OVCAR3 cell lines."
"Cancer stemness, referring to the stem-cell-like phenotype of cancer cells, has been recognised to play important roles in different aspects of hepatocarcinogenesis. A number of well-established cell-surface markers already exist for liver cancer stem cells, with potential new markers of liver cancer stem cells being identified. Both genetic and epigenetic factors that affect various signalling pathways are known to contribute to cancer stemness. In addition, the tumour microenvironment—both physical and cellular—is known to play an important role in regulating cancer stemness, and the potential interaction between cancer stem cells and their microenvironment has provided insight into the regulation of the tumour-initiating ability as well as the cellular plasticity of liver CSCs. Potential specific therapeutic targeting of liver cancer stemness is also discussed. With increased knowledge, effective druggable targets might be identified, with the aim of improving treatment outcome by reducing chemoresistance."
"The renal angina index has been proposed to identify patients at high risk of persistent AKI, based on slight changes in serum creatinine and patient conditions. However, a concise scoring method has only been proposed for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients yet. Here, we developed and validated a concise scoring method using data on patients admitted to ICUs in 21 Japanese hospitals from 2012 to 2014. We randomly assigned to either discovery or validation cohorts, identified the factors significantly associated with persistent AKI using a multivariable logistic regression model in the discovery cohort to establish a scoring system, and assessed the validity of the scoring in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the calibration slope. Among 8,320 patients admitted to the ICUs, persistent AKI was present in 1,064 (12.8%) patients. In the discovery cohort (n = 4,151), ‘hyperbilirubinemia’, ‘sepsis’ and ‘ventilator and/or vasoactive’ with small changes in serum creatinine were selected to establish the scoring. In the validation cohort (n = 4,169), the predicting model based on this scoring had a c-statistic of 0.79 (95%CI, 0.77–0.81) and was well calibrated. In conclusion, we established a concise scoring method to identify potential patients with persistent AKI, which performed well in the validation cohort."
"The aim of this study was to develop a fetal cartilage-derived progenitor cell (FCPC) based cartilage gel through self-assembly for cartilage repair surgery, with clinically useful properties including adhesiveness, plasticity, and continued chondrogenic remodeling after transplantation. Characterization of the gels according to in vitro self-assembly period resulted in increased chondrogenic features over time. Adhesion strength of the cartilage gels were significantly higher compared to alginate gel, with the 2-wk group showing a near 20-fold higher strength (1.8 ± 0.15 kPa vs. 0.09 ± 0.01 kPa, p < 0.001). The in vivo remodeling process analysis of the 2 wk cultured gels showed increased cartilage repair characteristics and stiffness over time, with higher integration-failure stress compared to osteochondral autograft controls at 4 weeks (p < 0.01). In the nonhuman primate investigation, cartilage repair scores were significantly better in the gel group compared to defects alone after 24 weeks (p < 0.001). Cell distribution analysis at 24 weeks showed that human cells remained within the transplanted defects only. A self-assembled, FCPC-based cartilage gel showed chondrogenic repair potential as well as adhesive properties, beneficial for cartilage repair."
"Evidence is mounting that the gut-brain axis plays an important role in mental diseases fueling mechanistic investigations to provide a basis for future targeted interventions. However, shotgun metagenomic data from treatment-naïve patients are scarce hampering comprehensive analyses of the complex interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain. Here we explore the fecal microbiome based on 90 medication-free schizophrenia patients and 81 controls and identify a microbial species classifier distinguishing patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896, and replicate the microbiome-based disease classifier in 45 patients and 45 controls (AUC = 0.765). Functional potentials associated with schizophrenia include differences in short-chain fatty acids synthesis, tryptophan metabolism, and synthesis/degradation of neurotransmitters. Transplantation of a schizophrenia-enriched bacterium, Streptococcus vestibularis, appear to induces deficits in social behaviors, and alters neurotransmitter levels in peripheral tissues in recipient mice. Our findings provide new leads for further investigations in cohort studies and animal models."
"The genetically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) continues to be an intractable disease, due to lack of effective targeted therapies. Gene amplification is a major event in tumorigenesis. Genes with amplification-dependent expression are being explored as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study, we have applied Analytical Multi-scale Identification of Recurring Events analysis and transcript quantification in the TNBC genome across 222 TNBC tumors and identified 138 candidate genes with positive correlation in copy number gain (CNG) and gene expression. siRNA-based loss-of-function screen of the candidate genes has validated EGFR, MYC, ASAP1, IRF2BP2, and CCT5 genes as drivers promoting proliferation in different TNBC cells. MYC, ASAP1, IRF2BP2, and CCT5 display frequent CNG and concurrent expression over 2173 breast cancer tumors (cBioPortal dataset). More frequently are MYC and ASAP1 amplified in TNBC tumors (>30%, n = 320). In particular, high expression of ASAP1, the ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein, is significantly related to poor metastatic relapse-free survival of TNBC patients (n = 257, bc-GenExMiner). Furthermore, we have revealed that silencing of ASAP1 modulates numerous cytokine and apoptosis signaling components, such as IL1B, TRAF1, AIFM2, and MAP3K11 that are clinically relevant to survival outcomes of TNBC patients. ASAP1 has been reported to promote invasion and metastasis in various cancer cells. Our findings that ASAP1 is an amplification-dependent TNBC driver gene promoting TNBC cell proliferation, functioning upstream apoptosis components, and correlating to clinical outcomes of TNBC patients, support ASAP1 as a potential actionable target for TNBC treatment."
"We report a 7-year-old boy with infantile spasms caused by a novel mutation in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene. He showed infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalogram from early infancy. Brain MRI did not reveal severe malformation of the brain except mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Two-fold adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy failed to control the seizures, and ketogenic diet therapy and multi-antiepileptic drug therapy were required as he showed intractable daily tonic-clonic seizures. Exome sequencing identified a hemizygous mutation in the ARX gene, NG_008281.1(ARX_v001):c.1448 + 1 G > A, chrX: 25025227 C > T (GRCh37). To our knowledge, this mutation has not been reported previously."
"Cognitive impairment is an increasingly recognized major cause of chronic disability and is commonly found in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Knowledge of the relationship between kidney dysfunction and impaired cognition may improve our understanding of other forms of cognitive dysfunction. Patients with CKD are at an increased risk (compared with the general population) of both dementia and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which are characterized by deficits in executive functions, memory and attention. Brain imaging in patients with CKD has revealed damage to white matter in the prefrontal cortex and, in animal models, in the subcortical monoaminergic and cholinergic systems, accompanied by widespread macrovascular and microvascular damage. Unfortunately, current interventions that target cardiovascular risk factors (such as anti-hypertensive drugs, anti-platelet agents and statins) seem to have little or no effect on CKD-associated MCI, suggesting that the accumulation of uraemic neurotoxins may be more important than disturbed haemodynamic factors or lipid metabolism in MCI pathogenesis. Experimental models show that the brain monoaminergic system is susceptible to uraemic neurotoxins and that this system is responsible for the altered sleep pattern commonly observed in patients with CKD. Neural progenitor cells and the glymphatic system, which are important in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, may also be involved in CKD-associated MCI. More detailed study of CKD-associated MCI is needed to fully understand its clinical relevance, underlying pathophysiology, possible means of early diagnosis and prevention, and whether there may be novel approaches and potential therapies with wider application to this and other forms of cognitive decline."
"BackgroundNutritional knowledge assessment is an important component in nutrition research, and a prerequisite for the implementation of many policies and programs aimed at improving eating behavior. In order to generate objective results, validated tools for a given population must be employed. The aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of a nutrition knowledge questionnaire for Romanian adults.MethodsKleimann’s version of a General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire, was translated and adapted to Romanian language, culture, and cuisine. The final format was developed in several steps and used four components: internal and external reliability were assessed in a general population sample (n1 = 412), respectively in a subgroup (n2 = 46) from Component 1; Component 3 assessed construct validity (n3 = 96) using the “known-groups” method; Component 4 (convergent validity, n4 = 508) tested the association between socio-demographic characteristics and nutrition knowledge.ResultsThe overall internal reliability was 0.878 and the external reliability was >0.880 in all sections, and overall. Specialists had higher scores than nonspecialists, with a very large effect size. In the general population, females scored higher than males, and middle-aged and older adults scored higher than young adults. Higher scores were associated with higher levels of education. The characteristics of individuals prone to giving wrong answers were: males (beta = 0.170), high school or less (beta = 0.167), and no training in nutrition (beta = 0.154).ConclusionsThe Romanian version of the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool for measuring nutrition knowledge in adults."
"Potassium depletion affects AQP2 expression and the cellular composition of the kidney collecting duct. This, in turn, contributes to the development of a secondary form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypokalemic nephropathy. Here we show that after 14 days of potassium depletion, the cellular fraction of A-type intercalated cells increases while the fraction of principal cells decreases along the outer medullary collecting duct in rats. The intercalated cells acquired a novel distribution pattern forming rows of cells attached to each other. These morphological changes occur progressively and reverse after 7 days of recovery on normal rat chow diet. The cellular remodeling mainly occurred in the inner stripe of outer medulla similar to the previously seen effect of lithium on the collecting duct cellular profile. The cellular remodeling is associated with the appearance of cells double labelled with both specific markers of principal and type-A intercalated cells. The appearance of this cell type was associated with the downregulation of the Notch signaling via the Hes1 pathways. These results show that the epithelium of the collecting duct has a high degree of plasticity and that Notch signaling likely plays a key role during hypokalemia."
"Copper ions play various roles in mammalian cells, presumably due to their involvement in different enzymatic reactions. Some studies indicated that serum copper correlates with fibrosis in organs, such as liver and lung. However, the mechanism is unknown. Here, we explored the role of copper in kidney fibrosis development and possible underlying mechanisms. We found that copper transporter 1 (CTR1) expression was increased in the kidney tissues in two fibrosis models and in patients with kidney fibrosis. Similar results were also found in renal tubular epithelial cells and fibroblast cells treated with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Mechanistically, the upregulation of CTR1 required Smads-dependent TGF-β signaling pathway and Smad3 directly binded to the promoter of CTR1 in renal fibroblast cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Elevated CTR1 induced increase of copper intracellular influx. The elevated intracellular copper ions activated lysyl oxidase (LOX) to enhance the crosslinking of collagen and elastin, which then promoted kidney fibrosis. Reducing intracellular copper accumulation by knocking down CTR1 ameliorated kidney fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction induced renal fibrosis model and renal fibroblast cells stimulated by TGF-β. Treatment with copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TM) also alleviated renal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, intracellular copper accumulation plays a unique role to kidney fibrosis by activating LOX mediated collagen and elastin crosslinking. Inhibition of intracellular copper overload may be a potential portal to alleviate kidney fibrosis."
"RNA-sequencing-based microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures have revealed that miR-148a-5p (the passenger strand of the miR-148a-duplex) is downregulated in various kinds of cancer tissues. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that low expression of miR-148a-5p was predictive of a lower survival rate (p = 0.041) in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Downregulation of miR-148a-5p was confirmed in GC clinical specimens, and its ectopic expression attenuated GC cell proliferation. Our search for miRNA target genes identified a total of 18 oncogenic targets of miR-148a-5p in GC cells. Among these targets, high expression levels of six genes (THBS2, P4HA3, SERPINH1, CDH11, BCAT1, and KCNG3) were closely associated with a poor prognosis (10-year survival rates) in GC patients (p < 0.05) according to TCGA database analyses. Furthermore, we focused on SERPINH1 as a chaperone protein involved in collagen folding in humans. Aberrant expression of SERPINH1 (mRNA and protein levels) was confirmed in GC clinical specimens. Knockdown assays of SERPINH1 using siRNAs resulted in inhibition of the aggressive phenotype of GC cells. Exploring the molecular networks controlled by miRNAs (including miRNA passenger strands) will broaden our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of GC."
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows an increasing prevalence and is associated with the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis as the major risk factors of liver-related mortality in this disease. The therapeutic possibilities are limited and restricted to life style intervention, since specific drugs for NAFLD are unavailable so far. TNFα has been implicated as a major pathogenic driver of NAFLD. TNFα-mediated liver injury occurs mainly via TNF-receptor-1 (TNFR1) signaling, whereas TNFR2 mediates protective pathways. In this study, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of a novel antibody, which selectively inhibits TNFR1 while retaining protective TNFR2 signaling in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of NAFLD. Mice were fed with HFD for 32 weeks and treated with anti-TNFR1-antibody or control-antibody for the last 8 weeks. We then investigated the mechanisms of TNFR1 inhibition on liver steatosis, inflammatory liver injury, insulin resistance and fibrosis. Compared to control-antibody treatment, TNFR1 inhibition significantly reduced liver steatosis and triglyceride content, which was accompanied by reduced expression and activation of the transcription factor SREBP1 and downstream target genes of lipogenesis. Furthermore, inhibition of TNFR1 resulted in reduced activation of the MAP kinase MKK7 and its downstream target JNK, which was associated with significant improvement of insulin resistance. Apoptotic liver injury, NAFLD activity and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, as well as liver fibrosis significantly decreased by anti-TNFR1 compared to control-antibody treatment. Thus, our results suggest selective TNFR1 inhibition as a promising approach for NAFLD treatment."
"The Lemon Frost is a new colour morph of the leopard gecko, which emerged in ca. 2015 as a result of selective breeding and spontaneous mutation. According to multiple breeders observation of Lemon Frost inbreeding with wild-type leopard geckos, Lemon Frost seems to be a codominant trait. Additionally breeders observed another, presumably associated trait - tumour-like skin lesions. Three private-owned Lemon Frost morph leopard geckos with tumour-like skin lesions were admitted to our clinic for examination, which included histopathology, X-ray and ultrasonography. The histopathological investigation of the biopsies indicated malignant iridophoroma; however, no changes were observed in diagnostic imaging. This research is the first report of clinical and histopathological findings of iridophoroma in leopard geckos."
"We used a multi-omics profiling approach to investigate the suppressive effects of 2% Wolfberry (WOL)-enriched diets on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. It was observed that in mice fed the WOL diet, the disease activity index, colon shortening, plasma concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-3 and relative mesenteric fat weight were significantly improved as compared to the DSS group. Results from colon transcriptome and proteome profiles showed that WOL supplementation significantly ameliorated the expression of genes and proteins associated with the integrity of the colonic mucosal wall and colonic inflammation. Based on the hepatic transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data, genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, proteins involved in inflammation and metabolites related to glycolysis were downregulated in WOL mice, leading to lowered inflammation and changes in these molecules may have led to improvement in body weight loss. The integrated nutrigenomic approach thus revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effect of whole WOL fruit consumption on inflammatory bowel disease."
"BackgroundIt is not clear how the pathology, presentation and outcome for patients who present with de novo metastatic breast cancer (dnMBC) compare with those who later develop distant metastases. DnMBC is uncommon in younger patients. We describe these differences within a cohort of young patients in the United Kingdom.MethodsWomen aged 40 years or younger with a first invasive breast cancer were recruited to the prospective POSH national cohort study. Baseline clinicopathological data were collected, with annual follow-up. Overall survival (OS) and post-distant relapse-free survival (PDRS) were assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves.ResultsIn total, 862 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease. DnMBC prevalence was 2.6% (76/2977). Of those with initially localised disease, 27.1% (786/2901) subsequently developed a distant recurrence. Median follow-up was 11.00 years (95% CI 10.79–11.59). Patients who developed metastatic disease within 12 months had worse OS than dnMBC patients (HR 2.64; 1.84–3.77). For PDRS, dnMBC was better than all groups, including those who relapsed after 5 years. Of dnMBC patients, 1.3% had a gBRCA1, and 11.8% a gBRCA2 mutation.ConclusionsYoung women with dnMBC have better PDRS than those who develop relapsed metastatic breast cancer.

"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways need to be tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and unwanted damage to the host. Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor of TLR signaling. Here, we identified the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) as a MyD88-associated protein. SPOP was recruited to MyD88 following TLR4 activation. TLR4 activation also caused the translocation of SPOP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. SPOP depletion promoted the aggregation of MyD88 and recruitment of the downstream signaling kinases IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. Consistently, overexpression of SPOP inhibited the TLR4-mediated activation of NF-κB and production of inflammatory cytokines, whereas SPOP depletion had the opposite effects. Furthermore, knockdown of SPOP increased MyD88 aggregation and inflammatory cytokine production upon TLR2, TLR7 and TLR9 activation. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which MyD88 is regulated and highlight a role for SPOP in limiting inflammatory responses."
"Coronary plaque distribution, frequency and cut-off value of percent stenosis for developing vasospasm are uncertain in patients with vasospastic angina (VA). We enrolled 2960 patients who received coronary angiography (CAG) and ergonovine provocation test prospectively in 11 university hospitals in Korea. A total of 1836 patients with VA and 867 without VA were included. Plaque and % stenosis were defined as ≥1% luminal narrowing and mean of each segmental stenosis. Overall frequency of plaque and % diameter stenosis was compared among VA-patients with index coronary spasm positive, those with index arterial spasm negative/other arterial spasm positive (INOP) and non-VA patients. Diameter stenosis associated with the spasm positivity was investigated. Overall plaque frequency and % stenosis were higher in VA patients than non-VA patients. Plaque frequency was 27.6% (243/881) in spasm positive at LAD, 16.4% (157/955) in LAD INOP and 12.6% (109/867) in non-VA with statistic difference (P < 0.001). Same trend for higher rate was observed in LCx and RCA. For % stenosis, 36.6 vs 32.4% (p = 0.010) in LAD, 36.1 vs. 28% (p < 0.001) in LCx and 35.3 vs.30.0% (p = 0.047) in RCA, respectively. Diameter stenosis of LAD with spasm positive vs. LAD INOP vs. non-VA were 38.3%, 34.0%, 32% (P = 0.002) with similar pattern in LCx and RCA. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, coronary stenosis of LAD ≥ 35% or LCx ≥35% or RCA ≥ 40% were independent predictor of developing spasm (OR 2.019, 95% CI 1.315–3.100, P = 0.001). In conclusions, spastic coronary artery had more plaque frequency, higher % stenosis than in non-spastic coronary in VA patients. The spasm related and unrelated coronary in VA patients had more plaque than in matched and unmatched coronary arteries in non-VA patients. Coronary stenosis ≥35% in LAD and LCx was an independent predictor of developing spasm."
"The tumor stroma acts as a barrier that limits the efficacy of systemically administered oncolytic viruses (OV). We previously demonstrated that stromal-selective, retargeted oncolytic measles viruses (MVs) delay in vivo tumor progression. To further characterize the contribution of stromal targeting to MV’s overall in vivo efficacy in an experimental cancer model, a dual targeted oncolytic measles virus (MV-CD46-muPA) able to simultaneously infect murine stromal (via murine uPAR) and human cancer (via CD46) cells was developed. MV-CD46-muPA infected, replicated, and induced cytotoxicity in both murine and human cancer cells. Viral infection was successfully transferred from stromal to tumor cells in vitro, leading to tumor cell oncolysis. Systemic administration of MV-CD46-muPA led to improved antitumor effects in colon (HT-29) cancer xenografts compared to vehicle or CD46 only targeted MVs. These effects were associated with improved tumor viral deposition, increased apoptosis, and decreases in murine stromal endothelial cells and fibroblasts. MV-CD46-muPA modulated cell cycle, survival, proliferation, and metabolic pathways, as determined by functional proteomic analysis of treated tumors. The above findings further validate the concept that dual stromal and tumor cell viral targeting enhances the therapeutic effects of systemically administered OVs and support further preclinical and clinical development of stromal directed virotherapies."
"Synucleinopathies are neurological diseases that are characterized by the accumulation of aggregates of a cytosolic protein, α-synuclein, at the plasma membrane. Even though the pathological role of the protein is established, the mechanism by which it damages neurons remains unclear due to the difficulty to correctly mimic the plasma membrane in vitro. Using a microfluidic setup in which the composition of the plasma membrane, including the asymmetry of the two leaflets, is recapitulated, we demonstrate a triple action of α-synuclein on the membrane. First, it changes membrane topology by inducing pores of discrete sizes, likely nucleated from membrane-bound proteins and subsequently enlarged by proteins in solution. Second, protein binding to the cytosolic leaflet increases the membrane capacitance by thinning it and/or changing its relative permittivity. Third, α-synuclein insertion inside the membrane hydrophobic core immobilizes the lipids in both leaflets, including the opposing protein-free extracellular one."
"Aging is associated with remodeling of the immune system to enable the maintenance of life-long immunity. In the CD8+ T cell compartment, aging results in the expansion of highly differentiated cells that exhibit characteristics of cellular senescence. Here we found that CD27−CD28−CD8+ T cells lost the signaling activity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and expressed a protein complex containing the agonistic natural killer (NK) receptor NKG2D and the NK adaptor molecule DAP12, which promoted cytotoxicity against cells that expressed NKG2D ligands. Immunoprecipitation and imaging cytometry indicated that the NKG2D–DAP12 complex was associated with sestrin 2. The genetic inhibition of sestrin 2 resulted in decreased expression of NKG2D and DAP12 and restored TCR signaling in senescent-like CD27−CD28−CD8+ T cells. Therefore, during aging, sestrins induce the reprogramming of non-proliferative senescent-like CD27−CD28−CD8+ T cells to acquire a broad-spectrum, innate-like killing activity."
"Background. It is unknown how much precociously the cigarette smoking (CS) may compromise the integrity of the cardiovascular (CV) system. Myocardial function can be routinely assessed by conventional echocardiography, but abnormalities are only detected when somewhat a remodelling has already occurred. These limitations could be overcome by strain imaging. Methods. We evaluated whether young smokers with normal left ventricular (LV) geometry, wall motion and ejection fraction may present abnormalities in myocardial deformation, both at rest and during physical effort. We selected 50 young smokers with no additional CV risk factors, and 60 non-smokers to undergo a standardized exercise-test. Consistently, we evaluated the CV adaptation to exercise by both conventional echocardiography and speckle-tracking analysis (2D-STE). Results. We found no difference between smokers and controls regarding baseline characteristics; as expected, smokers presented with lower HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.005), and higher fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (p < 0.001). Conventional echocardiography parameters were not different between groups, while we detected a different behaviour of global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS) and twist by 2D-STE during exercise-test. Indeed, GLS, GCS and twist behaved differently during exercise test in smokers with respect to controls. We found an association between CS, inflammation and LV mechanics changes uncovered by physical effort, and regression analysis confirmed that the intensity of the exposure to cigarette smoking, together with the inflammatory status (CRP, fibrinogen and Il-6) plasma levels, drive this impairment. Conclusions. We confirm strain imaging (2D-STE) as a very useful tool to identify early changes in cardiac mechanics, as adaptation to exercise; our findings may reflect a very precocious functional abnormality in active smokers, likely long before structural damage occurs."
"SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake is critical for maintaining redox balance and cell survival. Here we show that this comes at a significant cost for cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11. Actively importing cystine is potentially toxic due to its low solubility, forcing cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11 (SLC7A11high) to constitutively reduce cystine to the more soluble cysteine. This presents a significant drain on the cellular NADPH pool and renders such cells dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway. Limiting glucose supply to SLC7A11high cancer cells results in marked accumulation of intracellular cystine, redox system collapse and rapid cell death, which can be rescued by treatments that prevent disulfide accumulation. We further show that inhibitors of glucose transporters selectively kill SLC7A11high cancer cells and suppress SLC7A11high tumour growth. Our results identify a coupling between SLC7A11-associated cystine metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway, and uncover an accompanying metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting in SLC7A11high cancers."
"Atopy is excessive production of IgE in response to allergens. We evaluated in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) the following hypotheses: (1) Atopy is “curable” in atopic patients receiving HCT from a nonatopic donor (D-R+), and (2) Atopy is transferable from atopic donors to nonatopic recipients (D+R-). Atopic patients with atopic donors (D+R+) and non-atopic patients with non-atopic donors (D-R-) served as controls. We measured levels of multiallergen-specific IgE (A-IgE, atopy defined as ≥0.35 kUA/L) in sera from 54 patients and their donors pre HCT and from the patients at ≥2 years post HCT. Only 7/12 (58%) D− R+ patients became nonatopic after HCT. Only 1/11 (9%) D+R- patients became atopic. Eleven of 13 (85%) D-R- patients remained nonatopic. Unexpectedly, 11/18 (61%) D+R+ patients became nonatopic. In conclusion, contrary to our hypothesis and previous reports, the “cure” of atopy may occur in only some D-R+ patients and the transfer of atopy may occur rarely. The “cure” may not be necessarily due to the exchange of atopic for nonatopic immune system, as the “cure” may also occur in D+R+ patients."
"Value in healthcare can be defined as providing the optimal outcome per health dollar spent. Improving the value of healthcare for patients and healthcare organizations requires an understanding and evaluation of the costs and benefits. Investing in quality improvement (QI) work can bring about financial results for healthcare organizations over time, have beneficial organizational effects, and improve outcomes for patients. This article continues a series of QI educational papers in the Journal of Perinatology, and reviews financial and economic measures used to create the business case for QI. Ultimately, the business case for QI is better defined as a business strategy for success."
"Muscle-invasive bladder carcinomas (MIBCs) are aggressive genitourinary malignancies. Metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is generally incurable by current chemotherapy and leads to early mortality. Recent studies have identified molecular subtypes of MIBCs with different sensitivities to frontline therapy, suggesting tumor heterogeneity. We have performed multi-omic profiling of the kinome in bladder cancer patients with the goal of identify therapeutic targets. Our analyses revealed amplification, overexpression, and elevated kinase activity of P21 (RAC1) activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in a subset of Bladder cancer (BLCA). Using bladder cancer cells, we confirmed the role of PAK4 in BLCA cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we observed that a PAK4 inhibitor was effective in curtailing growth of BLCA cells. Transcriptomic analyses identified elevated expression of another kinase, protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), upon treatment with a PAK4 inhibitor and RNA interference of PAK4. Treatment with a combination of kinase inhibitors (vandetanib and dasatinib) showed enhanced sensitivity compared with either drug alone. Thus, PAK4 may be therapeutically actionable for a subset of MIBC patients with amplified and/or overexpressed PAK4 in their tumors. Our results also indicate that combined inhibition of PAK4 and PTK6 may overcome resistance to PAK4. These observations warrant clinical investigations with selected BLCA patients."
"ObjectivesThis study explored whether donor-milk supplementation increases breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months of life. In 10/2015, we implemented donor milk for breastfed newborns who needed nutritional supplements for hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and >8% weight loss at 40 h of life.Study designWe conducted a retrospective chart review on 122 qualified neonates admitted to newborn nursery at University of Florida Jacksonville 4 months before donor-milk implementation and 6 months after.Results73 (60%) of the neonates received formula and 49 (40%) received donor milk. 39 (54%) in the formula group and 33 (46%) in the donor-milk group were surveyed after 6 months of life. Multivariate logistic regression showed that newborns who received donor milk had five times greater odds of being exclusively breastfed at 6 months of life.ConclusionsDonor milk as feeding supplementation for newborns is associated with increased exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months of life."
"The revised 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations for genetic risk stratification of acute myeloid leukemia have been widely adopted, but have not yet been validated in large cohorts of AML patients. We studied 1116 newly diagnosed AML patients (age range, 18–86 years) who had received induction chemotherapy. Among 771 patients not selected by genetics, the ELN-2017 classification re-assigned 26.5% of patients into a more favorable or, more commonly, a more adverse-risk group compared with the ELN-2010 recommendations. Forty percent of the cohort, and 51% of patients ≥60 years, were classified as adverse-risk by ELN-2017. In 599 patients <60 years, estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 64% for ELN-2017 favorable, 42% for intermediate-risk and 20% for adverse-risk patients. Among 517 patients aged ≥60 years, corresponding 5-year OS rates were 37, 16, and 6%. Patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations or inv(16) had particularly favorable outcomes, while patients with mutated TP53 and a complex karyotype had especially poor prognosis. DNMT3A mutations associated with inferior OS within each ELN-2017 risk group. Our results validate the prognostic significance of the revised ELN-2017 risk classification in AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy across a broad age range. Further refinement of the ELN-2017 risk classification is possible."
"In order to evaluate the technical adaptability of a type of disposable endoscope compared to reusable flexible endoscopes, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted. A disposable digital ureteroscope (“chip on tip”) and two reusable endoscopes were investigated with respect to spatial resolution, geometric distortion in air and water the maximum. Additionally, the clinical performance of the disposable device was tested during clinical procedures (n = 20). The disposable endoscope showed an optical resolution of 6.72 lines/mm at 10 mm distance, similar to the other devices. In comparison, the disposable endoscope showed a barrel-shaped image distortion in air of −24.2%, which is in the middle range, but was best under water (−8.6%). The bendability of 297° (275 µm fiber) and 316° (empty channel, 1.5 F basket) and the maximum irrigation (1 m: 58.1 ml/min, 2 m: 91.9 ml/min) were convincing. Clinically the maneuverability was very good in (13/20), good or satisfactory in (7/20). Visibility was evaluated as very good in (11/20), just in (1/20) either satisfactory or sufficient. The consistency of visibility was not affected in (19/20). In all cases there were no adverse events. The technical examination and clinical application of the disposable endoscope are of equal quality compared to reusable devices. Disposable endoscopes can be an alternative to reusable devices, but economic aspects such as reduction of repair costs, sterilization effort and additional waste must be taken into account."
"When the microfloral composition deteriorates, it triggers low-level chronic inflammation associated with several lifestyle-related diseases including obesity and diabetic mellitus. Fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been found to differ in gastrointestinal diseases as well as intestinal infection. In this study, to evaluate a potential association between the pathogenesis of lifestyle-related diseases and VOCs in the intestinal tract, fecal VOCs from obese/diabetic KK-Ay mice (KK) or controls (C57BL/6J mice; BL) fed a normal or high fat diet (NFD or HFD) were investigated using headspace sampler-GC-EI-MS. Principal component analysis (PCA) of fecal VOC profiles clearly separated the experimental groups depending on the mouse lineage (KK vs BL) and the diet type (NFD vs HFD). 16 s rRNA sequencing revealed that the PCA distribution of VOCs was in parallel with the microfloral composition. We identified that some volatile metabolites including n-alkanals (nonanal and octanal), acetone and phenol were significantly increased in the HFD and/or KK groups. Additionally, these volatile metabolites induced proinflammatory activity in the RAW264 murine macrophage cell line indicating these bioactive metabolites might trigger low-level chronic inflammation. These results suggest that proinflammatory VOCs detected in HFD-fed and/or diabetic model mice might be novel noninvasive diagnosis biomarkers for diabetes."
"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has grown to become the dominant form of heart failure worldwide, in tandem with ageing of the general population and the increasing prevalences of obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The clinical syndrome of HFpEF is heterogeneous and must be distinguished from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as well as other aetiologies that have different treatment strategies. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging and ultimately relates to the conceptual definition of heart failure as a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms that are associated with a reduced capacity of the heart to pump blood adequately at normal filling pressures during diastole. Clinical trials to date have been largely unsuccessful in identifying effective treatments for HFpEF but evidence supports the use of diuretics, mineralocorticoid antagonists and lifestyle interventions. Pathophysiological heterogeneity in the presentation of HFpEF is substantial, and ongoing studies are underway to evaluate the optimal methods to classify patients into phenotypically homogeneous subpopulations to facilitate better individualization of treatment."
"BackgroundCancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumour initiation, metastasis and recurrence. However, the mechanism of CSC formation, maintenance and expansion in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly characterised.MethodsThe role of COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) in regulating cancer stemness was evaluated by organoid formation and limited dilution analysis. The role of CSN6–TRIM21–OCT1–ALDH1A1 axis in CSC formation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The association of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 expression was validated by a tissue microarray with 267 CRC patients.ResultsThe results showed that CSN6 is critical for sphere formation and maintaining the growth of patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We characterised the role of CSN6 in regulating cancer stemness, which involves the TRIM21 E3 ubiquitin ligase, transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 1 (OCT1) and cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1A1). Our data showed that CSN6 facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRIM21, which in turn decreases TRIM21-mediated OCT1 ubiquitination and subsequently stabilises OCT1. Consequently, OCT1 stabilisation leads to ALDH1A1expression and promotes cancer stemness. We further showed that the protein expression levels of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 can serve as prognostic markers for human CRC.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we validate a pathway for cancer stemness regulation involving ALDH1A1 levels through the CSN6–TRIM21 axis, which may be utilised as CRC molecular markers and be targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancers."
"Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is a rare autoimmune cause of kidney failure. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for primary MN in 3,782 cases and 9,038 controls of East Asian and European ancestries. We discover two previously unreported loci, NFKB1 (﻿rs230540, OR = 1.25, P = 3.4 × 10−12) and IRF4 (﻿rs9405192, OR = 1.29, P = ﻿1.4 × 10−14), fine-map the PLA2R1 locus (﻿rs17831251, OR = 2.25, P = 4.7 × 10−103) and report ancestry-specific effects of three classical HLA alleles: DRB1*1501 in East Asians (OR = 3.81, P = 2.0 × 10−49), DQA1*0501 in Europeans (OR = 2.88, P = 5.7 × 10−93), and DRB1*0301 in both ethnicities (OR = 3.50, P = 9.2 × 10−23 and OR = 3.39, P = 5.2 × 10−82, respectively). GWAS loci explain 32% of disease risk in East Asians and 25% in Europeans, and correctly re-classify 20–37% of the cases in validation cohorts that are antibody-negative by the serum anti-PLA2R ELISA diagnostic test. Our findings highlight an unusual genetic architecture of MN, with four loci and their interactions accounting for nearly one-third of the disease risk."
"Mining the antibody repertoire of plasma cells and plasmablasts could enable the discovery of useful antibodies for therapeutic or research purposes1. We present a method for high-throughput, single-cell screening of IgG-secreting primary cells to characterize antibody binding to soluble and membrane-bound antigens. CelliGO is a droplet microfluidics system that combines high-throughput screening for IgG activity, using fluorescence-based in-droplet single-cell bioassays2, with sequencing of paired antibody V genes, using in-droplet single-cell barcoded reverse transcription. We analyzed IgG repertoire diversity, clonal expansion and somatic hypermutation in cells from mice immunized with a vaccine target, a multifunctional enzyme or a membrane-bound cancer target. Immunization with these antigens yielded 100–1,000 IgG sequences per mouse. We generated 77 recombinant antibodies from the identified sequences and found that 93% recognized the soluble antigen and 14% the membrane antigen. The platform also allowed recovery of ~450–900 IgG sequences from ~2,200 IgG-secreting activated human memory B cells, activated ex vivo, demonstrating its versatility."
"This study aimed to evaluate treatment response, survival, safety profiles, and predictive factors to chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (R/R B-ALL). 39R/R B-ALL patients who underwent CAR-T therapy were included. Baseline data were collected from patients’ electronic medical records. Patients’ peripheral bloods, bone marrow aspirates, and biopsies were obtained for routine examination, and treatment response and survival profiles as well as adverse events were evaluated. The rates of complete remission (CR), CR with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative/positive, and bridging to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) were 92.3%, 76.9%, 15.4%, and 43.6%, respectively. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 11.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0–19.2 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 14.0 months (95% CI: 10.9–17.1 months). Bridging to HSCT independently predicted better EFS and OS, while high bone marrow blasts level independently predicted worse EFS. The incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was 97.4%, and refractory disease as well as decreased white blood cell independently predicted higher risk of severe CRS. Other common adverse events included hematologic toxicities (grade I: 5.1%, grade II: 7.7%, grade III: 17.9%, grade IV: 69.2%), neurotoxicity (28.2%), infection (38.5%), and admission for intensive care unit (10.3%). In conclusion, CAR-T therapy presents with promising treatment response, survival and safety profiles, and higher disease burden predicts worse survival as well as increased risk of severe CRS in Chinese R/R B-ALL patients."
"To optimize the placement of iliosacral screws in osteoporotic bone it is essential to know where to find the best purchase. The aim of this study was to determine and visualize the distribution of bone mass in the posterior pelvic ring by using a color-coded thermal map, to differentiate the bone distribution patterns in normal pelvises and in pelvises with impaired bone density and to identify zones in S1 and S2 with particularly good bone quality, in both healthy and osteoporotic pelvises. A total of 324 pelvises were included. The bone density of the posterior pelvic ring, the fifth lumbar vertebral body (L5) and screw corridors S1 and S2 were visualized. Each individual pelvis was measured with a 3D automated program. Two groups were selected - patients with mean bone density in L5 of ≤100 HU (group 1, n = 52) and those with mean bone density >100 HU (group 2, n = 272). Color-coded thermal maps are presented of the bone density distribution in the pelvises. Bone density in L5 correlated significantly with S1 and S2; bone density was significantly higher in the S1 than in the S2 corridor (p < 0.001). Bone was denser in the posterior and upper parts of the S1 body. Bone density was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (p < 0.001). The color-coded “thermal” maps of bone mass distribution can help surgeons to decide where sacroiliac screws are likely to find optimal purchase."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants that are associated with lung cancer risk, but the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain largely unknown. Here we investigated the functional relevance of a genetic region in 6q22.2 which was identified to be associated with lung cancer risk in our previous GWAS. We performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis and bioinformatic prediction to screen functional SNPs linked to a tagSNP in 6q22.2 loci, followed by two case-control studies and a meta-analysis with 4403 cases and 5336 controls to identify if these functional SNPs were associated with lung cancer risk. A novel SNP rs17079281 in the DCBLD1 promoter was identified to be associated with lung cancer risk in Chinese populations. Compared with those with C allele, patients with T allele had lower risk of adenocarcinoma (adjusted OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80–0.92), but not squamous cell carcinoma (adjusted OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.91–1.10), and patients with the C/T or T/T genotype had lower levels of DCBLD1 expression than those with C/C genotype in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. We performed functional assays to characterize its biological relevance. The results showed that the T allele of rs17079281 had higher binding affinity to transcription factor YY1 than the C allele, which suppressed DCBLD1 expression. DCBLD1 behaved like an oncogene, promoting tumor growth by influencing cell cycle progression. These findings suggest that the functional variant rs17079281C>T decreased lung adenocarcinoma risk by creating an YY1-binding site to suppress DCBLD1 expression, which may serve as a biomarker for assessing lung cancer susceptibility."
"BackgroundProstate cancer exhibits biological and clinical heterogeneity even within established clinico-pathologic risk groups. The Decipher genomic classifier (GC) is a validated method to further risk-stratify disease in patients with prostate cancer, but its performance solely within National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk disease has not been undertaken to date.MethodsA multi-institutional retrospective study of 405 men with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent primary treatment with ﻿radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) at 11 centers from 1995 to 2005 was performed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the hazard ratios (HR) for the development of metastatic disease based on clinico-pathologic variables, risk groups, and GC score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was determined for regression models without and with the GC score.ResultsOver a median follow-up of 82 months, 104 patients (26%) developed metastatic disease. On univariable analysis, increasing GC score was significantly associated with metastatic disease ([HR]: 1.34 per 0.1 unit increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–1.50, p < 0.001), while age, serum PSA, biopsy GG, and clinical T-stage were not (all p > 0.05). On multivariable analysis, GC score (HR: 1.33 per 0.1 unit increase, 95% CI: 1.19–1.48, p < 0.001) and GC high-risk (vs low-risk, HR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.79–4.87, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with metastasis. The addition of GC score to regression models based on NCCN risk group improved model AUC from 0.46 to 0.67, and CAPRA from 0.59 to 0.71.ConclusionsAmong men with high-risk prostate cancer, conventional clinico-pathologic data had poor discrimination to risk stratify development of metastatic disease. GC score was a significant and independent predictor of metastasis and may help identify men best suited for treatment intensification/de-escalation."
"Drosophila melanogaster is a useful and highly tractable model organism for understanding the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. We previously characterized a new dUbqn knockdown model that induces learning-memory and locomotive deficits mediated by impaired proteostasis. Although proteinopathies are the main causes of neurodegenerative diseases, limited information is currently available on the relationship between proteostasis and neurodegenerative-related behavioral perturbations, such as locomotion, wakefulness, and sexual activities. Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which dUbqn depletion which is known to cause proteinopathies, affects neurodegenerative-related behavioral perturbations. Pan-neuronal dUbqn-depleted flies showed significantly reduced evening activity along with altered pre- and postsynaptic structural NMJ’s proteins by attenuating signals of Bruchpilot puncta and GluRIIA clustering. In addition, the neurochemical profiles of GABA, glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin were disturbed and these changes also affected courtship behaviors in dUbqn-depleted flies. Collectively, these results extend our understanding on how dUbqn depletion affects neurochemical regulation to drive behavioral disturbances that are generally found in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the present study may contribute a novel finding to the design of new agents that prevent disease progression or even treat diseases related to neurodegeneration."
"High-dose radiation activates caspases in tumor cells to produce abundant DNA fragments for DNA sensing in antigen-presenting cells, but the intrinsic DNA sensing in tumor cells after radiation is rather limited. Here we demonstrate that irradiated tumor cells hijack caspase 9 signaling to suppress intrinsic DNA sensing. Instead of apoptotic genomic DNA, tumor-derived mitochondrial DNA triggers intrinsic DNA sensing. Specifically, loss of mitochondrial DNA sensing in Casp9−/− tumors abolishes the enhanced therapeutic effect of radiation. We demonstrated that combining emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, with radiation generates synergistic therapeutic effects. Moreover, loss of CASP9 signaling in tumor cells led to adaptive resistance by upregulating programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and resulted in tumor relapse. Additional anti-PD-L1 blockade can further overcome this acquired immune resistance. Therefore, combining radiation with a caspase inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 can effectively control tumors by sequentially blocking both intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitory signaling."
"We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) on preoperative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in pathological T3b prostate cancer (PCa). We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients who underwent preoperative mpMRI and subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP). A total of 159 patients with pathologic T3b PCa were stratified into two groups based on mpMRI findings (negative vs. positive SVI). A positive SVI was defined as the presence of mpMRI evidence of SVI. In addition, 290 patients with pathologic T3a were also included in this study for further comparative analysis. Fifty-two patients (32.7%) had a positive SVI on preoperative mpMRI. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in a total of 45 (28.3%) patients, with 25 (23.4%) cases in the negative SVI group and 20 (38.5%) cases in the positive SVI group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the two groups revealed significantly decreased BCR-free survival in the positive SVI group (median, 21 vs. 9 months, log-rank test, P < 0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, pre-biopsy PSA (P = 0.035) and positive SVI on preoperative mpMRI (P = 0.049) were identified as significant predictors of BCR. Upon further comparative analysis with the pathologic T3a group, we also found significant differences among the groups throughout the Kaplan-Meier curve (P < 0.001). Conclusively, the unpredicted (negative) SVI group had a favorable BCR-free survival compared to the positive SVI group. In addition, significant differences were observed in the prognosis of pathologic T3a and these two groups. This suggests that pathologic T3b can be stratified into two categories."
"CLN5 disease is a rare form of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) caused by mutations in the CLN5 gene that encodes a protein whose primary function and physiological roles remains unresolved. Emerging lines of evidence point to mitochondrial dysfunction in the onset and progression of several forms of NCL, offering new insights into putative biomarkers and shared biological processes. In this work, we employed cellular and murine models of the disease, in an effort to clarify disease pathways associated with CLN5 depletion. A mitochondria-focused quantitative proteomics approach followed by functional validations using cell biology and immunofluorescence assays revealed an impairment of mitochondrial functions in different CLN5 KO cell models and in Cln5−/− cerebral cortex, which well correlated with disease progression. A visible impairment of autophagy machinery coupled with alterations of key parameters of mitophagy activation process functionally linked CLN5 protein to the process of neuronal injury. The functional link between impaired cellular respiration and activation of mitophagy pathways in the human CLN5 disease condition was corroborated by translating organelle-specific proteome findings to CLN5 patients’ fibroblasts. Our study highlights the involvement of CLN5 in activation of mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis offering new insights into alternative strategies towards the CLN5 disease treatment."
"BackgroundMolecular oxygen (O2) plays a key role in normal and pathological adipose tissue function, yet technologies to measure its role in adipose tissue function are limited. O2 is paramagnetic and, in principle, directly influences the magnetic resonance (MR) 1H longitudinal relaxation rate constant of lipids, R1; thus, we hypothesize that MR imaging (MRI) can directly measure adipose O2 via a simple measure of R1.MethodsR1 was measured in a 4.7T preclinical MRI system at discrete oxygen partial pressure (pO2) levels. These measures were made in vitro in an idealized system and in vivo in subcutaneous and visceral white adipose of rodents. pO2 was determined using an invasive fiber-optic oxygen monitor. From the MRI and fiber optic data we determined the “relaxivity” of O2 in lipid, a critical parameter in converting the MRI-based R1 measurement into pO2. We used breathing gas challenge to estimate the changes in lipid pO2 (ΔpO2).ResultsThe relaxivity of O2 in lipid was determined to be 1.7·10−3 ± 4·10−4 mmHg−1s−1 at 4.7T and 37 °C, and was consistent between in vitro and in vivo adipose tissue. There was a strong, significant correlation between MRI- and gold standard OxyLite-based measurements of lipid ΔpO2 for in vivo visceral and subcutaneous fat depots in rodents.ConclusionThis study lays the foundation for a direct, noninvasive measure of adipose pO2 using MRI and will allow for noninvasive measurement of O2 flux in adipose tissue. The proposed approach would be of particular importance in the interrogation of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, where it has been suggested that adipose tissue hypoxia is an independent driver of insulin resistance pathway."
"BackgroundSmoking and alcohol increase risk for colorectal malignancies. However, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogenic disease and associations with the molecular pathological pathways are unclear.MethodsThis population-based case–control study includes 2444 cases with first-diagnosis CRC and 2475 controls. Tumour tissue was analysed for MSI (microsatellite instability), CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype), BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase gene) and KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue gene) mutations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for associations between alcohol and smoking and CRC molecular subtypes and pathways.ResultsCurrent smoking showed higher ORs for MSI-high (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.86–4.18) compared to MSS (OR = 1.41, 1.14–1.75, p-heterogeneity (p-het) = 0.001), BRAF-mutated (mut) (OR = 2.40, 1.41–4.07) compared to BRAF-wild type (wt) (OR = 1.52, 1.24–1.88, p-het = 0.074), KRAS-wt (OR = 1.70, 1.36–2.13) compared to KRAS-mut (OR = 1.26, 0.95–1.68, p-het = 0.039) and CIMP-high (OR = 2.01, 1.40–2.88) compared to CIMP-low/negative CRC (OR = 1.50, 1.22–1.85, p-het=0.101). Current smoking seemed more strongly associated with sessile serrated pathway (CIMP-high + BRAF-mut; OR = 2.39, 1.27–4.52) than with traditional pathway CRC (MSS + CIMP-low/negative + BRAF-wt; OR = 1.50, 1.16–1.94) and no association was observed with alternate pathway CRC (MSS + CIMP-low/negative + KRAS-wt; OR = 1.08, 0.77–1.43). No heterogeneity was observed in alcohol consumption association by molecular subtypes.ConclusionsIn this large case–control study, smoking was more strongly associated with MSI-high and KRAS-wt CRC and with cases showing features of the sessile serrated pathway. Association patterns were less clear for alcohol consumption."
"Compulsion is a cardinal symptom of drug addiction (severe substance use disorder). However, compulsion is observed in only a small proportion of individuals who repeatedly seek and use addictive substances. Here, we integrate accounts of the neuropharmacological mechanisms that underlie the transition to compulsion with overarching learning theories, to outline how compulsion develops in addiction. Importantly, we emphasize the conceptual distinctions between compulsive drug-seeking behaviour and compulsive drug-taking behaviour (that is, use). In the latter, an individual cannot stop using a drug despite major negative consequences, possibly reflecting an imbalance in frontostriatal circuits that encode reward and aversion. By contrast, an individual may compulsively seek drugs (that is, persist in seeking drugs despite the negative consequences of doing so) when the neural systems that underlie habitual behaviour dominate goal-directed behavioural systems, and when executive control over this maladaptive behaviour is diminished. This distinction between different aspects of addiction may help to identify its neural substrates and new treatment strategies."
"A key metabolic activity of the gut microbiota is the fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrate, which generates short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as the principal end products. SCFAs are absorbed from the gut lumen and modulate host metabolic responses at different organ sites. Evidence suggests that these organ sites include skeletal muscle, the largest organ in humans, which plays a pivotal role in whole-body energy metabolism. In this Review, we evaluate the evidence indicating that SCFAs mediate metabolic cross-talk between the gut microbiota and skeletal muscle. We discuss the effects of three primary SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) on lipid, carbohydrate and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle, and we consider the potential mechanisms involved. Furthermore, we highlight the emerging roles of these gut-derived metabolites in skeletal muscle function and exercise capacity, present limitations in current knowledge and provide suggestions for future work."
"Understanding the specific gene changes underlying the prodromic stages of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis will aid the development of new, targeted therapeutic strategies for this neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we employed RNA-sequencing to analyze global differential gene expression in a defined model nerve cell line expressing α4β2 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), high-affinity targets for beta amyloid (Aβ). The nAChR-expressing neuronal cells were treated with nanomolar Aβ1–42 to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in the presence of this sensitizing target receptor. We identified 15 genes (out of 15,336) that were differentially expressed upon receptor-linked Aβ treatment. Genes up-regulated with Aβ treatment were associated with calcium signaling and axonal vesicle transport (including the α4 nAChR subunit, the calcineurin regulator RCAN3, and KIF1C of the kinesin family). Downregulated genes were associated with metabolic, apoptotic or DNA repair pathways (including APBA3, PARP1 and RAB11). Validation of the differential expression was performed via qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis in the defined model nerve cell line and primary mouse neurons. Further verification was performed using immunocytochemistry. In conclusion, we identified apparent changes in gene expression on Aβ treatment in the presence of the sensitizing nAChRs, linked to early-stage Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, which may represent novel therapeutic targets."
"Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies in the past 10 years have had a transformative effect on biomedical research, enabling the profiling and analysis of the transcriptomes of single cells at unprecedented resolution and throughput. Specifically, scRNA-seq has facilitated the identification of novel or rare cell types, the analysis of single-cell trajectory construction and stem or progenitor cell differentiation, and the comparison of healthy and disease-related tissues at single-cell resolution. These applications have been critical in advances in cardiovascular research in the past decade as evidenced by the generation of cell atlases of mammalian heart and blood vessels and the elucidation of mechanisms involved in cardiovascular development and stem or progenitor cell differentiation. In this Review, we summarize the currently available scRNA-seq technologies and analytical tools and discuss the latest findings using scRNA-seq that have substantially improved our knowledge on the development of the cardiovascular system and the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, we examine emerging strategies that integrate multimodal single-cell platforms, focusing on future applications in cardiovascular precision medicine that use single-cell omics approaches to characterize cell-specific responses to drugs or environmental stimuli and to develop effective patient-specific therapeutics."
"The long-term function of transplanted therapeutic cells typically requires systemic immune suppression. Here, we show that a retrievable implant comprising a silicone reservoir and a porous polymeric membrane protects human cells encapsulated in it after implant transplantation in the intraperitoneal space of immunocompetent mice. Membranes with pores 1 µm in diameter allowed host macrophages to migrate into the device without the loss of transplanted cells, whereas membranes with pore sizes <0.8 µm prevented their infiltration by immune cells. A synthetic polymer coating prevented fibrosis and was necessary for the long-term function of the device. For >130 days, the device supported human cells engineered to secrete erythropoietin in immunocompetent mice, as well as transgenic human cells carrying an inducible gene circuit for the on-demand secretion of erythropoietin. Pancreatic islets from rats encapsulated in the device and implanted in diabetic mice restored normoglycaemia in the mice for over 75 days. The biocompatible device provides a retrievable solution for the transplantation of engineered cells in the absence of immunosuppression."
"Glucokinase-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY or MODY 2), caused by a heterozygous inactivating variant in the Glucokinase (GCK) gene, is a common form of MODY. Here, we present a case of GCK-MODY in a young Chinese boy, his sister and his father with a novel pathogenic variant in exon 8 of the GCK gene, NM_000162.5:c.1015del, p.(Glu339Argfs*14), which is predicted to cause a significant change in protein structure and function."
"Methionine-1 (M1)-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) control NF-κB activation, immune homoeostasis, and prevents tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death. The deubiquitinase OTULIN negatively regulates M1-linked polyubiquitin signalling by removing the chains conjugated by LUBAC, and OTULIN deficiency causes OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) in humans. However, the cellular pathways and physiological functions controlled by OTULIN remain poorly understood. Here, we show that OTULIN prevents development of liver disease in mice and humans. In an ORAS patient, OTULIN deficiency caused spontaneous and progressive steatotic liver disease at 10–13 months of age. Similarly, liver-specific deletion of OTULIN in mice leads to neonatally onset steatosis and hepatitis, akin to the ORAS patient. OTULIN deficiency triggers metabolic alterations, apoptosis, and inflammation in the liver. In mice, steatosis progresses to steatohepatitis, fibrosis and pre-malignant tumour formation by 8 weeks of age, and by the age of 7–12 months the phenotype has advanced to malignant hepatocellular carcinoma. Surprisingly, the pathology in OTULIN-deficient livers is independent of TNFR1 signalling. Instead, we find that steatohepatitis in OTULIN-deficient livers is associated with aberrant mTOR activation, and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin administration significantly reduces the liver pathology. Collectively, our results reveal that OTULIN is critical for maintaining liver homoeostasis and suggest that M1-linked polyubiquitin chains may play a role in regulation of mTOR signalling and metabolism in the liver."
"Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) increases proximal pressure, and simultaneously induces distal ischemia. We aimed to evaluate organ ischemia during partial REBOA (P-REBOA) with computed tomography (CT) perfusion in a swine model. The maximum balloon volume was recorded as total REBOA when the distal pulse pressure ceased. The animals (n = 4) were scanned at each 20% of the maximum balloon volume, and time-density curve (TDC) were analysed at the aorta, portal vein (PV), liver parenchyma, and superior mesenteric vein (SMV, indicating mesenteric perfusion). The area under the TDC (AUTDC), the time to peak (TTP), and four-dimensional volume-rendering images (4D-VR) were evaluated. The TDC of the both upper and lower aorta showed an increased peak and delayed TTP. The TDC of the PV, liver, and SMV showed a decreased peak and delayed TTP. The dynamic 4D-CT analysis suggested that organ perfusion changes according to balloon volume. The AUTDC at the PV, liver, and SMV decreased linearly with balloon inflation percentage to the maximum volume. 4D-VR demonstrated the delay of the washout in the aorta and retrograde flow at the inferior vena cava in the highly occluded status."
"The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) ‘fast-fail’ approach seeks to improve too-often-misleading early-phase drug development methods by incorporating biomarker-based proof-of-mechanism (POM) testing in phase 2a. This first comprehensive application of the fast-fail approach evaluated the potential of κ-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonism for treating anhedonia with a POM study determining whether robust target engagement favorably impacts the brain circuitry hypothesized to mediate clinical effects. Here we report the results from a multicenter, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with anhedonia and a mood or anxiety disorder (selective KOR antagonist (JNJ-67953964, 10 mg; n = 45) and placebo (n = 44)). JNJ-67953964 significantly increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation (primary outcome) as compared to placebo (baseline-adjusted mean: JNJ-67953964, 0.72 (s.d. = 0.67); placebo, 0.33 (s.d. = 0.68); F(1,86) = 5.58, P < 0.01; effect size = 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.99)). JNJ-67953964, generally well tolerated, was not associated with any serious adverse events. This study supports proceeding with assessment of the clinical impact of target engagement and serves as a model for implementing the ‘fast-fail’ approach."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of new Corneal Visualisation Scheimpflug Technology (Corvis ST) parameters in normal, Post-laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), Post-LASIK keratectasia (KE) and keratoconus (KC) eyes, and explore the diagnostic ability of these parameters in distinguishing KE from LASIK eyes. Twenty-three normal eyes, 23 LASIK eyes, 23 KE eyes and 23 KC eyes were recruited in this study. The following new Corvis ST parameters were measured: Max Inverse Radius, deformation amplitude (DA) Ratio Max [2 mm], Pachy Slope, DA Ratio Max [1 mm], Ambrosio’s relational thickness horizontal (ARTh), Integrated Radius, stiffness parameter at first applanation (SP-A1) and Corvis biomechanical index (CBI). The general linear model, linear regression model, relation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed. The Max Inverse Radius, DA Ratio Max [2 mm], Pachy Slope, DA Ratio Max [1 mm], Integrated Radius and CBI in LASIK eyes, KE eyes and KC eyes were higher than in normal eyes, while the ARTh and SP-A1 parameters were lower than in normal eyes. The KE eyes had higher Max Inverse Radius, DA Ratio Max [2 mm], Pachy Slope, DA Ratio Max [1 mm], Integrated Radius, and lower SP-A1 value than LASIK eyes (all P < 0.05). The central corneal thickness was related to the Pachy Slope (r = −0.485), ARTh (r = −0.766), SP-A1 (r = 0.618) in KE eyes (all P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve of Integrated Radius, Max Inverse Radius, DA Ratio Max [2 mm] and SP-A1 were above 0.800 in identifying KE from LASIK eyes. Thus, the new Corvis ST parameters were different between LASIK and KE eyes, suggesting that they might be helpful in distinguishing KE eyes from LASIK eyes. However, a further multi-center and large sample study is necessary to confirm these findings."
"Gastric cancer (GC) has a high mortality rate, and metastasis is the main reason for treatment failure. It is important to study the mechanism of tumour invasion and metastasis based on the regulation of key genes. In a previous study comparing the expression differences between GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells, PCDHGA9 was selected for further research. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PCDHGA9 inhibited invasion and metastasis. A cluster analysis suggested that PCDHGA9 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β pathways. Laser confocal techniques and western blotting revealed that PCDHGA9 inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, regulated T cell factor (TCF)/ /lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcriptional activity, directly impacted the signal transmission of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway, strengthened the adhesion complex, weakened the effects of TGF-β, and blocked the activation of the Wnt pathway. In addition, PCDHGA9 expression was regulated by methylation, which was closely related to poor clinical prognosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PCDHGA9 inhibits EMT and metastasis in GC to provide a new theoretical basis for identifying GC metastasis and a new target for improving the outcome of metastatic GC."
"Recent studies have suggested that vitamin D activities involve vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent and VDR-independent effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and ligand-independent effects of the VDR. Here, we describe a novel in vivo system using genetically modified rats deficient in the Cyp27b1 or Vdr genes. Type II rickets model rats with a mutant Vdr (R270L), which recognizes 1,25(OH)2D3 with an affinity equivalent to that for 25(OH)D3, were also generated. Although Cyp27b1-knockout (KO), Vdr-KO, and Vdr (R270L) rats each showed rickets symptoms, including abnormal bone formation, they were significantly different from each other. Administration of 25(OH)D3 reversed rickets symptoms in Cyp27b1-KO and Vdr (R270L) rats. Interestingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 was synthesized in Cyp27b1-KO rats, probably by Cyp27a1. In contrast, the effects of 25(OH)D3 on Vdr (R270L) rats strongly suggested a direct action of 25(OH)D3 via VDR-genomic pathways. These results convincingly suggest the usefulness of our in vivo system."
"Happiness and depression are interlinked and both heritable, while personality, as an important predictor of them, shares the genetic basis with them. We conjecture that genetic factors of depression can affect both depressive symptoms (DS) and subjective well-being (SWB), while personality traits play important roles in mediating this process. In this study, 878 Han Chinese college freshmen and 384 Han Chinese patients with the major depressive disorder (MDD) were included. SNPs were genotyped using AGENA MassARRAY iPLEX technology and we investigated an important MDD variant rs454214. Correlation, association and mediation analysis were employed, aiming to decipher the complex relationship between SWB, DS, personality traits and the genetic variant. Association study indicated that rs454214 was not only associated with both SWB and DS (P < 0.05), but also possibly linked to MDD. Mediational analysis showed that rs454214 had no direct effect on SWB and DS, but had a significant indirect effect through personality traits, i.e., Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Openness to Experience or SWB, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Agreeableness for DS. This study found a shared genetic basis for happiness and depression; the causal process could be better explained if personality traits are taken as mediating factors."
"Remarkable progress has been made in the development of new therapies for cancer, dramatically changing the landscape of treatment approaches for several malignancies and continuing to increase patient survival. Accordingly, adverse effects of cancer therapies that interfere with the continuation of best-possible care, induce life-threatening risks or lead to long-term morbidity are gaining increasing importance. Cardiovascular toxic effects of cancer therapeutics and radiation therapy are the epitome of such concerns, and proper knowledge, interpretation and management are needed and have to be placed within the context of the overall care of individual patients with cancer. Furthermore, the cardiotoxicity spectrum has broadened to include myocarditis with immune checkpoint inhibitors and cardiac dysfunction in the setting of cytokine release syndrome with chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. An increase in the incidence of arrhythmias related to inflammation such as atrial fibrillation can also be expected, in addition to the broadening set of cancer therapeutics that can induce prolongation of the corrected QT interval. Therefore, cardiologists of today have to be familiar not only with the cardiotoxicity associated with traditional cancer therapies, such as anthracycline, trastuzumab or radiation therapy, but even more so with an ever-increasing repertoire of therapeutics. This Review provides this information, summarizing the latest developments at the juncture of cardiology, oncology and haematology."
"Refractive errors, in particular myopia, are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide. Genetic investigation can improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie abnormal eye development and impaired vision. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that involved 542,934 European participants and identified 336 novel genetic loci associated with refractive error. Collectively, all associated genetic variants explain 18.4% of heritability and improve the accuracy of myopia prediction (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75). Our results suggest that refractive error is genetically heterogeneous, driven by genes that participate in the development of every anatomical component of the eye. In addition, our analyses suggest that genetic factors controlling circadian rhythm and pigmentation are also involved in the development of myopia and refractive error. These results may enable the prediction of refractive error and the development of personalized myopia prevention strategies in the future."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a hepatic malignancy, has a poor prognosis and contributes to cancer-related death worldwide. Cellular senescence is an anticancer therapeutic strategy that causes irreversible cell cycle arrest and enables immune-mediated clearance of cancer cells. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis or autophagy in malignant tumors. However, whether atorvastatin can induce HCC cell senescence and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The effects of atorvastatin-induced senescence were examined in both HCC cells and mouse xenograft models. The phenomenon and mechanism of senescence were examined by cell cycle analysis, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and western blotting in HCC cells, and HCC tissues from mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. We demonstrated that atorvastatin induced cell growth inhibition and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, leading to senescence in HCC cells. Atorvastatin-induced senescence was independent of p53, p14, and p16, and atorvastatin not only decreased the secretion of IL-6, a major senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor, and the phosphorylation of STAT3 but also inhibited the expression of hTERT, a catalytic subunit of telomerase. Supplementation with exogenous IL-6 reversed both atorvastatin-induced suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and hTERT expression and atorvastatin-induced senescence. Overexpression of constitutively activated STAT3 rescued HCC cells from atorvastatin-induced hTERT suppression and senescence. Moreover, atorvastatin decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Consistent with these results, atorvastatin decreased the IL-6, p-STAT3, and hTERT levels and increased β-gal expression in tumor sections. Taken together, these data indicate that atorvastatin can induce atypical cellular senescence in HCC cells to inhibit tumor growth, an effect mediated by downregulation of hTERT through suppression of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked neuromuscular disorder that affects males. However, 8% of female carriers are symptomatic and underrepresented in research due to the lack of animal models. We generated a symptomatic mouse model of DMD carriers via injection of mdx (murine DMD) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into wild-type (WT) blastocysts (mdx/WT chimera). mdx/WT chimeras developed cardiomyopathic features and dystrophic skeletal muscle phenotypes including elevated mononuclear invasion, central nucleation, fibrosis and declined forelimb grip strength. The disease was accompanied by connexin-43 (Cx43) aberrantly enhanced in both cardiac and skeletal muscles and remodeled in the heart. Genetic reduction of Cx43-copy number in mdx/WT-Cx43(+/−) chimeras protected them from both cardiac and skeletal muscle fiber damage. In dystrophic skeletal muscle, Cx43 expression was not seen in the fibers but in adjacent F4/80+ mononuclear cells. Ethidium Bromide uptake in purified F4/80+/CD11b+ mdx macrophages revealed functional activity of Cx43, which was inhibited by administration of Gap19 peptide mimetic, a Cx43 hemichannel-specific inhibitor. Thus, we suggest that Cx43 reduction in symptomatic DMD carrier mice leads to prevention of Cx43 remodeling in the heart and prevention of aberrant Cx43 hemichannel activity in the skeletal muscle macrophages neighboring Cx43 non-expressing fibers."
"The objective of this study was to estimate overall survival in children with extremity rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). In addition, we attempted to construct a nomogram to predict the prognosis in such patients using a population-based cohort. The national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was used to identify a cohort of childhood RMS patients. A total of 197 patients with RMS were ultimately included. Multivariable analysis identified age group, N classification, M classification, and treatment combinations as independent predictive factors for patient overall survival. Candidate variables such as age group, N classification, M classification, and treatment combinations were used to fit the model. For overall survival, the bootstrap-adjusted c-index was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73–0.80) for the nomogram. Furthermore, we performed recursive partitioning analysis for risk stratification according to overall survival, and 3 prognostic subgroups were generated (low, intermediate and high risk). Finally, we evaluated multimodal treatment based on the risk stratification according to the nomogram and IRSG prognostic stratification model. With regard to the entire cohort, overall survival in patients who received surgery and radiation was superior to that in patients who received surgery or radiation (p = 0.001). Regarding RPA and IRSG prognostic stratification, we found that the differences remained significant (p < 0.05) in patients with low-intermediate risk. However, the difference disappeared in patients with high risk (p > 0.05). We performed a population-based analysis of data from the SEER registry in an effort to identify prognostic factors and develop a nomogram in children with extremity RMS. The nomogram appears to be suitable for the survival stratification of children with RMS and will help clinicians identify patients who may be at a reduced probability of survival and assist them in making treatment and surveillance decisions. More studies concerning overall survival in children with RMS are needed to confirm and update our findings."
"Small molecule based targeted therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma hold promise but responses are often not durable, and tumors frequently relapse. Response to adoptive cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapy in melanoma patients are durable but patients develop resistance primarily due to loss of antigen expression. The combination of small molecules that sustain T cell effector function with ACT could lead to long lasting responses. Here, we have developed a novel co-culture cell-based high throughput assay system to identify compounds that could potentially synergize or enhance ACT-based immunotherapy of melanoma. A BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell line, SB-3123p which is resistant to Pmel-1-directed ACT due to low gp100 expression levels was used to develop a homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF), screening assay. This high throughput screening assay quantitates IFNγ released upon recognition of the SB-3123p melanoma cells by Pmel-1 CD8+ T-cells. A focused collection of approximately 500 small molecules targeting a broad range of cellular mechanisms was screened, and four active compounds that increased melanoma antigen expression leading to enhanced IFNγ production were identified and their in vitro activity was validated. These four compounds may provide a basis for enhanced immune recognition and design of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with BRAF mutant melanoma resistant to ACT due to antigen downregulation."
"The human germ-cell lineage originates as human primordial germ cells (hPGCs). hPGCs undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming and differentiate into oogonia or gonocytes, precursors for oocytes or spermatogonia, respectively. Here, we describe a protocol to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into oogonia in vitro. hiPSCs are induced into incipient mesoderm-like cells (iMeLCs) using activin A and a WNT pathway agonist. iMeLCs, or, alternatively, hPSCs cultured with divergent signaling inhibitors, are induced into hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) in floating aggregates by cytokines including bone morphogenic protein 4. hPGCLCs are aggregated with mouse embryonic ovarian somatic cells to form xenogeneic reconstituted ovaries, which are cultured under an air–liquid interface condition for ~4 months for hPGCLCs to differentiate into oogonia and immediate precursory states for oocytes. To date, this is the only approach that generates oogonia from hPGCLCs. The protocol is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of hPGC specification and epigenetic reprogramming."
"Minimal phenotyping refers to the reliance on the use of a small number of self-reported items for disease case identification, increasingly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report differences in genetic architecture between depression defined by minimal phenotyping and strictly defined major depressive disorder (MDD): the former has a lower genotype-derived heritability that cannot be explained by inclusion of milder cases and a higher proportion of the genome contributing to this shared genetic liability with other conditions than for strictly defined MDD. GWAS based on minimal phenotyping definitions preferentially identifies loci that are not specific to MDD, and, although it generates highly predictive polygenic risk scores, the predictive power can be explained entirely by large sample sizes rather than by specificity for MDD. Our results show that reliance on results from minimal phenotyping may bias views of the genetic architecture of MDD and impede the ability to identify pathways specific to MDD."
"The pool of beta cell-specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) sustains an autoreactive potential despite having access to a constant source of antigen. To investigate the long-lived nature of these cells, we established a DNA methylation-based T cell ‘multipotency index’ and found that beta cell-specific CD8+ T cells retained a stem-like epigenetic multipotency score. Single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing confirmed the coexistence of naive and effector-associated epigenetic programs in individual beta cell-specific CD8+ T cells. Assessment of beta cell-specific CD8+ T cell anatomical distribution and the establishment of stem-associated epigenetic programs revealed that self-reactive CD8+ T cells isolated from murine lymphoid tissue retained developmentally plastic phenotypic and epigenetic profiles relative to the same cells isolated from the pancreas. Collectively, these data provide new insight into the longevity of beta cell-specific CD8+ T cell responses and document the use of this methylation-based multipotency index for investigating human and mouse CD8+ T cell differentiation."
"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is becoming a cause of community-acquired diarrhea. The aim is to describe (CDI) as a cause of acute diarrhea in patients presenting from the community to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care center in Lebanon. A retrospective study conducted in the ED at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). Adult patients presenting with the chief complaint of diarrhea and having positive CDI by stool laboratory testing (toxins A and B), during a three-year period were included. 125 patients with CDI were included. Average age was 61.43 (±20.42) with roughly equal sex prevalence. 30% (n = 36) of patients had neither antibiotic exposure nor recent hospitalization prior to current CDI. Mortality was 9.6% (n = 12), CDI was attributed as the cause in 16.7% (n = 2) and a contributing factor in 41.6% (n = 5). Recurrence within 3 months occurred in 9.6% (n = 11) in mainly those taking Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and having multiple co-morbidities. There is a high rate of community acquired CDI in Lebanon. Review of patients’ medications (PPIs and antibiotics) is crucial. More studies are needed to assess mortality associated with CDI and the outcome of coinfection with other enteric pathogens."
"ObjectivesTo reassess the definition of a large macular hole, factors predicting hole closure and post-surgery visual recovery.DesignDatabase study of 1483 primary macular hole operations. Eligible operations were primary MH operations treated with a vitrectomy and a gas or air tamponade. Excluded were eyes with a history of retinal detachment, high myopia, previous vitrectomy or trauma.ResultsA higher proportion of operations were performed in eyes from females (71.1%) who were ‘on average’ younger (p < 0.001), with slightly larger holes (p < 0.001) than male patients. Sulfur hexafluoride gas was generally used for smaller holes (p < 0.001). From 1253 operations with a known surgical outcome, successful hole closure was achieved in 1199 (96%) and influenced by smaller holes and complete ILM peeling (p < 0.001), but not post-surgery positioning (p = 0.072). A minimum linear diameter of ~500 μm marked the threshold where the success rate started to decline. From the 1056 successfully closed operations eligible for visual outcome analysis, visual success (defined as visual acuity of 0.30 or better logMAR) was achieved in 488 (46.2%) eyes. At the multivariate level, the factors predicting visual success were better pre-operative VA, smaller hole size, shorter duration of symptoms and the absence of AMD.ConclusionsFemales undergoing primary macular hole surgery tend to be younger and have larger holes than male patients. The definition of a large hole should be changed to around 500 μm, and patients should be operated on early to help achieve a good post-operative VA."
"Serum concentrations of Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and Inhibin B were used to assess potential fertility in survivors of childhood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after three chemotherapy-conditioning regimens of differing intensity. Of 428 patients transplanted between 1990–2012 for leukaemia and immunodeficiency 121 surviving >1 year after a single HSCT were recruited. Group A had a treosulfan-based regimen (low-toxicity); Group B had fludarabine/melphalan (Flu-Mel) (reduced-intensity) and Group C had busulphan/cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy) (myelo-ablative). Mean age at HSCT and follow-up and length of follow-up were 3.6, 11.8 and 9.9 years. Mean AMH standard deviation scores (SDS) were significantly higher in Group A (−1.047) and Group B (−1.255) than Group C (−1.543), suggesting less ovarian reserve impairment after treosulfan and Flu-Mel than after Bu-Cy. Mean serum AMH concentration was significantly better with treosulfan (>1.0 μg/l) than with Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy. In males, mean Inhibin B SDS was significantly higher in Group A (−0.506) than in Group B (−2.53) and Group C (−1.23) with the Flu-Mel group suffering greatest impairment. In conclusion, a treosulfan-based regimen confers a more favourable outlook for gonadal reserve than Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy in both sexes. Higher values of Inhibin B after Bu-Cy than after Flu-Mel may reflect recovery over time."
"Recently, relationship between gut microbiota composition and development of obesity has been pointed. However, the gut microbiota composition of individual with obesity is not known yet. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to evaluate differences in profile of gut microbiota between individuals with obesity and individuals with normal weight. A search performed on August 2019 in the databases Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Lilacs and gray literature using the terms: “microbiota”, “microbiome”, “obesity”, “obesity morbid”, and “humans”. Studies assessing the gut microbiota composition in adults with obesity and lean were included. Quality assessment was performed by Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Of the 12,496 studies, 32 were eligible and included in this review. Individuals with obesity have a greater Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Mollicutes, Lactobacillus (reuteri), and less Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia muciniphila), Faecalibacterium (prausnitzii), Bacteroidetes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Lactobacillus plantarum and paracasei. In addition, some bacteria had positive correlation and others negative correlation with obesity. Individuals with obesity showed profile of gut microbiota different than individual lean. These results may help in advances of the diagnosis and treatment of obesity."
"Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders have identified numerous significant loci. Whereas these studies initially depended on cohorts ascertained for specific disorders, there has been a gradual shift in the ascertainment strategy toward population-based cohorts for which both genotype and heterogeneous phenotypic information are available. One of the advantages of population-based cohorts is that, in addition to clinical diagnoses and various proxies for diagnoses (‘minimal phenotyping’), many of them also provide non-clinical phenotypes, including putative endophenotypes, that can be used to study domains of normal function in addition to, or instead of, clinical diagnoses. By studying endophenotypes it is possible to both dissect psychiatric disorders (‘splitting’) and to combine multiple phenotypes (‘clumping’), which can either reinforce or challenge traditional diagnostic categories. Such endophenotypes may also permit a deeper exploration of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders. A coordinated effort to fully exploit the potential of endophenotypes is overdue."
"Interleukin (IL)-17A is a well-described mediator of bone resorption in inflammatory diseases, and postmenopausal osteoporosis is associated with increased serum levels of IL-17A. Ovariectomy (OVX) can be used as a model to study bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency and the role of IL-17A in osteoporosis development has previously been investigated using various methods to inhibit IL-17A signaling in this model. However, the studies show opposing results. While some publications reported IL-17A as a mediator of OVX-induced osteoporosis, others found a bone-protective role for IL-17 receptor signaling. In this study, we provide an explanation for the discrepancies in previous literature and show for the first time that loss of IL-17A has differential effects on OVX-induced osteoporosis; with IL-17A being important for cortical but not trabecular bone loss. Interestingly, the decrease in trabecular bone after OVX in IL-17A knock-out mice, was accompanied by increased adipogenesis depicted by elevated leptin levels. Additionally, the bone marrow adipose tissue expanded, and the bone-turnover decreased in ovariectomized mice lacking IL-17A compared to ovariectomized WT mice. Our results increase the understanding of how IL-17A signaling influences bone remodeling in the different bone compartments, which is of importance for the development of new treatments of post-menopausal osteoporosis."
"BackgroundData on the association of breakfast habits and changes in cardiometabolic markers in children are limited.MethodsIn total, 6964 children aged 6–13 years from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Jinan, Harbin, and Guangzhou were included in the final analysis. Daily consumption, consumption of ≥3 food groups, and at-home consumption were defined as healthy breakfast habits. Blood pressure, % fat mass, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, glucose, and 50-m × 8 shuttle run were measured at baseline (May 2009) and follow-up (May 2010). Clustered cardiometabolic risk score (CCRS) was computed by summing Z scores of five components: % fat mass, systolic blood pressure, glucose, TC to HDL-C ratio, and triglyceride.ResultsChildren who ate breakfast daily had a higher decrease in TC to HDL-C ratio and a higher increase in HDL-C compared with breakfast skippers (both P values < 0.05). There was an inverse association of the number of food groups consumed at breakfast with the change in CCRS (P trend = 0.005). At-home breakfast consumption was associated with a lower increase in BMI, LDL-C, TC to HDL-C ratio, fasting glucose, and 50-m × 8 shuttle run and a higher increase in HDL-C (all P values < 0.05). Children with two or three healthy breakfast habits had a lower increase in CCRS, LDL-C, TC to HDL-C ratio, glucose, and a higher increase in HDL-C compared with those with none or one (all P values < 0.05).ConclusionsHealthy breakfast habits might help minimize the cardiometabolic risk factors in children."
"A novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China since December 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world1–3. To better understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound to the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are critical for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1–3,5. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analysed with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future identification of cross-reactive antibodies."
"Mutations in the CDC14A (Cell Division-Cycle 14A) gene, which encodes a conserved dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase, have been identified as a cause of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB32) and hearing impairment infertility male syndrome (HIIMS). We used next-generation sequencing to screen six deaf probands from six families segregating sensorineural moderate-to-profound hearing loss. Data analysis and variant prioritization were completed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. We identified three homozygous loss of function variants (p.Arg345Ter, p.Arg376Ter, and p.Ala451Thrfs*43) in the CDC14A gene, segregating with deafness in each family. Of the six families, four segregated the p.Arg376Ter mutation, one family segregated the p.Arg345Ter mutation and one family segregated a novel frameshift (p.Ala451Thrfs*43) mutation. In-depth phenotyping of affected individuals ruled out secondary syndromic findings. This study implicates the p.Arg376Ter mutation might be as a founder mutation in the Iranian population. It also provides the first semen analysis for deaf males carrying mutations in exon 11 of CDC14A and reveals a genotype–phenotype correlation that delineates between DFNB32 and HIIMS. The clinical results from affected males suggest the NM_033313.2 transcript alone is sufficient for proper male fertility, but not for proper auditory function. We conclude that DFNB32 is a distinct phenotypic entity in males."
"Escaping programmed cell death is a hallmark of cancer. NF-κB transcription factors are key regulator of cell survival and aberrant NF-κB signaling has been involved in the pathogenesis of most human malignancies. Although NF-κB is best known for its antiapoptotic role, other processes regulating the life/death balance, such as autophagy and necroptosis, seem to network with NF-κB. This review discusses how the reciprocal regulation of NF-κB, autophagy and programmed cell death affect cancer development and progression."
"In vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into functional retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells provides a potentially unlimited source for cell based reparative therapy of age-related macular degeneration. Although the inherent pigmentation of the RPE cells have been useful to grossly evaluate differentiation efficiency and allowed manual isolation of pigmented structures, accurate quantification and automated isolation has been challenging. To address this issue, here we perform a comprehensive antibody screening and identify cell surface markers for RPE cells. We show that these markers can be used to isolate RPE cells during in vitro differentiation and to track, quantify and improve differentiation efficiency. Finally, these surface markers aided to develop a robust, direct and scalable monolayer differentiation protocol on human recombinant laminin-111 and −521 without the need for manual isolation."
"Discriminating between malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and benign pleural effusion (BPE) remains difficult. Thus, novel and efficient biomarkers are required for the diagnosis of pleural effusion (PE). The aim of this study was to validate calprotectin as a diagnostic biomarker of PE in clinical settings. A total of 425 patients were recruited, and the pleural fluid samples collected had BPE in 223 cases (53.7%) or MPE in 137 patients (33%). The samples were all analysed following the same previously validated clinical laboratory protocols and methodology. Calprotectin levels ranged from 772.48 to 3,163.8 ng/mL (median: 1,939 ng/mL) in MPE, and 3,216–24,000 ng/mL in BPE (median: 9,209 ng/mL; p < 0.01), with an area under the curve of 0.848 [95% CI: 0.810–0.886]. For a cut-off value of ≤ 6,233.2 ng/mL, we found 96% sensitivity and 60% specificity, with a negative and positive predictive value, and negative and positive likelihood ratios of 96%, 57%, 0.06, and 2.4, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that low calprotectin levels was a better discriminator of PE than any other variable [OR 28.76 (p < 0.0001)]. Our results confirm that calprotectin is a new and useful diagnostic biomarker in patients with PE of uncertain aetiology which has potential applications in clinical practice because it may be a good complement to cytological methods."
"Strategies for selectively imaging and delivering drugs to tumours typically leverage differentially upregulated surface molecules on cancer cells. Here, we show that intravenously injected carbon quantum dots, functionalized with multiple paired α-carboxyl and amino groups that bind to the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (which is expressed in most tumours), selectively accumulate in human tumour xenografts in mice and in an orthotopic mouse model of human glioma. The functionalized quantum dots, which structurally mimic large amino acids and can be loaded with aromatic drugs through π–π stacking interactions, enabled—in the absence of detectable toxicity—near-infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of the tumours and a reduction in tumour burden after the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumours. The versatility of functionalization and high tumour selectivity of the quantum dots make them broadly suitable for tumour-specific imaging and drug delivery."
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop when mechanisms for making accurate distinctions about threat relevance have gone awry. Generalization across conceptually related objects has been hypothesized based on clinical observation in PTSD, but the neural mechanisms remain unexplored. Recent trauma-exposed military veterans (n = 46) were grouped into PTSD (n = 23) and non-PTSD (n = 23). Participants learned to generalize fear across conceptual categories (animals or tools) of semantically related items that were partially reinforced by shock during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditioned fear learning was quantified by shock expectancy and skin conductance response (SCR). Relative to veteran controls, PTSD subjects exhibited a stronger neural response associated with fear generalization to the reinforced object category in the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, occipitotemporal cortex, and insula (Z > 2.3; p < 0.05; whole-brain corrected). Based on SCR, both groups generalized the shock contingency to the reinforced conceptual category, but learning was not significantly different between groups. We found that PTSD was associated with an enhanced neural response in fronto-limbic, midline, and occipitotemporal regions to a learned representation of threat that is based on previously established conceptual knowledge of the relationship between basic-level exemplars within a semantic category. Behaviorally, veterans with PTSD were somewhat slower to differentiate threat and safety categories as compared with trauma-exposed veteran controls owing in part to an initial overgeneralized behavioral response to the safe category. These results have implications for understanding how fear spreads across semantically related concepts in PTSD."
"During obesity, macrophages infiltrate the visceral adipose tissue and promote inflammation that contributes to type II diabetes. Evidence suggests that the rewiring of cellular metabolism can regulate macrophage function. However, the metabolic programs that characterize adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) in obesity are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that ATM from obese mice exhibit metabolic profiles characterized by elevated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, distinct from ATM from lean mice. Increased activation of HIF-1α in ATM of obese visceral adipose tissue resulted in induction of IL-1β and genes in the glycolytic pathway. Using a hypoxia-tracer, we show that HIF-1α nuclear translocation occurred both in hypoxic and non-hypoxic ATM suggesting that both hypoxic and pseudohypoxic stimuli activate HIF-1α and its target genes in ATM during diet-induced obesity. Exposure of macrophages to the saturated fatty acid palmitate increased glycolysis and HIF-1α expression, which culminated in IL-1β induction thereby simulating pseudohypoxia. Using mice with macrophage-specific targeted deletion of HIF-1α, we demonstrate the critical role of HIF-1α-derived from macrophages in regulating ATM accumulation, and local and systemic IL-1β production, but not in modulating systemic metabolic responses. Collectively, our data identify enhanced glycolysis and HIF-1α activation as drivers of low-grade inflammation in obesity."
"3′-Sialyllactose (3′-SL), a natural prebiotic, maintains immune homeostasis and exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects. Although regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent excessive inflammation and maintain immune tolerance, the effect of 3′-SL on Treg regulation is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 3′-SL on Treg responses in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Oral administration of 3′-SL reduced AD-like symptoms such as ear, epidermal, and dermal thickness in repeated topical application of house dust mites (HDM) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). 3′-SL inhibited IgE, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion and markedly downregulated AD-related cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and Tslp through regulation of NF-κB in ear tissue. Additionally, in vitro assessment of Treg differentiation revealed that 3′-SL directly induced TGF-β-mediated Treg differentiation. Furthermore, 3′-SL administration also ameliorated sensitization and elicitation of AD pathogenesis by suppressing mast cell infiltration and production of IgE and pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum by mediating the Treg response. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium population was also increased by 3′-SL administration as prebiotics. Our data collectively show that 3′-SL has therapeutic effects against AD progression by inducing Treg differentiation, downregulating AD-related cytokines, and increasing the Bifidobacterium population."
"Diabetic macular edema (DME) and retina vein occlusion (RVO) are macular diseases in which central photoreceptors are affected due to pathological accumulation of fluid. Optical coherence tomography allows to visually assess and evaluate photoreceptor integrity, whose alteration has been observed as an important biomarker of both diseases. However, the manual quantification of this layered structure is challenging, tedious and time-consuming. In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach for automatically segmenting and characterising photoreceptor alteration. The photoreceptor layer is segmented using an ensemble of four different convolutional neural networks. En-face representations of the layer thickness are produced to characterize the photoreceptors. The pixel-wise standard deviation of the score maps produced by the individual models is also taken to indicate areas of photoreceptor abnormality or ambiguous results. Experimental results showed that our ensemble is able to produce results in pair with a human expert, outperforming each of its constitutive models. No statistically significant differences were observed between mean thickness estimates obtained from automated and manually generated annotations. Therefore, our model is able to reliable quantify photoreceptors, which can be used to improve prognosis and managment of macular diseases."
"African populations are underrepresented in medical genomics studies. For the Somali population, there is virtually no information on genomic markers with significance to precision medicine. Here, we analyzed nearly 900,000 genomic markers in samples collected from 95 unrelated individuals in the North Eastern Somalia. ADMIXTURE program for estimation of individual ancestries revealed a homogenous Somali population. Principal component analysis with PLINK software showed approximately 60% East African and 40% West Eurasian genes in the Somali population, with a close relation to the Cushitic and Semitic speaking Ethiopian populations. We report the unique features of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in the Somali population, which seem to differentiate from all other neighboring regions compared. Current study identified high prevalence of the diabetes type 1 (T1D) predisposing HLA DR-DQ haplotypes in Somalia. This finding may explain the increased T1D risk observed among Somali children. In addition, ethnic Somalis were found to host the highest frequencies observed thus far for several pharmacogenetic variants, including UGT1A4*2. In conclusion, we report that the Somali population displays genetic traits of significance to health and disease. The Somali dataset is publicly available and will add more information to the few genomic datasets available for African populations."
"The solid and fluid pressures of tumours are often elevated relative to surrounding tissue. This increased pressure is known to correlate with decreased treatment efficacy and potentially with tumour aggressiveness and therefore, accurate noninvasive estimates of tumour pressure would be of great value. We present a proof-of-concept method to infer the total tumour pressure, that is the sum of the fluid and solid parts, by examining stiffness in the peritumoural tissue with MR elastography and utilising nonlinear biomechanical models. The pressure from the tumour deforms the surrounding tissue leading to changes in stiffness. Understanding and accounting for these biases in stiffness has the potential to enable estimation of total tumour pressure. Simulations are used to validate the method with varying pressure levels, tumour shape, tumour size, and noise levels. Results show excellent matching in low noise cases and still correlate well with higher noise. Percent error remains near or below 10% for higher pressures in all noise level cases. Reconstructed pressures were also calculated from experiments with a catheter balloon embedded in a plastisol phantom at multiple inflation levels. Here the reconstructed pressures generally match the increases in pressure measured during the experiments. Percent errors between average reconstructed and measured pressures at four inflation states are 17.9%, 52%, 23.2%, and 0.9%. Future work will apply this method to in vivo data, potentially providing an important biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment."
"Docetaxel (DTX) was loaded in nanoliposomes based on a new remote loading method using mannitol and acetic acid as hydration buffer. DTX loading conditions were optimized, and the final formulations were prepared according to the best parameters which were HSPC/mPEG2000-DSPE/Chol (F1), HSPC/mPEG2000-DSPE/DPPG/Chol (F2), HSPC/mPEG2000-DSPE/DSPG/Chol (F3), at molar ratios of 85/5/10, 80/5/5/10, 80/5/5/10, respectively. DTX-liposomes were found of desired size (~115 nm) and homogeneity (PDI ≤ 0.2), high drug encapsulation efficacy (34–67%) and DTX concentration, and favorable stability. Passive loaded counterparts liposomes showed three times lower encapsulation efficacy compared to the remote loaded liposomes. The drug release of remote loaded liposomes in plasma 50% was significantly more controlled and less in comparison with their passive loaded counterparts (p < 0.0001). The IC50 values of formulations were determined on MCF-7, 4T1, TUBO, NIH/3T3 cell lines. The biodistribution of iodinated docetaxel as free or liposomal form exhibited significantly greater accumulation of DTX-liposomes in tumors than that of free docetaxel due to the EPR effect. In vivo experiment with BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 or TUBO breast carcinoma tumors also showed that DTX-liposomes could significantly delay tumor growth and prolonged the survival time in comparison with control and Taxotere groups at the similar dose of 8 mg/kg. F1 and F2 formulations were stable and showed good anti-tumor activity and merit further investigation."
"There is distinct pathogenesis between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor for glaucoma, non-IOP risk factors such as vascular abnormalities and lower systolic/diastolic perfusion pressure may play a role in the pathogenic process. This study aimed to compare the vessel density (VD) in the optic disc and macula using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) between POAG and PACG eyes. Thirty-two POAG eyes, 30 PACG eyes, and 39 control eyes were included. All the optic disc VD parameters except the inside disc VD were significantly lower in glaucomatous eyes than in control eyes. Compared with PACG eyes, only the inferior temporal peripapillary VD was significantly lower in POAG eyes. The parafoveal VD was significantly lower in each quadrant in glaucomatous eyes than in control eyes. The central macular and parafoveal VD did not differ between POAG and PACG eyes. In conclusion, the inferior temporal peripapillary VD was significantly reduced in POAG eyes compared with PACG eyes, while PACG eyes showed a more evenly distributed reduction in the peripapillary VD. The distinct patterns of VD change may be associated with the different pathogenesis between POAG and PACG."
"Activation of acid sphingomyelinase (SMPD1) and the generation of ceramide is a critical regulator of apoptosis in response to cellular stress including radiation. Endothelial SMPD1 has been shown to regulate tumor responses to radiation therapy. We show here that the SMPD1 gene is regulated by a microRNA (miR), miR-15a, in endothelial cells (ECs). Standard low dose radiation (2 Gy) upregulates miR-15a and decreases SMPD1 levels. In contrast, high dose radiation (10 Gy and above) decreases miR-15a and increases SMPD1. Ectopic expression of miR-15a decreases both mRNA and protein levels of SMPD1. Mimicking the effects of high dose radiation with a miR-15a inhibitor decreases cell proliferation and increases active Caspase-3 & 7. Mechanistically, inhibition of miR-15a increases inflammatory cytokines, activates caspase-1 inflammasome and increases Gasdermin D, an effector of pyroptosis. Importantly, both systemic and vascular-targeted delivery of miR-15a inhibitor decreases angiogenesis and tumor growth in a CT26 murine colorectal carcinoma model. Taken together, our findings highlight a novel role for miR mediated regulation of SMPD1 during radiation responses and establish proof-of-concept that this pathway can be targeted with a miR inhibitor."
"ADAR RNA editing enzymes are high-affinity dsRNA-binding proteins that deaminate adenosines to inosines in pre-mRNA hairpins and also exert editing-independent effects. We generated a Drosophila AdarE374A mutant strain encoding a catalytically inactive Adar with CRISPR/Cas9. We demonstrate that Adar adenosine deamination activity is necessary for normal locomotion and prevents age-dependent neurodegeneration. The catalytically inactive protein, when expressed at a higher than physiological level, can rescue neurodegeneration in Adar mutants, suggesting also editing-independent effects. Furthermore, loss of Adar RNA editing activity leads to innate immune induction, indicating that Drosophila Adar, despite being the homolog of mammalian ADAR2, also has functions similar to mammalian ADAR1. The innate immune induction in fly Adar mutants is suppressed by silencing of Dicer-2, which has a RNA helicase domain similar to MDA5 that senses unedited dsRNAs in mammalian Adar1 mutants. Our work demonstrates that the single Adar enzyme in Drosophila unexpectedly has dual functions."
"Metabolic images from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are used routinely for diagnosis, follow-up or treatment planning purposes of cancer patients. In this study we aimed at determining if radiomic features extracted from 18F-Fluoro Deoxy Glucose (FDG) PET images could mirror tumor transcriptomics. In this study we analyzed 45 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (H&N) that underwent FDG-PET scans at the time of diagnosis and transcriptome analysis using RNAs from both cancer and healthy tissues on microarrays. Association between PET radiomics and transcriptomics was carried out with the Genomica software and a functional annotation was used to associate PET radiomics, gene expression and altered biological pathways. We identified relationships between PET radiomics and genes involved in cell-cycle, disease, DNA repair, extracellular matrix organization, immune system, metabolism or signal transduction pathways, according to the Reactome classification. Our results suggest that these FDG PET radiomic features could be used to infer tissue gene expression and cellular pathway activity in H&N cancers. These observations strengthen the value of radiomics as a promising approach to personalize treatments through targeting tumor-specific molecular processes."
"Avocado (Persea americana Mill.; Lauraceae) seed-derived polyhydroxylated fatty alcohols (PFAs) or polyols (i.e., avocadene and avocadyne) are metabolic modulators that selectively induce apoptosis of leukemia stem cells and reverse pathologies associated with diet-induced obesity. Delivery systems containing avocado polyols have not been described. Herein, natural surface active properties of these polyols are characterized and incorporated into self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) that rely on molecular self-assembly to form fine, transparent, oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsions as small as 20 nanometers in diameter. Mechanistically, a 1:1 molar ratio of avocadene and avocadyne (i.e., avocatin B or AVO was shown to be a eutectic mixture which can be employed as a novel, bioactive, co-surfactant that significantly reduces droplet size of medium-chain triglyceride O/W emulsions stabilized with polysorbate 80. In vitro cytotoxicity of avocado polyol-SEDDS in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines indicated significant increases in potency and bioactivity compared to conventional cell culture delivery systems. A pilot pharmacokinetic evaluation of AVO SEDDS in C57BL/6J mice revealed appreciable accumulation in whole blood and biodistribution in key target tissues. Lastly, incorporation of AVO in SEDDS significantly improved encapsulation of the poorly water-soluble drugs naproxen and curcumin."
"Metabolic hormones stabilize brain reward and motivational circuits, whereas excessive opioid consumption counteracts this effect and may impair metabolic function. Here we addressed the role of metabolic processes in the course of the agonist medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine or methadone. Plasma lipids, hemoglobin A1C, body composition, the oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and the Sweet Taste Test (STT) were measured in buprenorphine- (n = 26) or methadone (n = 32)- treated subjects with OUD. On the whole, the subjects in both groups were overweight or obese and insulin resistant; they displayed similar oGTT and STT performance. As compared to methadone-treated subjects, those on buprenorphine had significantly lower rates of metabolic syndrome (MetS) along with better values of the high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Subjects with- vs. without MetS tended to have greater addiction severity. Correlative analyses revealed that more buprenorphine exposure duration was associated with better HDL and opioid craving values. In contrast, more methadone exposure duration was associated with worse triglycerides-, HDL-, blood pressure-, fasting glucose- and hemoglobin A1C values. Buprenorphine appears to produce beneficial HDL- and craving effects and, contrary to methadone, its role in the metabolic derangements is not obvious. Our data call for further research aimed at understanding the distinctive features of buprenorphine metabolic effects vis-à-vis those of methadone and their potential role in these drugs’ unique therapeutic profiles."
"Gpr27 is a highly conserved, orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) previously implicated in pancreatic beta cell insulin transcription and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. Here, we characterize a whole-body mouse knockout of Gpr27. Gpr27 knockout mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios and exhibited no gross abnormalities. Insulin and Pdx1 mRNA in Gpr27 knockout islets were reduced by 30%, but this did not translate to a reduction in islet insulin content or beta cell mass. Gpr27 knockout mice exhibited slightly worsened glucose tolerance with lower plasma insulin levels while maintaining similar insulin tolerance. Unexpectedly, Gpr27 deletion reduced expression of Eif4e3, a neighboring gene, likely by deleting transcription start sites on the anti-sense strand of the Gpr27 coding exon. Our data confirm that loss of Gpr27 reduces insulin mRNA in vivo but has only minor effects on glucose tolerance."
"Minimally invasive treatment of vascular disease demands dynamic navigation through complex blood vessel pathways and accurate placement of an interventional device, which has resulted in increased reliance on fluoroscopic guidance and commensurate radiation exposure to the patient and staff. Here we introduce a guidance system inspired by electric fish that incorporates measurements from a newly designed electrogenic sensory catheter with preoperative imaging to provide continuous feedback to guide vascular procedures without additional contrast injection, radiation, image registration, or external tracking. Electrodes near the catheter tip simultaneously create a weak electric field and measure the impedance, which changes with the internal geometry of the vessel as the catheter advances through the vasculature. The impedance time series is then mapped to a preoperative vessel model to determine the relative position of the catheter within the vessel tree. We present navigation in a synthetic vessel tree based on our mapping technique. Experiments in a porcine model demonstrated the sensor’s ability to detect cross-sectional area variation in vivo. These initial results demonstrate the capability and potential of this novel bioimpedance-based navigation technology as a non-fluoroscopic technique to augment existing imaging methods."
"The extracellular matrix plays an important role in cellular balance, and collagen fibers are its most important component. Over the last few years, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy has been used for the analysis of collagen fibers in several types of gynaecological cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. The value of collagen parameters obtained with this technique to gain insights on the physiopathology and on the prognostic evaluation of cancer has been advocated. Herein, we have characterized the collagen fibers in squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) and preneoplastic lesions using the SHG microscopy. Collagen parameters, quantity, organization, and uniformity, of VSCC, adjacent skin of VSCC or preneoplastic lesions were compared with values obtained in normal tissue of healthy control. There was an evident decrease in the values of collagen fiber parameters in the VSCC. Increased quantity and uniformity of tumor associated collagen fibers were associated with the presence of lymph node metastases, which suggest a prognostic value of such parameters in the evaluation of vulvar cancer."
"Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002–2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients’ sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2."
"Anaesthetics used during cancer surgery may influence tumour cells and immunological response. The aim of this study was to evaluate a potential influence of the anaesthetic method (inhaled anaesthetics versus total-intravenous anaesthesia using propofol) on recurrence-free and overall survival in glioblastoma patients. We retrospectively identified patients undergoing resection of contrast enhancing glioblastoma under general anaesthesia followed by standard adjuvant treatment between January 2010 and February 2017 at two University Hospitals. Matched pairs of patients receiving either balanced with volatile anaesthetics or total intravenous anaesthesia were generated according to the known prognostic factors (extent of resection, methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, age, Karnofsky performance score). Groups were compared using chi-square and Whitney-Man-U test. Time to recurrence was calculated using Kaplan Meier estimates. Log Rank test was used to assess the influence of the anaesthetic method. One hundred and fifty-eight (79:79) patients were included. Groups showed no significant difference in recurrence-free (volatiles: 8.0 (95% CI 6.5–9.8) vs. propofol: 8.4 (95% CI 7.9–10.1) months; p = 0.54) or overall survival (propofol: 17.4 (95% CI 14.0–20.7) vs. volatiles: 16.9 (95% CI 13.9–20.1) months; p = 0.85). In contrast to potential beneficial effects in some other solid tumours, the choice of anaesthetic method had no impact on survival in patients with glioblastoma in a well-defined cohort."
"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) in predicting overall survival for patients with hepatitis B- and hepatitis C-related early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (ESHCC) after liver resection. Post-operative survival rates were compared according to WFA+-M2BP level and tumor stage. Six hundred and ten patients were identified and 198 were removed after application of the exclusion criteria; the median follow-up time was 4.33 years, and cancer-related death occurred in 117 (28.4%) patients. Age (p = 0.03), fibrosis grade (p = 0.042), cancer stage (p = 0.01), and WFA+-M2BP level (p = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for poor overall survival. The overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years for patients with WFA+-M2BP ≤ 1.12 were 0.92 and 0.90, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.61 for patients with WFA+-M2BP > 1.12 (p < 0.001). During the analysis of survival prediction, serum WFA+-M2BP level exhibited a higher log-likelihood and a lower AIC value compared to TNM stage (log likelihood: −638; AIC: 1279). Pre-operative serum WFA+-M2BP level provided important prognostic information after curative hepatic resection in our study."
"The inner clock of biological organisms plays a pivotal role and has strong effects on metabolic processes such as glucose consumption. Since the commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-flourodeoxygucose (FDG) is a glucose analogue, it is not surprising that the FDG distribution in mice and humans has been shown to succumb to daily rhythms. In preclinical studies, the circadian rhythm of animals is often not considered, and studies are performed at different times of day. Only a few studies have analyzed the effect of the circadian rhythm on FDG uptake in mice, and none of these studies included human tumor xenografts. Therefore, it is not known how strongly a preclinical tumor study is influenced by the time of day. In this work, the effect of the circadian rhythm on FDG uptake in human tumor xenografts and other organs was analyzed. CD1 nu/nu mice were kept for three weeks under a 12 h light/12 h dark rhythm and then injected s.c. with PC3 or A431 tumor cells. When the tumors had reached an appropriate volume, FDG-PET scans were performed on different animal groups (n = 4–5) every 4 h over a time period from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. Tracer uptake in the tumors and in other organs was determined based on the PET scans and biodistribution studies. The standardized uptake value and %injected dose/cc of the tumors remained constant over the whole observed time period, and no statistically significant differences were determined according to the PET analysis. In the brain, we found a small but statistically significant increase from noon to 4 P.M., which led to a decrease in the tumor-to-brain ratio. No evidence for an effect of the circadian rhythm on FDG uptake could be found in subcutaneous tumors, however, in brain studies the circadian rhythm needs to be considered."
"Human sperm protein associated with the nucleus on the X chromosome (SPANX) genes encode a protein family (SPANX-A, -B, -C and -D), whose expression is limited to the testis and spermatozoa in normal tissues and to a wide variety of tumour cells. Present only in hominids, SPANX-A/D is exclusively expressed in post-meiotic spermatids and mature spermatozoa. However, the biological role of the protein family in human spermatozoa is largely unknown. Combining proteomics and molecular approaches, the present work describes the presence of all isoforms of SPANX-A/D in human spermatozoa and novel phosphorylation sites of this protein family. In addition, we identify 307 potential SPANX-A/D interactors related to nuclear envelop, chromatin organisation, metabolism and cilia movement. Specifically, SPANX-A/D interacts with fumarate hydratase and colocalises with both fumarate hydratase and Tektin 1 proteins, involved in meeting energy demands for sperm motility, and with nuclear pore complex nucleoporins. We provide insights into the molecular features of sperm physiology describing for the first time a multifunctional role of SPANX-A/D protein family in nuclear envelope, sperm movement and metabolism, considered key functions for human spermatozoa. SPANX-A/D family members, therefore, might be promising targets for sperm fertility management."
"Breakthroughs in the development of high-throughput technologies for profiling transcriptomes at the single-cell level have helped biologists to understand the heterogeneity of cell populations, disease states and developmental lineages. However, these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies generate an extraordinary amount of data, which creates analysis and interpretation challenges. Additionally, scRNA-seq datasets often contain technical sources of noise owing to incomplete RNA capture, PCR amplification biases and/or batch effects specific to the patient or sample. If not addressed, this technical noise can bias the analysis and interpretation of the data. In response to these challenges, a suite of computational tools has been developed to process, analyse and visualize scRNA-seq datasets. Although the specific steps of any given scRNA-seq analysis might differ depending on the biological questions being asked, a core workflow is used in most analyses. Typically, raw sequencing reads are processed into a gene expression matrix that is then normalized and scaled to remove technical noise. Next, cells are grouped according to similarities in their patterns of gene expression, which can be summarized in two or three dimensions for visualization on a scatterplot. These data can then be further analysed to provide an in-depth view of the cell types or developmental trajectories in the sample of interest."
"Systemic inflammation, reflected by increased plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, but its relevance for stroke types remains unclear. Moreover, evidence is limited in non-European populations. We investigated associations of CRP and fibrinogen with risks of incident major coronary events (MCE), ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in a cohort of Chinese adults. A nested case-control study within the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank included 1,508 incident MCE cases, 5,418 IS cases, 4,476 ICH cases, and 5,285 common controls, aged 30–79 years. High-sensitivity CRP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured in baseline plasma samples from all participants, and fibrinogen in a subset (n = 9,380). Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) per SD higher usual levels of log-transformed CRP and fibrinogen. The overall mean (SD) baseline LDL-C was 91.6 mg/dL (24.0) and geometric mean (95% CI) CRP and fibrinogen were 0.90 mg/L (0.87–0.93) and 3.01 g/L (2.98–3.03), respectively. There were approximately log-linear positive associations of CRP with each outcome, which persisted after adjustment for LDL-C and other risk factors, with adjusted ORs (95% CI) per SD higher CRP of 1.67 (1.44–1.94) for MCE and 1.22 (1.10–1.36) for both IS and ICH. No associations of fibrinogen with MCE, IS, or ICH were identified. Adding CRP to prediction models based on established risk factors improved model fit for each of MCE, IS, and ICH, with small improvements in C-statistic and correct reclassification of controls to lower risk groups. Among Chinese adults, who have low mean LDL-C, CRP, but not fibrinogen, was independently associated with increased risks of MCE and stroke."
"Stroke networks facilitate access to endovascular treatment (EVT) for patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. In this study we aimed to determine the safety of inter-hospital transfer and included all patients with acute ischemic stroke who were transferred within our stroke network for evaluation of EVT between 06/2016 and 12/2018. Data were derived from our prospective EVT database and transfer protocols. We analyzed major complications and medical interventions associated with inter-hospital transfer. Among 615 transferred patients, 377 patients (61.3%) were transferred within our telestroke network and had transfer protocols available (median age 76 years [interquartile range, IQR 17], 190 [50.4%] male, median baseline NIHSS score 17 [IQR 8], 246 [65.3%] drip-and-ship i.v.-thrombolysis). No patient suffered from cardio-respiratory failure or required emergency intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the transfer. Among 343 patients who were not intubated prior departure, 35 patients (10.2%) required medical interventions during the transfer. The performance of medical interventions was associated with a lower EVT rate and higher mortality at three months. In conclusion, the transfer of acute stroke patients for evaluation of EVT was not associated with major complications and transfer-related medical interventions were required in a minority of patients."
"Automated patch clamp (APC) instruments enable efficient evaluation of electrophysiologic effects of drugs on human cardiac currents in heterologous expression systems. Differences in experimental protocols, instruments, and dissimilar site procedures affect the variability of IC50 values characterizing drug block potency. This impacts the utility of APC platforms for assessing a drug’s cardiac safety margin. We determined variability of APC data from multiple sites that measured blocking potency of 12 blinded drugs (with different levels of proarrhythmic risk) against four human cardiac currents (hERG [IKr], hCav1.2 [L-Type ICa], peak hNav1.5, [Peak INa], late hNav1.5 [Late INa]) with recommended protocols (to minimize variance) using five APC platforms across 17 sites. IC50 variability (25/75 percentiles) differed for drugs and currents (e.g., 10.4-fold for dofetilide block of hERG current and 4-fold for mexiletine block of hNav1.5 current). Within-platform variance predominated for 4 of 12 hERG blocking drugs and 4 of 6 hNav1.5 blocking drugs. hERG and hNav1.5 block. Bland-Altman plots depicted varying agreement across APC platforms. A follow-up survey suggested multiple sources of experimental variability that could be further minimized by stricter adherence to standard protocols. Adoption of best practices would ensure less variable APC datasets and improved safety margins and proarrhythmic risk assessments."
"During mammalian development, establishing functional neural networks in stratified tissues of the mammalian central nervous system depends upon the proper migration and positioning of neurons, a process known as lamination. In particular, the pseudostratified neuroepithelia of the retina and cerebrocortical ventricular zones provide a platform for progenitor cell proliferation and migration. Lamination defects in these tissues lead to mispositioned neurons, disrupted neuronal connections, and abnormal function. The molecular mechanisms necessary for proper lamination in these tissues are incompletely understood. Here, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Eml1 gene in a novel murine model, tvrm360, displaying subcortical heterotopia, hydrocephalus and disorganization of retinal architecture. In the retina, Eml1 disruption caused abnormal positioning of photoreceptor cell nuclei early in development. Upon maturation, these ectopic photoreceptors possessed cilia and formed synapses but failed to produce robust outer segments, implying a late defect in photoreceptor differentiation secondary to mislocalization. In addition, abnormal positioning of Müller cell bodies and bipolar cells was evident throughout the inner neuroblastic layer. Basal displacement of mitotic nuclei in the retinal neuroepithelium was observed in tvrm360 mice at postnatal day 0. The abnormal positioning of retinal progenitor cells at birth and ectopic presence of photoreceptors and secondary neurons upon maturation suggest that EML1 functions early in eye development and is crucial for proper retinal lamination during cellular proliferation and development."
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are known risk factors for mortality. In this study, we examined the overlap of CKD and airflow limitation (AFL) that characterises COPD and its effect on 10-year mortality in a community-based population. This study included 1,233 health check-up participants (mean age, 63.7 years; 46.7% men). We defined serum creatinine-based CKD (CKDcr) and serum cystatin C-based CKD (CKDcys) as glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, estimated using serum creatinine or cystatin C, and/or dipstick proteinuria ≥1+. AFL was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio <70% on spirometry. Compared with subjects without AFL, those with AFL showed a significantly higher prevalence of CKDcys but not of CKDcr. Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for confounders showed that the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality was 1.45 (0.77–2.63) in subjects with CKDcys alone, 1.29 (0.60–2.54) in those with AFL alone, and 2.94 (1.33–6.12) in those with both CKDcys and AFL, with subjects without both AFL and CKD as the reference. This study showed that AFL and CKDcys are strongly associated and that their overlap is a significant risk factor for mortality in community-based populations."
"Most studies focusing on only one directional effect among cognitive health, physical function, and incontinence may miss potential paths. This study aimed to determine the pathway by analyzing the bidirectional effects of exposure (X) on outcome (Y) and explore the mediating effect (M) between X and Y. Secondary data analyses were performed in this study. The original data were collected from August to October 2013 in one VH in Tainan, Taiwan, and the final sample size was 144 older male veterans. Path analysis was performed to test the pathway sequence X → M → Y among the three outcome variables. Approximately 80% of the veterans were aged 81 or older, approximately 42% had a functional disability, 26% had cognitive impairment, and 20% had incontinence. The relationships between functional disability and incontinence and between functional disability and cognition impairment were bidirectional, and functional disability played a key mediating role in the relationship between cognitive impairment and incontinence. Physical more than cognitive training in order to improve or at least stabilize functional performance could be a way to prevent or reduce the process of developing incontinence."
"Despite being relatively rare, anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is a leading cause of acute liver failure and a major reason for treatment discontinuation, because of no specific and selective markers for ATDILI. Herein, this study aimed to investigate whether telomere length, a biological indicator of age-related diseases, is associated with ATDILI outcomes and could serve as an early ATDILI biomarker. Relative telomere length (RTL) in blood leukocyte of 100 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, 49 tuberculosis patients with ATDILI, and 53 tuberculosis patients with non-ATDILI was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both tuberculosis patients with and without ATDILI had significantly shorter RTL than healthy controls. Compared with tuberculosis patients with non-ATDILI, RTL in those with ATDILI was significantly increased. Longer RTL was found to be significantly associated with increased susceptibility to ATDILI. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that an increment in RTL was independently correlated with elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase assessed within 60 days after anti-tuberculosis treatment. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that longer RTL was associated with elevated rates of hepatotoxicity in tuberculosis patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis unveiled a diagnostic accuracy of RTL as a novel indicator for ATDILI progression (AUC = 0.73), which yielded more sensitive and specific values than traditional liver biomarkers including serum enzyme activities of aminotransferases measured within 7 days after treatment with anti-tuberculosis regimens. Collectively, aberrant RTL in blood leukocyte would reflect hepatotoxicity induced by anti-tuberculosis agents and might have a potential biomarker for early ATDILI progression."
"Lipid metabolic reprogramming plays an essential role in regulating the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) metabolism on CRC development is incompletely characterized. Here, we compared the mRNA levels of human CRC tissues to those of paracarcinoma tissues and focused on the notably enriched LPA metabolic pathways. We identified and verified that 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 4 (Agpat4) was aberrantly expressed in CRC tissues and predicted poor survival in CRC patients. Manipulating Agpat4 expression in CRC cells did not affect the growth or migration of CRC cells in vitro, whereas Agpat4 silencing suppressed CRC cell growth in subcutaneous and peritoneal xenograft models. Mechanistically, Agpat4 silencing-induced LPA release from CRC cells and polarized macrophages to an M1-like phenotype through LPA receptors 1 and 3. This M1 activation, characterized by elevated p38/p65 signaling and increased proinflammatory cytokines, promoted the infiltration and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Modulation of the Agpat4/LPA/p38/p65 axis regulated macrophage polarization, T-cell activity and CRC progression. Notably, combined therapy with LPA and regular chemotherapy drugs synergistically suppressed CRC development. Taken together, our results showed that the Agpat4/LPA axis in CRC cells regulated p38/p65 signaling-dependent macrophage polarization, T-cell activation, and CRC progression. The Agpat4/LPA/p38/p65 axis might represent a potential target for therapy in the clinic."
"Lysosomal dysfunction has been associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the activity of lysosomal enzymes is heterogeneously observed in PD. We investigated whether arylsulfatase A (ARSA) level can be used as a fluid biomarker of PD and can reflect disease progression. Plasma ARSA level was measured in 55 patients with early and drug-naïve PD, 13 patients with late PD, and 14 healthy controls. We compared the plasma ARSA level among the groups and assessed its correlation to clinical parameters and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. Plasma ARSA level was not correlated with age. The early PD group had higher plasma ARSA level than the control and late PD groups. In a generalized additive model including all patients with PD, the plasma ARSA level showed an inverted U-shape according to disease duration, peaking at 2.19 years. In patients with early PD, plasma ARSA level was positively correlated to parkinsonian motor score and negatively to striatal DAT activity. In summary, plasma ARSA level was elevated in early stage of PD, and elevated plasma ARSA level was correlated to the clinical and imaging markers of nigrostriatal degeneration. These results suggest that ARSA level is a potential biomarker of compensation in early PD."
"We aimed to investigate the prevalence of true rectocele and obstructed defecation (OD) in patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP), to investigate the correlation between true rectocele and OD, and to understand the diagnostic value of translabial ultrasound (TLUS) in the diagnosis of true rectocele. The patients who scheduled for POP surgery were enrolled in this study. Patients who had previous reconstructive pelvic surgery or repair of rectocele were excluded. Birmingham Bowel and Urinary symptoms questionnaires and Longo’s obstructed defecation syndrome scoring system were used to assess the bowel symptoms of patients. TLUS was used to evaluate anatomical defects. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and confidence intervals were set at 95%. 279 patients were included into this study. The prevalence rate of OD was 43%, and the average value of ODS score was 6.67. 17% patients presented straining at stool, 33% presented incomplete emptying, 13% presented digitations, and 12% required laxatives or enema. The prevalence rate of true rectocele was 23%. Defecation symptoms were significantly correlated with age, levator-ani hiatus, levator-ani muscle injury and true rectocele. Logistic regression showed that true rectocele and increased levator-ani hiatus were independent risk factors of OD. True rectocele was significantly correlated with straining at stool, digitation, incomplete emptying and requirement of laxatives or enema.In POP patients, the prevalence rate of true rectocele and OD was 23% and 43%, respectively. True rectocele was related to OD. TLUS was a valuable approach in anatomical evaluation of POP."
"Low intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a promising method of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses mechanical energy to affect neuronal excitability. LIFU confers high spatial resolution and adjustable focal lengths for precise neuromodulation of discrete regions in the human brain. Before the full potential of low intensity ultrasound for research and clinical application can be investigated, data on the safety of this technique is indicated. Here, we provide an evaluation of the safety of LIFU for human neuromodulation through participant report and neurological assessment with a comparison of symptomology to other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation. Participants (N = 120) that were enrolled in one of seven human ultrasound neuromodulation studies in one laboratory at the University of Minnesota (2015–2017) were queried to complete a follow-up Participant Report of Symptoms questionnaire assessing their self-reported experience and tolerance to participation in LIFU research (Isppa 11.56–17.12 W/cm2) and the perceived relation of symptoms to LIFU. A total of 64/120 participant (53%) responded to follow-up requests to complete the Participant Report of Symptoms questionnaire. None of the participants experienced serious adverse effects. From the post-hoc assessment of safety using the questionnaire, 7/64 reported mild to moderate symptoms, that were perceived as ‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related to participation in LIFU experiments. These reports included neck pain, problems with attention, muscle twitches and anxiety. The most common unrelated symptoms included sleepiness and neck pain. There were initial transient reports of mild neck pain, scalp tingling and headache that were extinguished upon follow-up. No new symptoms were reported upon follow up out to 1 month. The profile and incidence of symptoms looks to be similar to other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation."
"Little is known about the potential population-level impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among cisgender male sex workers (MSWs), a high-risk subset of cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM). Using an agent-based model, we simulated HIV transmission among cisgender MSM in Rhode Island to determine the impacts of PrEP implementation where cisgender MSWs were equally (“standard expansion”) or five times as likely (“focused expansion”) to initiate PrEP compared to other cisgender MSM. Without PrEP, the model predicted 920 new HIV infections over a decade, or an average incidence of 0.39 per 100 person-years. In a focused expansion scenario where 15% of at-risk cisgender MSM used PrEP, the total number of new HIV infections was reduced by 58.1% at a cost of $57,180 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Focused expansion of PrEP use among cisgender MSWs may be an efficient and cost-effective strategy for reducing HIV incidence in the broader population of cisgender MSM."
"The prevalence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) are 5–10% and 2–4%, respectively. PIH might affect angiogenesis in preterm neonates, but its association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains controversial. This study evaluated the association between PIH and BPD in very low-birth weight infants. We retrospectively analysed the maternal, perinatal, and neonatal data of preterm infants born before 30 weeks of gestation, selected from the nationwide registry of very low-birth weight infants, between January 2013 and December 2014. As a result, 1,624 infants without maternal PIH (gestational age: 27.3 ± 1.8 weeks) and 203 infants with maternal PIH (28.0 ± 1.4 weeks, p < 0.001) were included. Birth weight was higher in the non-PIH group, compared with the PIH group (1027.4 ± 250.2 vs. 876.4 ± 261.5 g, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that PIH was associated with BPD (adjusted OR 1.474, 95% confidence interval 1.025–2.121), after adjusting for confounders, including small-for-gestation age (SGA). The result of present study is consistent with the current concept of BPD as an early form of pulmonary vascular disease, for both PIH and BPD are attributed by abnormal vascular formation."
"The diversity in our genome is crucial to understanding the demographic history of worldwide populations. However, we have yet to know whether subtle genetic differences within a population can be disentangled, or whether they have an impact on complex traits. Here we apply dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, PCA-t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA-UMAP) to biobank-derived genomic data of a Japanese population (n = 169,719). Dimensionality reduction reveals fine-scale population structure, conspicuously differentiating adjacent insular subpopulations. We further enluciate the demographic landscape of these Japanese subpopulations using population genetics analyses. Finally, we perform phenome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses on 67 complex traits. Differences in PRS between the deconvoluted subpopulations are not always concordant with those in the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the PRS differences might reflect biases from the uncorrected structure, in a trait-dependent manner. This study suggests that such an uncorrected structure can be a potential pitfall in the clinical application of PRS."
"Using medical images to evaluate disease severity and change over time is a routine and important task in clinical decision making. Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (ρ = 0.87 for ROP and ρ = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging."
"Preterm birth is a common cause of death worldwide of children under the age of five years. This condition is linked with short and long term neonatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has a profound effect on fetal growth and development and subsequently also on the incidence of preterm birth. The aim of this study was to assess the differential effect of dietary patterns of pregnant women across ordered levels of preterm birth. Dietary assessments were performed using a food frequency questionnaire, presented to 687 pregnant women, in the “Mother and Child in the Environment” birth cohort during the period of 2013 to 2017. Each pregnancy resulted in a live birth. Eight dietary patterns were extracted, using exploratory factor analysis. The partial proportional odds model was employed to model severity levels of preterm birth. The partial proportional odds model has been recognized to be a flexible approach since it allows the effect of predictor variables to vary across categories of the ordinal response variable of interest. Women with increased consumption of vegetable-rich foods showed a reduced risk of very to moderately preterm birth incidence (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI = (0.531, 0.981), p = 0.036). Lower odds of very/moderately preterm birth compared to late preterm or term birth were observed for women following “nuts and rice foods” dietary pattern (AOR = 0.25, 95% CI = (0.099, 0.621), p = 0.003). High dietary consumption of starch foods dietary pattern (AOR = 2.09, 95% CI = (1.158, 3.769), p = 0.014) was associated with the most severe level of preterm birth outcome incidence, i.e. very/moderately preterm birth. The partial proportional odds modeling allowed the description of the effect of maternal dietary patterns across the different severity levels of preterm birth."
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) varies a great deal cognitively regarding symptoms, test findings, the rate of progression, and neuroradiologically in terms of atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We hypothesized that an unbiased analysis of the progression of AD, regarding clinical and MRI features, will reveal a number of AD phenotypes. Our objective is to develop and use a computational method for multi-modal analysis of changes in cognitive scores and MRI volumes to test for there being multiple AD phenotypes. In this retrospective cohort study with a total of 857 subjects from the AD (n = 213), MCI (n = 322), and control (CN, n = 322) groups, we used structural MRI data and neuropsychological assessments to develop a novel computational phenotyping method that groups brain regions from MRI and subsets of neuropsychological assessments in a non-biased fashion. The phenotyping method was built based on coupled nonnegative matrix factorization (C-NMF). As a result, the computational phenotyping method found four phenotypes with different combination and progression of neuropsychologic and neuroradiologic features. Identifying distinct AD phenotypes here could help explain why only a subset of AD patients typically respond to any single treatment. This, in turn, will help us target treatments more specifically to certain responsive phenotypes."
"Directed gene therapy mediated by nucleases has become a new alternative to lead targeted integration of therapeutic genes in specific regions in the genome. In this work, we have compared the efficiency of two nuclease types, TALEN and meganucleases (MN), to introduce an EGFP reporter gene in a specific site in a safe harbor locus on chromosome 21 in an intergenic region, named here SH6. The efficiency of targeted integration mediated by SH6v5-MN and SH6-TALEN in HEK-293H cells was up to 16.3 and 15.0%. A stable expression was observed both in the pool of transfected cells and in established pseudoclones, with no detection of off-target integrations by Southern blot. In human hematopoietic stem and progenitor CD34+ cells, the nucleofection process preserved the viability and clonogenic capacity of nucleofected cells, reaching up to 3.1% of specific integration of the transgene in colony forming cells when the SH6-TALEN was used, although no expression of the transgene could be found in these cells. Our results show the possibility to specifically integrate genes at the SH6 locus in CD34+ progenitor cells, although further improvements in the efficacy of the procedure are required before this approach could be used for the gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells in patients with hematopoietic diseases."
"To evaluate the role of conventional contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) imaging and dual-energy spectral CT (DECT) perfusion imaging in differentiating the WHO histological subtypes of thymic epithelial tumours (TETs). Eighty-eight patients with TETs who underwent DECT perfusion scans (n = 51) and conventional CT enhancement scans (n = 37) using a GE Discovery CT750 HD scanner were enrolled in this study. The mean maximal contrast-enhanced range (mean CEmax) and the perfusion and spectral parameters of the lesions were analysed. Among the six WHO subtypes (Type A, AB, B1, B2, and B3 thymoma and thymic carcinoma), the mean CEmax values and most of the perfusion and spectral parameter values of Type A and Type AB were significantly higher than those of the other subtypes (all P < 0.05), and there was no difference among Type B1, B2 and B3 (all P > 0.05). The mean CEmax value was not different between Type B (including Type B1, B2, and B3) and thymic carcinoma (P = 1.000). The PS, IC, NIC and λHU values in the optimal venous phase of thymic carcinoma were higher than those of Type B (all P < 0.05). The parameters of conventional CECT imaging and DECT perfusion imaging can help identify the subtype of TETs, especially those of DECT perfusion imaging in type B thymomas and thymic carcinomas."
"Osteoarthritis affects the morphological properties of the femoral head. The goal of this study was to develop a method to elucidate whether these changes are localised to discrete regions, or if the reported trends in microstructural changes may be identified throughout the subchondral bone of the human femoral head. Whole femoral heads extracted from osteoarthritic (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 5) underwent microCT imaging 39 μm voxel size. The subchondral bone plate was virtually isolated to evaluate the plate thickness and plate porosity. The trabecular bone region was divided into 37 volumes of interest spatially distributed in the femoral head, and bone morphometric properties were determined in each region. The study showed how the developed approach can be used to study the heterogeneous properties of the human femoral head affected by a disease such as osteoarthritis. As example, in the superior femoral head osteoarthritic specimens exhibited a more heterogeneous micro-architecture, with trends towards thicker cortical bone plate, higher trabecular connectivity density, higher trabecular bone density and thicker structures, something that could only be observed with the newly developed approach. Bone cysts were mostly confined to the postero-lateral quadrants extending from the subchondral region into the mid trabecular region. Nevertheless, in order to generalise these findings, a larger sample size should be analysed in the future. This novel method allowed a comprehensive evaluation of the heterogeneous micro-architectural properties of the human femoral head, highlighting effects of OA in the superior subchondral cortical and trabecular bone. Further investigations on different stages of OA would be needed to identify early changes in the bone."
"Estrogens and progesterone control breast development and carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of luminal cells in the mammary epithelium. How they control the extracellular matrix, important to breast physiology and tumorigenesis, remains unclear. Here we report that both hormones induce the secreted protease Adamts18 in myoepithelial cells by controlling Wnt4 expression with consequent paracrine canonical Wnt signaling activation. Adamts18 is required for stem cell activation, has multiple binding partners in the basement membrane and interacts genetically with the basal membrane-specific proteoglycan, Col18a1, pointing to the basement membrane as part of the stem cell niche. In vitro, ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin; in vivo, Adamts18 deletion causes increased collagen deposition during puberty, which results in impaired Hippo signaling and reduced Fgfr2 expression both of which control stem cell function. Thus, Adamts18 links luminal hormone receptor signaling to basement membrane remodeling and stem cell activation."
"Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and impaired intestinal barrier function. Herein, we report that Bofutsushosan (BFT), a Japanese herbal medicine, Kampo, which has been clinically used for constipation in Asian countries, ameliorates glucose metabolism in mice with diet–induced obesity. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis of fecal samples showed that BFT dramatically increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, which was mainly associated with a bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). BFT decreased the gut permeability as assessed by FITC-dextran gavage assay, associated with increased expression of tight-junction related protein, claudin-1, in the colon. The BFT treatment group also showed significant decreases of the plasma endotoxin level and expression of the hepatic lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. Antibiotic treatment abrogated the metabolic effects of BFT. Moreover, many of these changes could be reproduced when the cecal contents of BFT-treated donors were transferred to antibiotic-pretreated high fat diet-fed mice. These data demonstrate that BFT modifies the gut microbiota with an increase in AKK, which may contribute to improving gut barrier function and preventing metabolic endotoxemia, leading to attenuation of diet-induced inflammation and glucose intolerance. Understanding the interaction between a medicine and the gut microbiota may provide insights into new pharmacological targets to improve glucose metabolism."
"There is a growing interest in the automated analysis of chest X-Ray (CXR) as a sensitive and inexpensive means of screening susceptible populations for pulmonary tuberculosis. In this work we evaluate the latest version of CAD4TB, a commercial software platform designed for this purpose. Version 6 of CAD4TB was released in 2018 and is here tested on a fully independent dataset of 5565 CXR images with GeneXpert (Xpert) sputum test results available (854 Xpert positive subjects). A subset of 500 subjects (50% Xpert positive) was reviewed and annotated by 5 expert observers independently to obtain a radiological reference standard. The latest version of CAD4TB is found to outperform all previous versions in terms of area under receiver operating curve (ROC) with respect to both Xpert and radiological reference standards. Improvements with respect to Xpert are most apparent at high sensitivity levels with a specificity of 76% obtained at a fixed 90% sensitivity. When compared with the radiological reference standard, CAD4TB v6 also outperformed previous versions by a considerable margin and achieved 98% specificity at the 90% sensitivity setting. No substantial difference was found between the performance of CAD4TB v6 and any of the various expert observers against the Xpert reference standard. A cost and efficiency analysis on this dataset demonstrates that in a standard clinical situation, operating at 90% sensitivity, users of CAD4TB v6 can process 132 subjects per day at an average cost per screen of $5.95 per subject, while users of version 3 process only 85 subjects per day at a cost of $8.38 per subject. At all tested operating points version 6 is shown to be more efficient and cost effective than any other version."
"When considering the “beauty-is-good” stereotype, facial attractiveness should facilitate empathy for pain. On the other hand, having in mind the “threat value of pain” hypothesis, pain cues would be more salient, and thus, its processing would not suffer influence by facial attractiveness. The event-related potential (ERP) allows investigating if one of these theories could predict individuals’ responses regarding the perception of pain or attractiveness in others’ faces. We tracked 35 participants’ reactions to pictures depicting more and less attractive faces displayed in a painful and non-painful condition. Each participant completed the following two tasks when presented the images of faces: (1) the Pain Judgment Task, in which participants should rate the pain levels, and (2) the Attractiveness Judgment Task, in which participants should rate the attractiveness. Results showed that participants exhibited differences rating more and less attractive faces in the non-painful pictures, but not in the painful pictures. These results were observed in P3 and LPC amplitudes in the Pain Judgment Task, as well as in N170 and P2 amplitudes in the Attractive Judgment Task. Our results suggested that both explicit and implicit empathic pain processing inhibited the processing of attractiveness perception. These findings supported the “threat value of pain” hypothesis. Besides, in the Attractive Judgment Task, the N170 and P2 amplitudes for more attractive painful pictures were larger than those for more attractive non-painful pictures. In contrast, no significant difference was found between the amplitudes for painful and non-painful, less attractive pictures. Our findings suggest that explicit facial attractiveness processing for more attractive face images potentiates the implicit empathy for pain processing, therefore partly supporting the “beautiful-is-good” stereotype."
"Research on acute and chronic lung diseases would greatly benefit from reproducible availability of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Primary alveolar epithelial cells can be derived from human lung tissue but the quality of these cells is highly donor dependent. Here, we demonstrated that culture of EpCAM+ cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) at the physiological air-liquid interface (ALI) resulted in type 2 AEC-like cells (iAEC2) with alveolar characteristics. iAEC2 cells expressed native AEC2 markers (surfactant proteins and LPCAT-1) and contained lamellar bodies. ALI-iAEC2 were used to study alveolar repair over a period of 2 weeks following mechanical wounding of the cultures and the responses were compared with those obtained using primary AEC2 (pAEC2) isolated from resected lung tissue. Addition of the Wnt/β-catenin activator CHIR99021 reduced wound closure in the iAEC2 cultures but not pAEC2 cultures. This was accompanied by decreased surfactant protein expression and accumulation of podoplanin-positive cells at the wound edge. These results demonstrated the feasibility of studying alveolar repair using hiPSC-AEC2 cultured at the ALI and indicated that this model can be used in the future to study modulation of alveolar repair by (pharmaceutical) compounds."
"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) can occur throughout the entire spine and can sometimes lead to spinal disorder. Although patients with OPLL sometimes develop physical limitations because of pain, the characteristics of pain and effects on activities of daily living (ADL) have not been precisely evaluated in OPLL patients. Therefore, we conducted a multi-center prospective study to assess whether the symptoms of cervical OPLL are different from those of cervical spondylosis (CS). A total of 263 patients with a diagnosis of cervical OPLL and 50 patients with a diagnosis of CS were enrolled and provided self-reported outcomes, including responses to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ), JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ), visual analog scale (VAS), and SF-36 scores. The severity of myelopathy was significantly correlated with each domain of the JOACMEQ and JOABPEQ. There was a negative correlation between the VAS score for each domain and the JOA score. There were significantly positive correlations between the JOA score and the Mental Health, Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning, Role Emotional, and Role Physical domains of the SF-36. One-to-one matching resulted in 50 pairs of patients with OPLL and CS. Although there was no significant between-group difference in scores in any of the domains of the JOACMEQ or JOABPEQ, the VAS scores for pain or numbness in the buttocks or limbs were significantly higher in the CS group; however, there was no marked difference in low back pain, chest tightness, or numbness below the chest between the two study groups. The scores for the Role Physical and Body Pain domains of the SF-36 were significantly higher in the OPLL group than in the CS group, and the mean scores for the other domains was similar between the two groups. The results of this study revealed that patients with OPLL were likely to have neck and low back pain and restriction in ADL. No specific type of pain was found in patients with OPLL when compared with those who had CS."
"BackgroundProgression-free survival (PFS) is a surrogate endpoint widely used for overall survival (OS) in oncology. Validation of PFS as a surrogate must be done for each indication and each intervention. We aimed to identify all studies evaluating the validity of PFS as a surrogate for OS in oncology, and to describe their methodological characteristics.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review by searching MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Library with no limitation on time, selected relevant studies and extracted data in duplicate on how surrogacy was evaluated (meta-analytic approach, assessment of correlation and level of evaluation).ResultsWe identified 91 studies evaluating the validity of PFS as a surrogate for OS in 24 cancer localisations. Although a meta-analytic approach was used in 83 (91%) studies, the methods used to validate PFS as a surrogate of OS were heterogeneous across studies. Of the 47 studies concluding that PFS is a good surrogate for OS, for 15 (32%), there was no quantitative argument for surrogacy.ConclusionsAlthough most studies used a meta-analytic approach as recommended, our methodological review highlights heterogeneity in methods and reporting, which stresses the importance of developing and applying clear recommendations in this area."
"Cancer therapies can lead to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular complications. Among these, cardiotoxicities remain of prime concern, but vascular toxicities have emerged as the second most common group. The range of cancer therapies with a vascular toxicity profile and the clinical spectrum of vascular toxic effects are quite broad. Historically, venous thromboembolism has received the greatest attention but, over the past decade, the arterial toxic effects, which can present as acute vasospasm, acute thrombosis and accelerated atherosclerosis, of cancer therapies have gained greater recognition. This Review focuses on these types of cancer therapy-related arterial toxicity, including their mechanisms, and provides an update on venous thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension associated with cancer therapies. Recommendations for the screening, treatment and prevention of vascular toxic effects of cancer therapies are outlined in the context of available evidence and society guidelines and consensus statements. The shift towards greater awareness of the vascular toxic effects of cancer therapies has further unveiled the urgent needs in this area in terms of defining best clinical practices. Well-designed and well-conducted clinical studies and registries are needed to more precisely define the incidence rates, risk factors, primary and secondary modes of prevention, and best treatment modalities for vascular toxicities related to cancer therapies. These efforts should be complemented by preclinical studies to outline the pathophysiological concepts that can be translated into the clinic and to identify drugs with vascular toxicity potential even before their widespread clinical use."
"We analyzed the outcomes of 146 severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients who received a combination of haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) and an unrelated cord-blood (UCB) unit between September 2011 and December 2017. One hundred and seventeen patients underwent transplantation as first-line therapy. Seven patients experienced early mortality, and among the evaluable 139 patients, one patient experienced primary graft failure (GF), while the other 138 patients achieved successful haploidentical donor engraftment; additionally, three patients experienced secondary GF. Six patients demonstrated delayed platelet recovery, and three patients demonstrated platelet GF. The median time for myeloid and platelet engraftment was 11 (range: 9–28) days and 15 (range: 9–330) days, respectively. With a median follow-up of 40 (range: 18–93) months, the cumulative incidences were 31.43% and 10.00% for grades II–IV and grades III–IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respectively. The cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and moderate–severe cGVHD were 36.23% and 11.71%, respectively. There was no patient relapse. The probabilities of 4-year overall survival and GVHD-free, failure-free survival were 81.4 ± 3.3% and 69.2 ± 3.9%, respectively. These encouraging preliminary results indicated that haplo-HSCT combined with the infusion of UCB is a feasible choice for SAA patients without matched donors."
"An intact mucus layer is important in managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dairy Propionibacterium freudenreichii has probiotic potential, produces propionic acid and is known to promote health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of P. freudenreichii on the improvement of colitis. LS 174T goblet cells and a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis rat model were used to investigate the P. freudenreichii-induced stimulation of mucin production in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MUC2, a main component of intestinal mucus, increased in the supernatant of P. freudenreichii culture (SPFC)-treated LS 174 cells. The SPFC and live P. freudenreichii (LPF) reduced the disease activity index (DAI) in the rats with DSS-induced colitis. After treatment with SPFC or LPF, the mRNA levels of typical pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased and the inflammatory state was histologically improved in the rats with DSS-induced colitis. The SPFC and LPF treatments increased the gene and protein expression levels of MUC2 in the rats with DSS-induced colitis compared with the expression levels in the negative control rats, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed an increase of the intestinal MUC2 level. In addition, SPFC and LPF augmented the level of propionate in the faeces of the rats with DSS-induced colitis. In conclusion, P. freudenreichii might improve acute colitis by restoring goblet cell number and stimulating the expression of MUC2 in intestinal goblet cells."
"A deep learning-based image analysis could improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pathology work. Recently, we proposed a deep learning-based detection algorithm for C4d immunostaining in renal allografts. The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of the algorithm by comparing pathologists’ diagnoses and analyzing the associations of the algorithm with clinical data. C4d immunostaining slides of renal allografts were obtained from two different institutions (100 slides from the Asan Medical Center and 86 slides from the Seoul National University Hospital) and scanned using two different slide scanners. Three pathologists and the algorithm independently evaluated each slide according to the Banff 2017 criteria. Subsequently, they jointly reviewed the results for consensus scoring. The result of the algorithm was compared with that of each pathologist and the consensus diagnosis. Clinicopathological associations of the results of the algorithm with allograft survival, histologic evidence of microvascular inflammation, and serologic results for donor-specific antibodies were also analyzed. As a result, the reproducibility between the pathologists was fair to moderate (kappa 0.36–0.54), which is comparable to that between the algorithm and each pathologist (kappa 0.34–0.51). The C4d scores predicted by the algorithm achieved substantial concordance with the consensus diagnosis (kappa = 0.61), and they were significantly associated with remarkable microvascular inflammation (P = 0.001), higher detection rate of donor-specific antibody (P = 0.003), and shorter graft survival (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the deep learning-based C4d detection algorithm showed a diagnostic performance similar to that of the pathologists."
"Strong interactions between cross-bridges (XB) and regulatory units (RU) lead to a steep response of cardiac muscle to an increase in intracellular calcium. We developed a model to quantitatively assess the influence of different types of interactions within the sarcomere on the properties of cardiac muscle. In the model, the ensembles consisting of cross-bridge groups connected by elastic tropomyosin are introduced, and their dynamics is described by a set of partial differential equations. Through large scans in the free energy landscape, we demonstrate the different influence of RU-RU, XB-XB, and XB-RU interactions on the cooperativity coefficient of calcium binding, developed maximal force, and calcium sensitivity. The model solution was fitted to reproduce experimental data on force development during isometric contraction, shortening in physiological contraction, and ATP consumption by acto-myosin. On the basis of the fits, we quantified the free energy change introduced through RU-RU and XB-XB interactions and showed that RU-RU interaction leads to ~ 5 times larger change in the free energy profile of the reaction than XB-XB interaction. Due to the deterministic description of muscle contraction and its thermodynamic consistency, we envision that the developed model can be used to study heart muscle biophysics on tissue and organ levels."
"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic and relapsing disease with a substantial genetic influence. Given the recent discovery of the association of PPM1G methylation with alcohol use disorder (AUD) from a genome-wide methylation study, we sought to verify and extend the previous work of AUD-related impulsivity in a Korean population with AUD. A total of 244 men with AUD were assessed for psychological characteristics and behavioral impulsivity using stop signal task (response inhibition) and Balloon Analog Risk Task (risk-taking). Leukocyte DNA methylation at PPM1G was quantified using pyrosequencing. The effects of PPM1G methylation on severity of problematic drinking measured by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and multidimensional impulsivity were tested using linear regression analyses. Hypermethylation of PPM1G was significantly associated with risk-taking propensity among men with AUD. No significant association of PPM1G methylation was found to be associated with AUDIT scores and response inhibition. Our findings indicate that altered methylation of PPM1G may influence the impulsive choice of risk-taking in AUD. Further research is required in order to determine the role of PPM1G in the pathophysiology of AUD and multidimensional impulsivity."
"Nationwide population-based cohort provides a new opportunity to build an automated risk prediction model based on individuals’ history of health and healthcare beyond existing risk prediction models. We tested the possibility of machine learning models to predict future incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using large-scale administrative health data. From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010, we obtained de-identified health data in elders above 65 years (N = 40,736) containing 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness and socio-demographics. To define incident AD we considered two operational definitions: “definite AD” with diagnostic codes and dementia medication (n = 614) and “probable AD” with only diagnosis (n = 2026). We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on “definite AD” and “probable AD” outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level. This study may shed a light on the utility of the data-driven machine learning model based on large-scale administrative health data in AD risk prediction, which may enable better selection of individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials or early detection in clinical settings."
"BackgroundNeonates with apnea of prematurity often fail CPAP because it does not provide adequate support during apnea. NAVA provides proportional ventilator support based on electrical activity of the diaphragm. When the NAVA level is 0 cmH20/mcV, the patient receives minimal support above PEEP when breathing and backup ventilation when apneic. This study compares number of clinically significant events on CPAP versus noninvasive NAVA level 0.MethodsRetrospective study of preterm neonates having apnea of prematurity on nasal CPAP. Patients were then placed on NAVA level 0. The number of events on each mode was collected. Statistics were paired t-test.ResultsSeventeen subjects with gestational age 26.1 ± 1.7 weeks, study age 19.5 ± 12.5 days. Events decreased from 17.9 ± 7.8 on CPAP to 10.2 ± 8.1 events on NAVA level 0 (p = 0.00047).ConclusionsNAVA level 0 reduced the number of clinically significant events compared with CPAP in premature neonates with apnea of prematurity."
"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a multi-factorial disorder including central obesity (CO), insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension which increases the risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. CO is considered as an essential component of MetS according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), which may further modulate distinct signalling pathways compared with the other four MetS risk factors. Given that ghrelin signalling and the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis regulates energy balance and metabolic homeostasis, this study examined the changes in various ghrelin products and circulating hormones in response to the interaction between CO and other MetS components including blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 133 Hong Kong Chinese adults. Circulating obestatin and GH were increased and reduced, respectively, by either CO or the other 4-risk factor cluster. These changes were further augmented by the presence of all MetS risk factors. However, changes of ghrelin levels were not mediated by CO but the other MetS risk factors. Our findings suggest that CO does not predict all the dysregulation of signalling pathways in individuals with MetS. Although CO and other MetS may share common signalling targets (i.e., obestatin and GH), CO does not contribute to the perturbation of ghrelin signalling."
"Spirometry is recommended in symptomatic smokers to identify obstructive lung diseases. However, it is unknown whether there are certain characteristics that can be used to identify the individual risk of developing obstructive lung diseases. The aim of this study was to examine the association between lung function in adults and burden of lung diseases throughout 27 years of follow-up. We performed a cohort study among individuals aged 30–49 years at baseline (1991). Spirometry measurements were divided into three groups: (1) FEV1/FVC < 70, (2) FEV1/FVC: 70–75, (3) FEV1/FVC > 75 (reference). Using negative binominal regression, the burden of lung diseases was measured by contacts to general practice, hospitalisations, redeemed respiratory medicine and socioeconomic parameters between 1991 and 2017. A total of 905 citizens were included; mean age of 40.3 years, 47.5% were males and 51.2% were smokers at baseline. The group with an FEV1/FVC: 70–75 received more respiratory medicine (IRR = 3.37 (95% CI: 2.69–4.23)), had lower income (IRR = 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93–0.98)), and had more contacts to general practice (IRR = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.07–1.21)) and hospitals for lung diseases (IRR = 2.39 (95% CI: 1.96–5.85)) compared to the reference group. We found an association between lung function and the future burden of lung diseases throughout 27 years of follow-up. In particular, adults with an FEV1/FVC: 70–75 need extra attention in the case finding."
"To examine preoperative use of intravitreal dexamethasone implant in patients with refractory diabetic macular edema (DME) undergoing cataract surgery. Participants in this study were 17 patients with DME refractory to previous treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents or dexamethasone implant, and co-existent cataract. All participants received intravitreal dexamethasone implant at baseline and underwent phacoemulsification within one month after its insertion. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST) changes between baseline, time of cataract surgery and postoperative months 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated. At month 1 after surgery, BCVA improved significantly from 42.3 ± 9.6 to 58.7 ± 11.9 letters compared to baseline (p < 0.001) and the improvement was sustained at month 2 and month 3 postoperatively. One month postoperatively, CST improved significantly compared to baseline (p < 0.001) and the improvement was sustained at month 2 (p < 0.001), while at month 3 CST started to increase, but remained significantly lower than baseline (p = 0.003). At month 3 postoperatively, 35.3% of patients presented recurrence of ME. Patients with refractory DME and cataract can safely undergo phacoemulsification when dexamethasone implant is inserted one month prior to surgery to ensure adequate control of postoperative inflammation and prevent deterioration of ME."
"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is a key priming activity of fibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis during silicosis. Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) is a critical modulator that promotes functional changes in cells, and the effects are mediated by oxidative stress (OS). However, whether ELK-1 is involved in EMT of silicosis remains unclear. In addition, researchers have found that Elk-1 is involved in the expression of the gene zc3h12a, which encodes the protein MCPIP1, and MCPIP1 is a member of the zinc finger Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH)-type protein family. A previous study from our lab showed that ZC3H4, which is also a member of the CCCH-type protein family, critically affected the regulation of EMT during silicosis. However, it has not yet been elucidated if ELK-1 acts at the promoter for zc3h4 to increase its expression in a mechanism that is similar to that of the zc3h12a gene and whether such regulation ultimately controls EMT. Therefore, we explored the correlation between ELK-1 and ZC3H4 expression and tested the underlying mechanisms affecting ELK-1 activation induced by silica. Our study identifies that SiO2-mediated EMT via ELK-1, with the upstream activity of OS and the downstream signaling of ZC3H4 expression resulting in enhanced EMT. These findings suggest that the nuclear transcription factor ELK-1 may be useful as a novel target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."
"Although impaired ability to regulate emotion is commonly reported in schizophrenic patients, the exact pattern of regulation of negative emotions in high-risk individuals remains unclear. In the current study, 26 high-schizotypy individuals paired with 26 controls completed an emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ) and a laboratory emotion regulation task with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Two emotion regulation strategies, namely, reappraisal and expression suppression, were concurrently examined. The late positive potential (LPP) and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) were selected as two independent neural indicators of the emotion regulation effect. In the ERQ questionnaire, individuals in the high schizotypy group reported higher habitual use of suppression than the controls. During the emotion regulation task, the high  schizotypy group showed no early LPP reduction in reappraisal compared with the control group and exhibited a general negative FAA pattern (left-biased alpha). In conclusion, we found that individuals with high schizotypy exhibited maladaptive regulation of negative emotions, manifested in hindered reappraisal and biased suppression; this may exacerbate the negative affect of such emotions and further serve as a risk factor for psychosis conversion. Early interventions targeting the regulation of negative emotions may be beneficial for individuals with high schizotypal traits."
"Cerebral metabolism, which can be monitored by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), changes rapidly after brain ischaemic injury. Hyperpolarisation techniques boost 13C MRS sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling in vivo monitoring of biochemical transformations of hyperpolarised (HP) 13C-labelled precursors with a time resolution of seconds. The exogenous administration of the metabolite L-lactate was shown to decrease lesion size and ameliorate neurological outcome in preclinical studies in rodent stroke models, as well as influencing brain metabolism in clinical pilot studies of acute brain injury patients. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring HP [1-13C] L-lactate metabolism in real-time in the mouse brain after ischaemic stroke when administered after reperfusion at a therapeutic dose. We showed a rapid, time-after-reperfusion-dependent conversion of [1-13C] L-lactate to [1-13C] pyruvate and [13C] bicarbonate that brings new insights into the neuroprotection mechanism of L-lactate. Moreover, this study paves the way for the use of HP [1-13C] L-lactate as a sensitive molecular-imaging biosensor in ischaemic stroke patients after endovascular clot removal."
"Intensive analysis of the SMARCB1 gene in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) revealed eight of 16 patients with constitutional genetic variants. Three patients had mosaicism of deletion/variant of the SMARCB1 gene, which conventional methods might overlook. The prevalence of cancer predisposition in MRT may thus be higher than previously reported."
"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis showing complex epidemiological patterns that are poorly understood in South Africa. Large outbreaks occur in the central interior at long, irregular intervals, most recently in 2010–2011; however, the level of herd immunity of ruminant livestock, a key determinant of outbreaks, is unknown. During 2015–2016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence, patterns of, and factors associated with, antibodies to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak. A RVFV inhibition ELISA was used to screen 977 cattle, 1,549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. The estimated RVFV seroprevalence, adjusted for survey design, was 42.9% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats, showing a high degree of farm-level clustering. Seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs. communal land, on farms with seasonal pans (temporary, shallow wetlands) and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals. Seropositivity amongst unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak indicates likely viral circulation during the post-epidemic period. The current level of herd immunity in livestock may be insufficient to prevent another large outbreak, should suitable conditions recur."
"While cancer-associated stroma (CAS) in malignant tumours is well described, stromal changes in benign forms of naturally occurring tumours remain poorly characterized. Spontaneous canine mammary carcinomas (mCA) are viewed as excellent models of human mCA. We have recently reported highly conserved stromal reprogramming between canine and human mCA based on transcriptome analysis of laser-capture-microdissected FFPE specimen. To identify stromal changes between benign and malignant mammary tumours, we have analysed matched normal and adenoma-associated stroma (AAS) from 13 canine mammary adenomas and compared them to previous data from 15 canine mCA. Our analyses reveal distinct stromal reprogramming even in small benign tumours. While similarities between AAS and CAS exist, the stromal signature clearly distinguished adenomas from mCA. The distinction between AAS and CAS is further substantiated by differential enrichment in several hallmark signalling pathways as well as differential abundance in cellular composition. Finally, we identify COL11A1, VIT, CD74, HLA-DRA, STRA6, IGFBP4, PIGR, and TNIP1 as strongly discriminatory stromal genes between adenoma and mCA, and demonstrate their prognostic value for human breast cancer. Given the relevance of canine CAS as a model for the human disease, our approach identifies disease-modulating stromal components with implications for both human and canine breast cancer."
"CCL5 is a unique chemokine with distinct stage and cell-type specificities for regulating inflammation, but how these specificities are achieved and how CCL5 modulates immune responses is not well understood. Here we identify two stage-specific enhancers: the proximal enhancer mediates the constitutive CCL5 expression during the steady state, while the distal enhancer located 1.35 Mb from the promoter induces CCL5 expression in activated cells. Both enhancers are antagonized by RUNX/CBFβ complexes, and SATB1 further mediates the long-distance interaction of the distal enhancer with the promoter. Deletion of the proximal enhancer decreases CCL5 expression and augments the cytotoxic activity of tissue-resident T and NK cells, which coincides with reduced melanoma metastasis in mouse models. By contrast, increased CCL5 expression resulting from RUNX3 mutation is associated with more tumor metastasis in the lung. Collectively, our results suggest that RUNX3-mediated CCL5 repression is critical for modulating anti-tumor immunity."
"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used in transplantation settings, but also as a method of choice for in-depth analysis of population-specific HLA genetic architecture and its linkage to various diseases. With respect to complex ethnic admixture characteristic for East Croatian population, we aimed to investigate class-I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class-II (HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1) HLA diversity at the highest, 4-field resolution level in 120 healthy, unrelated, blood donor volunteers. Genomic DNA was extracted and HLA genotypes of class I and DQA1 genes were defined in full-length, -DQB1 from intron 1 to 3′ UTR, and -DRB1 from intron 1 to intron 4 (Illumina MiSeq platform, Omixon Twin algorithms, IMGT/HLA release 3.30.0_5). Linkage disequilibrium statistics, Hardy-Weinberg departures, and haplotype frequencies were inferred by exact tests and iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm using PyPop 0.7.0 and Arlequin v3.5.2.2 software. Our data provide first description of 4-field allele and haplotype frequencies in Croatian population, revealing 192 class-I and class-II alleles and extended haplotypic combinations not apparent from the existing 2-field HLA reports from Croatia. This established reference database complements current knowledge of HLA diversity and should prove useful in future population studies, transplantation settings, and disease-associated HLA screening."
"Biallelic variants in the EYS gene are a major cause of autosomal recessive inherited retinal disease (IRD), with a high prevalence in the Asian population. The purpose of this study was to identify pathogenic EYS variants, to determine the clinical/genetic spectrum of EYS-associated retinal disease (EYS-RD), and to discover disease-associated variants with relatively high allele frequency (1%-10%) in a nationwide Japanese cohort. Sixty-six affected subjects from 61 families with biallelic or multiple pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were ascertained by whole-exome sequencing. Three phenotype groups were identified in EYS-RD: retinitis pigmentosa (RP; 85.94%), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD; 10.94%), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA; 3.12%). Twenty-six pathogenic/disease-associated EYS variants were identified, including seven novel variants. The two most prevalent variants, p.(Gly843Glu) and p.(Thr2465Ser) were found in 26 and twelve families (42.6%, 19.7%), respectively, for which the allele frequency (AF) in the Japanese population was 2.2% and 3.0%, respectively. These results expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of EYS-RD, accounting for a high proportion of EYS-RD both in autosomal recessive RP (23.4%) and autosomal recessive CORD (9.9%) in the Japanese population. The presence of EYS variants with relatively high AF highlights the importance of considering the pathogenicity of non-rare variants in relatively prevalent Mendelian disorders."
"High levels of methylation in the GR gene (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1; NR3C1) have been associated with depression and cardiovascular risk. This study aimed to investigate whether NR3C1 methylation status was associated with the long-term prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) considering depression and cardiovascular status at the early phase of ACS. A total of 969 patients with recent ACS were recruited at a tertiary university hospital in Korea. Baseline evaluations were made from 2007 to 2012, including DSM-IV depressive disorder, NR3C1 methylation, and various demographic and clinical characteristics such as cardiovascular risk markers. Over a 5~12 year follow-up after the index ACS, time to major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was investigated using Cox regression models. Higher NR3C1 methylation status was associated with depression and several cardiovascular risk markers at baseline. NR3C1 hypermethylation predicted worse long-term prognosis of ACS only in the presence of depressive disorder with significant synergistic interaction terms and independent of potential confounding factors. Synergistic effects of depressive disorder and NR3C1 hypermethylation on long-term cardiac outcomes in ACS were found. NR3C1 methylation status represents a candidate prognostic biomarker for ACS in combination with a diagnosis of depressive disorder. Further research is needed to ascertain the generalisability of these findings."
"Diverticula are outpouchings of the intestinal wall and are common anatomical alterations detected in the human colon. Colonic diverticulosis (the presence of diverticula in the colon; referred to as diverticulosis) remains asymptomatic in most individuals but ~25% of individuals will develop symptomatic diverticulosis, termed colonic diverticular disease (also known as diverticular disease). Diverticular disease can range in severity from symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) to symptomatic disease with complications such as acute diverticulitis or diverticular haemorrhage. Since the early 2000s, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of diverticulosis and diverticular disease, which encompasses genetic alterations, chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis, has led to improvements in diagnosis and management. Diagnosis of diverticular disease relies on imaging approaches, such as ultrasonography, CT and MRI, as biomarkers alone are insufficient to establish a diagnosis despite their role in determining disease severity and progression as well as in differential diagnosis. Treatments for diverticular disease include dietary fibre, pharmacological treatments such as antibiotics (rifaximin), anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalazine) and probiotics, alone or in combination, and eventually surgery. Despite being effective in treating primary disease, their effectiveness in primary and secondary prevention of complications is still uncertain."
"IDH1-mutated gliomas are slow-growing brain tumours which progress into high-grade gliomas. The early molecular events causing this progression are ill-defined. Previous studies revealed that 20% of these tumours already have transformation foci. These foci offer opportunities to better understand malignant progression. We used immunohistochemistry and high throughput RNA profiling to characterize foci cells. These have higher pSTAT3 staining revealing activation of JAK/STAT signaling. They downregulate RNAs involved in Wnt signaling (DAAM2, SFRP2), EGFR signaling (MLC1), cytoskeleton and cell-cell communication (EZR, GJA1). In addition, foci cells show reduced levels of RNA coding for Ethanolamine-Phosphate Phospho-Lyase (ETNPPL/AGXT2L1), a lipid metabolism enzyme. ETNPPL is involved in the catabolism of phosphoethanolamine implicated in membrane synthesis. We detected ETNPPL protein in glioma cells as well as in astrocytes in the human brain. Its nuclear localization suggests additional roles for this enzyme. ETNPPL expression is inversely correlated to glioma grade and we found no ETNPPL protein in glioblastomas. Overexpression of ETNPPL reduces the growth of glioma stem cells indicating that this enzyme opposes gliomagenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that a combined alteration in membrane lipid metabolism and STAT3 pathway promotes IDH1-mutated glioma malignant progression."
"The prevalence of dry eye disease is high worldwide and poses a great burden on patients’ daily lives. Accurate diagnosis of the disease is important, and it requires application of various methods. Hyperosmolarity is believed to be the disease marker and thus measuring it provides useful information. In this study we investigated utility of tear osmolarity measured with TearLab osmometer, along with other diagnostic tests (Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, Tear film break-up time, Ocular Protection Index, Ocular Surface Staining, Schirmer I test, Meibomian gland functionality in 757 patients (1514 eyes) with dry eye disease and 29 healthy controls (58 eyes). Statistical differences between the patient group and the control group were observed for all the tests apart from tear osmolarity, regardless of cut-off value (>308 mOsm/L, >316 mOsm/L, and inter-eye difference >8 mOsm/L). Moreover, in the receiver operating characteristics curve analyses tear osmolarity measurement could not discriminate dry eye disease pathological scores. Therefore, our study suggests that tear osmolarity measured with TearLab osmometer cannot be used as a key indicator of DED."
"Anthracyclines used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) inhibit the activity of the mammalian topoisomerase II (topo II) isoforms, topo II α and topo IIβ. In 230 patients with non-M3 AML who received frontline ara-C/daunorubicin we determined expression of topo IIα and topo IIβ by RT-PCR and its relationship to immunophenotype (IP) and outcomes. Treatment outcomes were analyzed by logistic or Cox regression. In 211 patients, available for analysis, topo IIα expression was significantly lower than topo IIβ (P < 0.0001). In contrast to topo IIα, topo IIβ was significantly associated with blast percentage in marrow or blood (P = 0.0001), CD7 (P = 0.01), CD14 (P < 0.0001) and CD54 (P < 0.0001). Event free survival was worse for CD56-negative compared to CD56-high (HR = 1.9, 95% CI [1.0–3.5], p = 0.04), and overall survival was worse for CD-15 low as compared to CD15-high (HR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.1–4.2], p = 0.02). Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated topo IIβ and immunophenotype markers in a network associated with cell-to-cell signaling, hematological system development/function and inflammatory response. Topo IIβ expression reflects disease biology of highly proliferative disease and distinct IP but does not appear to be an independent variable influencing outcome in adult AML patients treated with anthracycline-based therapy."
"The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-21. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection2. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the identity of any intermediate host that might have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission."
"Automated quantification of tissue morphology and tracer uptake in PET/MR images could streamline the analysis compared to traditional manual methods. To validate a single atlas image segmentation approach for automated assessment of tissue volume, fat content (FF) and glucose uptake (GU) from whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/MR images. Twelve subjects underwent whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/MRI during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Automated analysis of tissue volumes, FF and GU were achieved using image registration to a single atlas image with reference segmentations of 18 volume of interests (VOIs). Manual segmentations by an experienced radiologist were used as reference. Quantification accuracy was assessed with Dice scores, group comparisons and correlations. VOI Dice scores ranged from 0.93 to 0.32. Muscles, brain, VAT and liver showed the highest scores. Pancreas, large and small intestines demonstrated lower segmentation accuracy and poor correlations. Estimated tissue volumes differed significantly in 8 cases. Tissue FFs were often slightly but significantly overestimated. Satisfactory agreements were observed in most tissue GUs. Automated tissue identification and characterization using a single atlas segmentation performs well compared to manual segmentation in most tissues and will be valuable in future studies. In certain tissues, alternative quantification methods or improvements to the current approach is needed."
"Glioblastoma multiforme is characterized in part by severe hypoxia associated with tumor necrosis. The cellular response to hypoxia can influence several properties of tumor cells associated with aggressive tumor growth, including metabolic adaptations and tumor cell migration and invasion. Here, we found that Delta Like Non-Canonical Notch Ligand 1 (DLK1) expression was elevated as compared with normal brain in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma, and that DLK1 expression increased with tumor grade in human glioma samples. DLK1 expression was highest in hypoxic and perivascular tumor areas, and we found that hypoxia induced the release and nuclear translocation of an intracellular fragment of DLK1 in murine glioma as well as in human glioma cultures. Release of the intracellular fragment was dependent on ADAM17 and Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1alpha and 2alpha (HIF-1alpha/HIF-2alpha), as ADAM17 inhibitors and HIF1A/HIF2A siRNA blocked DLK1 cleavage. Expression of a cleavable form of DLK1 amplified several hypoxia-induced traits of glioma cells such as colony formation, stem cell marker gene expression, a PI3K-pathway-mediated metabolic shift, and enhanced invasiveness. Effects of DLK1 were dependent on DLK1-cleavage by ADAM17, as expression of non-cleavable DLK1 could not replicate the DLK1-induced hypoxic phenotype. Finally, forced expression of DLK1 resulted in more invasive tumor growth in a PDGFB-induced glioma mouse model without affecting overall survival. Together, our findings suggest a previously undescribed role for DLK1 as an intracellular signaling molecule."
"Radiologic screening of high-risk adults reduces lung-cancer-related mortality1,2; however, a small minority of eligible individuals undergo such screening in the United States3,4. The availability of blood-based tests could increase screening uptake. Here we introduce improvements to cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq)5, a method for the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), to better facilitate screening applications. We show that, although levels are very low in early-stage lung cancers, ctDNA is present prior to treatment in most patients and its presence is strongly prognostic. We also find that the majority of somatic mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with lung cancer and of risk-matched controls reflect clonal haematopoiesis and are non-recurrent. Compared with tumour-derived mutations, clonal haematopoiesis mutations occur on longer cfDNA fragments and lack mutational signatures that are associated with tobacco smoking. Integrating these findings with other molecular features, we develop and prospectively validate a machine-learning method termed ‘lung cancer likelihood in plasma’ (Lung-CLiP), which can robustly discriminate early-stage lung cancer patients from risk-matched controls. This approach achieves performance similar to that of tumour-informed ctDNA detection and enables tuning of assay specificity in order to facilitate distinct clinical applications. Our findings establish the potential of cfDNA for lung cancer screening and highlight the importance of risk-matching cases and controls in cfDNA-based screening studies."
"While full-night polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, its limitations include a high cost and first-night effects. This study developed an algorithm for the detection of respiratory events based on impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar and verified its feasibility for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. A total of 94 subjects were enrolled in this study (23 controls and 24, 14, and 33 with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea, respectively). Abnormal breathing detected by impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar was defined as a drop in the peak radar signal by ≥30% from that in the pre-event baseline. We compared the abnormal breathing index obtained from impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar and apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) measured from polysomnography. There was an excellent agreement between the Abnormal Breathing Index and AHI (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.927). The overall agreements of the impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar were 0.93 for Model 1 (AHI ≥ 5), 0.91 for Model 2 (AHI ≥ 15), and 1 for Model 3 (AHI ≥ 30). Impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar accurately detected respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) during sleep without subject contact. Therefore, impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar may be used as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea."
"The use of programmed intermittent epidural bolus for postoperative analgesia may have greater analgesic efficacy than continuous epidural infusion. However, the rapid delivery speed used with an epidural bolus is more likely to increase intracranial pressure. We compared the effects of lumbar epidural bolus versus continuous infusion epidural analgesia on intracranial pressure in children using optic nerve sheath diameter as a marker. We randomly assigned 40 paediatric patients to bolus or infusion groups. Epidural analgesia (0.15% ropivacaine 0.3 ml·kg−1) was administered via bolus or infusion. Ultrasonography was used to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter before (T0), at 3 min (T1), 10 min (T2), and 70 min (T3) after starting the pump. There were statistically significant between-group differences in optic nerve sheath diameter over time (PGroup x Time = 0.045). From T0–T3, the area under the curve values were similar between the two groups. Although there were differences in the patterns of optic nerve sheath diameter change according to the delivery mode, the use of lumbar epidural bolus did not increase the risk of intracranial pressure increase over that of continuous infusion. Further research is needed to investigate intracranial pressure changes after continuous application of each delivery mode."
"Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that occurs when the breathing of a person is interrupted during the sleep. This interruption occurs because of the patient has narrowed airways and the upper airways muscles relax, closes in and blocks the airway. Therefore, any forces or reaction originated by the air flow dynamics over the relaxed upper airways muscles could make to close the upper airways, and consequently the air could not flow into your lungs, provoking sleep apnea. Fully describing the dynamic behavior of the airflow in this area is a severe challenge for the physicians. In this paper we explore the dynamic behavior of airflow in the upper airways of 6 patients suffering obstructive sleep apnea with/without a mandibular advancement device using computational fluid dynamics. The development of flow unsteadiness from a laminar state at entry to the pharynx through to the turbulent character in the soft palate area is resolved using an accurate numerical model. Combining the airflow solution with a geometrical analysis of the upper airways reveals the positive effects of mandibular advance device in the air flow behavior (pressure drop). Improved modeling of airflow and positioning of mandibular advance device could be applied to improve diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea."
"Optimal clinical decision-making depends on identification of clinically relevant organisms present in a sample. Standard microbiological culture may fail to identify unusual or fastidious organisms and can misrepresent relative abundance of sample constituents. Culture-independent methods have improved our ability to deconvolute polymicrobial patient samples. We used next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing (NGS16S) to determine how often cultivatable organisms in complex polymicrobial samples are not reported by standard culture. Twenty consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were plated to standard and additional media; bacteria were identified by NGS16S analysis of DNA extracted directly from samples or from washed culture plates. 96% of organisms identified were cultivable, but only 21% were reported by standard culture, indicating that standard work-up provides an incomplete assessment of microbial constituents. Direct NGS16S correlated well with standard culture, identifying the same predominant organism in 50% of samples. When predominant organisms differed, NGS16S most often detected anaerobes, whose growth is unsupported by standard culture conditions for this specimen. NGS16S identified more organisms per sample and allowed identification of fastidious organisms, while culture was better at capturing organisms when bacterial load was low, and allowed incidental recovery of non-bacterial pathogens. Molecular and culture-based methods together detect more organisms than either method alone."
"Following a single blind, cross-over and non-randomized design we investigated the effect of 7-day use of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash on the salivary microbiome as well as several saliva and plasma biomarkers in 36 healthy individuals. They rinsed their mouth (for 1 min) twice a day for seven days with a placebo mouthwash and then repeated this protocol with CHX mouthwash for a further seven days. Saliva and blood samples were taken at the end of each treatment to analyse the abundance and diversity of oral bacteria, and pH, lactate, glucose, nitrate and nitrite concentrations. CHX significantly increased the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and reduced the content of Bacteroidetes, TM7, SR1 and Fusobacteria. This shift was associated with a significant decrease in saliva pH and buffering capacity, accompanied by an increase in saliva lactate and glucose levels. Lower saliva and plasma nitrite concentrations were found after using CHX, followed by a trend of increased systolic blood pressure. Overall, this study demonstrates that mouthwash containing CHX is associated with a major shift in the salivary microbiome, leading to more acidic conditions and lower nitrite availability in healthy individuals."
"Genomic destabilisation is associated with the induction of mutations, including those in cancer-driver genes, and subsequent clonal evolution of cells with abrogated defence systems. Such mutations are not induced when genome stability is maintained; however, the mechanisms involved in genome stability maintenance remain elusive. Here, resveratrol (and related polyphenols) is shown to enhance genome stability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ultimately protecting the cells against the induction of mutations in the ARF/p53 pathway. Replication stress-associated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that accumulated with genomic destabilisation were effectively reduced by resveratrol treatment. In addition, resveratrol transiently stabilised the expression of histone H2AX, which is involved in DSB repair. Similar effects on the maintenance of genome stability were observed for related polyphenols. Accordingly, we propose that polyphenol consumption can contribute to the suppression of cancers that develop with genomic instability, as well as lifespan extension."
"BackgroundThe small GTPase Ran is upregulated in multiple cancers and fundamental for cancer cell survival and progression, but its significance and molecular mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive.MethodsRan expression was detected in CRC cell lines and tumour tissues. In vitro and in vivo functional assays were performed to examine the effects of Ran on cell proliferation and metastasis. The pathways and effectors regulated by Ran were explored by an unbiased screening. Bioinformatics prediction and experimental validation were used to identify the miRNA regulator for Ran.ResultsRan expression was frequently increased in metastatic CRC cells and tissues, especially in metastatic tissues. The upregulation of Ran correlated with poor CRC patient prognosis. Ran silencing reduced proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Ran regulated the expression of EGFR and activation of ERK and AKT signalling pathways. miR-802 was identified as an upstream regulator of Ran and miR-802 overexpression resulted in antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities.ConclusionOur study demonstrates the oncogenic roles and underlying mechanisms of Ran in CRC and the novel miR-802/Ran/EGFR regulatory axis may provide potential biomarkers for the treatment of CRC."
"Pulmonary veins (PV) are involved in the pathophysiology of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In the rat, left atrium (LA) and PV cardiomyocytes have different reactions to α1-adrenergic receptor activation. In freely beating atria-PV preparations, we found that electrical field potential (EFP) originated from the sino-atrial node propagated through the LA and the PV. The α1-adrenergic receptor agonist cirazoline induced a progressive loss of EFP conduction in the PV whereas it was maintained in the LA. This could be reproduced in preparations electrically paced at 5 Hz in LA. During pacing at 10 Hz in the PV where high firing rate ectopic foci can occur, cirazoline stopped EFP conduction from the PV to the LA, which allowed the sino-atrial node to resume its pace-making function. Loss of conduction in the PV was associated with depolarization of the diastolic membrane potential of PV cardiomyocytes. Adenosine, which reversed the cirazoline-induced depolarization of the diastolic membrane potential of PV cardiomyocytes, restored full over-shooting action potentials and EFP conduction in the PV. In conclusion, selective activation of α1-adrenergic receptors results in the abolition of electrical conduction within the PV. These results highlight a potentially novel pharmacological approach to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by targeting directly the PV myocardium."
"A fundamental assumption of nearly all functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses is that the relationship between local neuronal activity and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal can be described as following linear systems theory. With the advent of ultra-high field (7T and higher) MRI scanners, it has become possible to perform sub-millimeter resolution fMRI in humans. A novel and promising application of sub-millimeter fMRI is measuring responses across cortical depth, i.e. laminar imaging. However, the cortical vasculature and associated directional blood pooling towards the pial surface strongly influence the cortical depth-dependent BOLD signal, particularly for gradient-echo BOLD. This directional pooling may potentially affect BOLD linearity across cortical depth. Here we assess whether the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory holds across cortical depth. For this, we use stimuli with different luminance contrasts to elicit different BOLD response amplitudes. We find that BOLD amplitude across cortical depth scales with luminance contrast, and that this scaling is identical across cortical depth. Although nonlinearities may be present for different stimulus configurations and acquisition protocols, our results suggest that the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory across cortical depth holds for luminance contrast manipulations in sub-millimeter laminar BOLD fMRI."
"Aberrant expression of miRNAs in pancreatic islets is closely related to the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study was to identify key miRNAs dysregulated in pancreatic islets during T1D progression and to develop a theranostic approach to modify their expression using an MRI-based nanodrug consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to miRNA-targeting oligonucleotides in a mouse model of T1D. Isolated pancreatic islets were derived from NOD mice of three distinct age groups (3, 8 and 18-week-old). Total RNA collected from cultured islets was purified and global miRNA profiling was performed with 3D-Gene global miRNA microarray mouse chips encompassing all mouse miRNAs available on the Sanger miRBase V16. Of the miRNAs that were found to be differentially expressed across three age groups, we identified one candidate (miR-216a) implicated in beta cell proliferation for subsequent validation by RT-PCR. Alterations in miR-216a expression within pancreatic beta cells were also examined using in situ hybridization on the frozen pancreatic sections. For in vitro studies, miR-216a mimics/inhibitors were conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles and incubated with beta cell line, βTC-6. Cell proliferation marker Ki67 was evaluated. Expression of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is one of the direct targets of miR-216a, was analyzed using western blot. For in vivo study, the miR-216a mimics/inhibitors conjugated to the nanoparticles were injected into 12-week-old female diabetic Balb/c mice via pancreatic duct. The delivery of the nanodrug was monitored by in vivo MRI. Blood glucose of the treated mice was monitored post injection. Ex vivo histological analysis of the pancreatic sections included staining for insulin, PTEN and Ki67. miRNA microarray demonstrated that the expression of miR-216a in the islets from NOD mice significantly changed during T1D progression. In vitro studies showed that treatment with a miR-216a inhibitor nanodrug suppressed proliferation of beta cells and increased the expression of PTEN, a miR-216a target. In contrast, introduction of a mimic nanodrug decreased PTEN expression and increased beta cell proliferation. Animals treated in vivo with a mimic nanodrug had higher insulin-producing functionality compared to controls. These observations were in line with downregulation of PTEN and increase in beta cell proliferation in that group. Our studies demonstrated that miR-216a could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. miR-216a-targeting theranostic nanodrugs served as exploratory tools to define functionality of this miRNA in conjunction with in vivo MR imaging."
"Breast cancer is one of the major female health problems worldwide. Although there is growing evidence indicating that air pollution increases the risk of breast cancer, there is still inconsistency among previous studies. Unlike the previous studies those had case-control or cohort study designs, we performed a nationwide, whole-population census study. In all 252 administrative districts in South Korea, the associations between ambient NO2 and particulate matter 10 (PM10) concentration, and age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate in females (from 2005 to 2016, Nmortality = 23,565), and incidence rate (from 2004 to 2013, Nincidence = 133,373) were investigated via multivariable beta regression. Population density, altitude, rate of higher education, smoking rate, obesity rate, parity, unemployment rate, breastfeeding rate, oral contraceptive usage rate, and Gross Regional Domestic Product per capita were considered as potential confounders. Ambient air pollutant concentrations were positively and significantly associated with the breast cancer incidence rate: per 100 ppb CO increase, Odds Ratio OR = 1.08 (95% Confidence Interval CI = 1.06–1.10), per 10 ppb NO2, OR = 1.14 (95% CI = 1.12–1.16), per 1 ppb SO2, OR = 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02–1.05), per 10 µg/m3 PM10, OR = 1.13 (95% CI = 1.09–1.17). However, no significant association between the air pollutants and the breast cancer mortality rate was observed except for PM10: per 10 µg/m3 PM10, OR = 1.05 (95% CI = 1.01–1.09)."
"Despite the promising value of miRNAs in the diagnostic and prognostic of cardiovascular disease (CVD), recent meta-analyses did not support their potential. Methodological variances in studies may interfere with miRNA profile and affect their results. This study determines if the blood starting material is a source of variance in miRNA profile by performing a paired comparison in plasma and serum of the expression of primary miRNAs associated with CVD. Circulating miRNA yield was similar in both plasma and serum, although a significant increase was observed in patients with Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) compared to control volunteers. When normalized by the expression of miR-484, different patterns of miRNA expression between serum and plasma. Although NSTEMI modified the expression of miR-1 and miR-208 in both serum and plasma, plasma displayed a higher variance than serum (Levene’s test p < 0.01). For miR-133a and miR-26a, differences were only detected in serum (p = 0.0240), and conversely, miR-499a showed differences only in plasma of NSTEMI (p = 0.001). Interestingly, miR-21 showed an opposite pattern of expression, being increased in serum (2−ΔΔCt: 5.7, p = 0.0221) and decreased in plasma (2−ΔΔCt: 0.5, p = 0.0107). Plasma and serum exhibit different patterns of circulating miRNA expression in NSTEMI and suggest that results from studies with different starting material could not be comparable."
"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common kidney cancer. Prognosis for ccRCC is generally poor since it is largely resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. Many studies suggested that cancer stem cells/tumor initiating cells (CSCs/TICs) are responsible for development of tumor, disease progression, aggressiveness, metastasis and drug resistance. However, tumorigenic potential of CSCs/TICs isolated from established RCC cell lines – basic ccRCC research model – has never been investigated in vivo. CD105+, CD105−, CD44+ and CD44− as well as CD44−/CD105− CD44+/CD105+ and CD44−/CD105+ cells were isolated from Caki-1 RCC cell line, confirming coexistence of multiple subpopulations of stem-related phenotype in stable cell line. Sorted cells were injected subcutaneously into NOD SCID mice and tumor growth was monitored with MRI and PET/CT. Tumor growth was observed after implantation of CD105+, CD44+, CD44−, CD44−/CD105+ and CD44−/CD105− but not CD105− or CD44+/CD105+. Implantation of CD44−/CD105− cells induced tumors that were characterized by longer T1 and distinct metabolic pattern than other tumors. All the tumors were characterized by low uptake of [18F]FDG. CD105+ and CD44− tumors expresses Nanog and Oct-4, while CD44− tumors additionally expressed endothelial cell marker - CD31."
"To describe the 25-year surgical trends, long-term outcomes and risk factors affecting the outcomes of giant retinal tear-related rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (GRT-RRD). Patients’ demographics, pre-operative characteristics, risk factors, operative procedures and post-operative outcomes were collected and divided into three groups – Group A: 1991 to 2015 (overall); Group B: 1991 to 2005, and Group C: 2006 to 2015. Functional and anatomical successes were monitored over a 5-year period. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors related to functional and anatomical success.127 eyes of 127 patients were included in the study. At 5th year, 69.4% patients had visual acuity (VA) < logMAR 1.0 with 87.5% primary anatomical success rate. While the functional outcome remained the same between group B and C, there was an increase in the anatomical success from 89.7% to 100%, albeit not statistically significant. Patients with worse presenting VA, 150 degrees or more of giant retina tear, macula-detached status and presence of PVR were associated with VA of> logMAR 1.0 (all p < 0.05). The types of surgery (TPPV vs combined SB/TPPV), number of breaks, lens extraction and additional cryotherapy were not associated with the functional or anatomical success. In conclusion, the GRT-RRD functional and structural outcomes were comparable between 1991–2005 and 2006–2015, albeit a statistically insignificant improvement of anatomical outcome over the past 25 years. Worse presenting VA, 150 degrees or more of giant retinal tear, detached macula and presence of PVR were associated with poorer visual outcome."
"Emerging evidence has suggested the association of the gut microbiome with some human diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we analyzed the gut microbiota from a cohort of healthy and diabetic Chinese individuals from Northern China. Pyrosequencing of the V4V5 region of 16S rRNA genes revealed a significant decrease in the gut microbiota diversity of diabetic patients as compared to healthy individuals. Butyrate-producing bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia were significantly decreased in diabetic patients. Furthermore, the abundance of Dorea was significantly increased in T2D individuals and negatively correlated with the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. The increase of Dorea could play a role in the development of T2D and has been previously overlooked. Importantly, functional analysis of the gut microbiome revealed for the first time that increased levels of butyrate production via transferases and the degradation of several amino acids due to gut microbial metabolism have strong correlations with T2D in Northern China. Moreover, the potential of gut microbiota-based classifiers to identify individuals with a high risk for T2D has been demonstrated in this study. Taken together, our findings have revealed a previously unappreciated association of the gut microbiome with T2D and have also suggested that changes in gut microbiota may be used to identify individuals at high risk for T2D."
"Tumours depend on nutrients supplied by the host for their growth and survival. Modifications to the host’s diet can change nutrient availability in the tumour microenvironment, which might represent a promising strategy for inhibiting tumour growth. Dietary modifications can limit tumour-specific nutritional requirements, alter certain nutrients that target the metabolic vulnerabilities of the tumour, or enhance the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs. Recent reports have suggested that modification of several nutrients in the diet can alter the efficacy of cancer therapies, and some of the newest developments in this quickly expanding field are reviewed here. The results discussed indicate that the dietary habits and nutritional state of a patient must be taken into account during cancer research and therapy."
"Clinical studies have reported that teriparatide (TPTD), a human parathyroid hormone analog, reduces back pain in osteoporotic patients. However, the mechanistic insights of this pharmacological action remain elusive. This study investigated the antinociceptive effect of TPTD mainly on primary sensory neurons in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The plantar test showed thermal hyperalgesia in the OVX rats, which was significantly, but not fully, recovered immediately after the initial TPTD administration. The von Frey test also demonstrated reduced withdrawal threshold in the OVX rats. This was partially recovered by TPTD. Consistently, the number and size of spinal microglial cells were significantly increased in the OVX rats, while TPTD treatment significantly reduced the number but not size of these cells. RNA sequencing-based bioinformatics of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) demonstrated that changes in neuro-protective and inflammatory genes were involved in the pharmacological effect of TPTD. Most neurons in the DRG expressed substantial levels of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor. TPTD treatment of the cultured DRG-derived neuronal cells reduced the cAMP level and augmented the intracellular calcium level as the concentration increased. These findings suggest that TPTD targets neuronal cells as well as bone cells to exert its pharmacological action."
"Although the malfunction of HtrA2/Omi leads to Parkinson’s disease (PD), the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we showed that HtrA2/Omi specifically removed oligomeric α-Syn but not monomeric α-Syn to protect oligomeric α-Syn-induced neurodegeneration. Experiments using mnd2 mice indicated that HtrA2/Omi degraded oligomeric α-Syn specifically without affecting monomers. Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster experiments of the co-expression α-Syn and HtrA2/Omi and expression of genes individually also confirmed that pan-neuronal expression of HtrA2/Omi completely rescued Parkinsonism in the α-Syn-induced PD Drosophila model by specifically removing oligomeric α-Syn. HtrA2/Omi maintained the health and integrity of the brain and extended the life span of transgenic flies. Because HtrA2/Omi specifically degraded oligomeric α-Syn, co-expression of HtrA2/Omi and α-Syn in Drosophila eye maintained a healthy retina, while the expression of α-Syn induced retinal degeneration. This work showed that the bacterial function of HtrA to degrade toxic misfolded proteins is evolutionarily conserved in mammalian brains as HtrA2/Omi."
"Preterm infants are increasingly diagnosed as having “extrauterine growth restriction” (EUGR) or “postnatal growth failure” (PGF). Usually EUGR/PGF is diagnosed when weight is <10th percentile at either discharge or 36–40 weeks postmenstrual age. The reasons why the phrases EUGR/PGF are unhelpful include, they: (i) are not predictive of adverse outcome; (ii) are based only on weight without any consideration of head or length growth, proportionality, body composition, or genetic potential; (iii) ignore normal postnatal weight loss; (iv) are usually assessed prior to growth slowing of the reference fetus, around 36–40 weeks, and (v) are usually based on an arbitrary statistical growth percentile cut-off. Focus on EUGR/PGF prevalence may benefit with better attention to nutrition but may also harm with nutrition delivery above infants’ actual needs. In this paper, we highlight challenges associated with such arbitrary cut-offs and opportunities for further refinement of understanding growth and nutritional needs of preterm neonates."
"The life history pattern of recent humans is uniquely derived in many of its aspects including an extended post-reproductive lifespan combined with short interbirth intervals. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of this unusual pattern. However most have been difficult to test due to the fragmentary nature of the hominin fossil record and the lack of methods capable of inferring such later life history events. In search of a method we tested the hypothesis that the physiologically impactful events of parturition and menopause are recorded in dental cementum microstructure. We performed histomorphological analyses of 47 teeth from 15 individuals with known life history events and were able to detect reproductive events and menopause in all females. Furthermore, we found that other stressful events such as systemic illnesses and incarceration are also detectable. Finally, through the development of a novel analytical method we were able to time all such events with high accuracy (R-squared = 0.92)."
"The cerebellum is connected to numerous regions of the contralateral side of the cerebrum. Motor and cognitive deficits following neonatal cerebellar hemorrhages (CbH) in extremely preterm neonates may be related to remote cortical alterations, following disrupted cerebello-cerebral connectivity as was previously shown within six CbH infants. In this retrospective case series study, we used MRI and advanced surface-based analyses to reconstruct gray matter (GM) changes in cortical thickness and cortical surface area in extremely preterm neonates (median age = 26; range: 24.9–26.7 gestational weeks) with large isolated unilateral CbH (N = 5 patients). Each CbH infant was matched with their own preterm infant cohort (range: 20–36 infants) based on sex and gestational age at birth. On a macro level, our data revealed that the contralateral cerebral hemisphere of CbH neonates did not show less cortical thickness or cortical surface area than their ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere at term. None of the cases differed from their matched cohort groups in average cortical thickness or average cortical surface area in the ipsilateral or contralateral cerebral hemisphere. On a micro (i.e. vertex) level, we established high variability in significant local cortical GM alteration patterns across case-cohort groups, in which the cases showed thicker or bigger volume in some regions, among which the caudal middle frontal gyrus, insula and parahippocampal gyrus, and thinner or less volume in other regions, among which the cuneus, precuneus and supratentorial gyrus. This study highlights that cerebellar injury during postnatal stages may have  widespread bilateral influence on the early maturation of cerebral cortical regions, which implicate complex cerebello-cerebral interactions to be present at term birth."
"c-MET receptors are activated in cancers through genomic events like tyrosine kinase domain mutations, juxtamembrane splicing mutation and amplified copy numbers, which can be inhibited by c-MET small molecule inhibitors. Here, we discover that the most common polymorphism known to affect MET gene (N375S), involving the semaphorin domain, confers exquisite binding affinity for HER2 and enables METN375S to interact with HER2 in a ligand-independent fashion. The resultant METN375S/HER2 dimer transduces potent proliferative, pro-invasive and pro-metastatic cues through the HER2 signaling axis to drive aggressive squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and lung (LUSC), and is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, HER2 blockers, but not c-MET inhibitors, are paradoxically effective at restraining in vivo and in vitro models expressing METN375S. These results establish METN375S as a biologically distinct and clinically actionable molecular subset of SCCs that are uniquely amenable to HER2 blocking therapies."
"Phenotypic heterogeneity exists within collectively invading packs of tumor cells, suggesting that cellular subtypes cooperate to drive invasion and metastasis. Here, we take a chemical biology approach to probe cell:cell cooperation within the collective invasion pack. These data reveal metabolic heterogeneity within invasive chains, in which leader cells preferentially utilize mitochondrial respiration and trailing follower cells rely on elevated glucose uptake. We define a pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) dependency in leader cells that can be therapeutically exploited with the mitochondria-targeting compound alexidine dihydrochloride. In contrast, follower cells highly express glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which sustains an elevated level of glucose uptake required to maintain proliferation. Co-targeting of both leader and follower cells with PDH and GLUT1 inhibitors, respectively, inhibits cell growth and collective invasion. Taken together, our work reveals metabolic heterogeneity within the lung cancer collective invasion pack and provides rationale for co-targeting PDH and GLUT1 to inhibit collective invasion."
"Deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics data from mixed cell populations is vital to identify the cellular mechanism of complex diseases. Existing deconvolution approaches can be divided into two major groups: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised deconvolution methods use cell type-specific prior information including cell proportions, reference cell type-specific gene signatures, or marker genes for each cell type, which may not be available in practice. Unsupervised methods, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM), in contrast, completely disregard prior information and thus are not efficient for data with partial cell type-specific information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deconvolution method, semi-CAM, that extends CAM by utilizing marker information from partial cell types. Analysis of simulation and two benchmark data have demonstrated that semi-CAM outperforms CAM by yielding more accurate cell proportion estimations when markers from partial/all cell types are available. In addition, when markers from all cell types are available, semi-CAM achieves better or similar accuracy compared to the supervised method using signature genes, CIBERSORT, and the marker-based supervised methods semi-NMF and DSA. Furthermore, analysis of human chlamydia-infection data with bulk expression profiles from six cell types and prior marker information of only three cell types suggests that semi-CAM achieves more accurate cell proportion estimations than CAM."
"Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) is only identified by amniocentesis, an invasive procedure that limits its clinical translation. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether the vaginal metabolome discriminates the presence/absence of MIAC in women with preterm labor (PTL) and intact membranes. We conducted a case-control study in women with symptoms of PTL below 34 weeks who underwent amniocentesis to discard MIAC. MIAC was defined as amniotic fluid positive for microorganisms identified by specific culture media. The cohort included 16 women with MIAC and 16 control (no MIAC). Both groups were matched for age and gestational age at admission. Vaginal fluid samples were collected shortly after amniocentesis. Metabolic profiles were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and compared using multivariate and univariate statistical analyses to identify significant differences between the two groups. The vaginal metabolomics profile of MIAC showed higher concentrations of hypoxanthine, proline, choline and acetylcholine and decreased concentrations of phenylalanine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine and glycerophosphocholine. In conclusion, metabolic changes in the NMR-based vaginal metabolic profile are able to discriminate the presence/absence of MIAC in women with PTL and intact membranes. These metabolic changes might be indicative of enhanced glycolysis triggered by hypoxia conditions as a consequence of bacterial infection, thus explaining the utilization of alternative energy sources in an attempt to replenish glucose."
"Traumatic injury of peripheral nerves typically also damages nerve surrounding tissue including muscles. Hence, molecular and cellular interactions of neighboring damaged tissues might be decisive for successful axonal regeneration of injured nerves. So far, the contribution of muscles and muscle-derived molecules to peripheral nerve regeneration has only poorly been studied. Herein, we conditionally ablated SRF (serum response factor), an important myofiber transcription factor, in skeletal muscles of mice. Subsequently, the impact of this myofiber-restricted SRF deletion on peripheral nerve regeneration, i.e. facial nerve injury was analyzed. Quantification of facial nerve regeneration by retrograde tracer transport, inspection of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and recovery of whisker movement revealed reduced axonal regeneration upon muscle specific Srf deletion. In contrast, responses in brainstem facial motor neuron cell bodies such as regeneration-associated gene (RAG) induction of Atf3, synaptic stripping and neuroinflammation were not overly affected by SRF deficiency. Mechanistically, SRF in myofibers appears to stimulate nerve regeneration through regulation of muscular satellite cell (SC) proliferation. In summary, our data suggest a role of muscle cells and SRF expression within muscles for regeneration of injured peripheral nerves."
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a well-accepted tool for noninvasive thermal therapy. To control the quality of HIFU treatment, the focal spot generated in tissues must be localized. Ultrasound imaging can monitor heated regions; in particular, the change in backscattered energy (CBE) allows parametric imaging to visualize thermal information in the tissue. Conventional CBE imaging constructed in the spatial domain may be easily affected by noises when the HIFU focal spot is visualized. This study proposes frequency-domain CBE imaging to improve noise tolerance and image contrast in HIFU focal spot monitoring. Phantom experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled environment. HIFU of 2.12 MHz was applied to the phantoms, during which a clinical scanner equipped with a 3-MHz convex array transducer was used to collect raw image data consisting of backscattered signals for B-mode, spatial-, and frequency-domain CBE imaging. Concurrently, temperature changes were measured at the focal spot using a thermocouple for comparison with CBE values by calculating the correlation coefficient r. To further analyze CBE image contrast levels, a contrast factor was introduced, and an independent t-test was performed to calculate the probability value p. Experimental results showed that frequency-domain CBE imaging performed well in thermal distribution visualization, enabling quantitative detection of temperature changes. The CBE value calculated in the frequency domain also correlated strongly with that obtained using the conventional spatial-domain approach (r = 0.97). In particular, compared with the image obtained through the conventional method, the contrast of the CBE image obtained using the method based on frequency-domain analysis increased by 2.5-fold (4 dB; p < 0.05). Frequency-domain computations may constitute a new strategy when ultrasound CBE imaging is used to localize the focal spot in HIFU treatment planning."
"Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world. Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere. To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports. All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history. The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making."
"Bouillon cubes are widely consumed and when fortified with iron could contribute in preventing iron deficiency. We report the development (part I) and evaluation (current part II) of a novel ferric phytate compound to be used as iron fortificant in condiments such as bouillon. Ferric pyrophosphate (FePP), is the compound of choice due to its high stability in foods, but has a modest absorption in humans. Our objective was to assess iron bioavailability from a novel iron fortificant consisting of ferric iron complexed with phytic acid and hydrolyzed corn protein (Fe-PA-HCP), used in bouillon with and without an inhibitory food matrix. In a randomised single blind, cross-over study, we measured iron absorption in healthy adult women (n = 22). In vitro iron bioaccessibility was assessed using a Caco-2 cell model. Iron absorption from Fe-PA-HCP was 1.5% and 4.1% in bouillon with and without inhibitory matrix, respectively. Relative iron bioavailability to FeSO4 was 2.4 times higher than from FePP in bouillon (17% vs 7%) and 5.2 times higher when consumed with the inhibitory meal (41% vs 8%). Similar results were found in vitro. Fe-PA-HCP has a higher relative bioavailability versus FePP, especially when bouillon is served with an inhibitory food matrix."
"The Spectrum-STI model, structured by sub-groups within a population, was used in a workshop in Yunnan, China, to estimate provincial trends in active syphilis in 15 to 49-year-old adults. Syphilis prevalence data from female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and lower-risk women and men in Yunnan were identified through literature searches and local experts. Sources included antenatal care clinic screening, blood donor screening, HIV/STI bio-behavioural surveys, sentinel surveillance, and epidemiology studies. The 2017 provincial syphilis prevalence estimates were 0.26% (95% confidence interval 0.17–0.34%) in women and 0.28% (0.20–0.36%) in men. Estimated prevalence was 6.8-fold higher in FSW (1.69% (0.68–3.97%) than in lower-risk women (0.25% (0.18–0.35%)), and 22.7-fold higher in MSM (5.35% (2.74–12.47%) than in lower-risk men (0.24% (0.17–0.31%). For all populations, the 2017 estimates were below the 2005 estimates, but differences were not significant. In 2017 FSW and MSM together accounted for 9.3% of prevalent cases. These estimates suggest Yunnan’s STI programs have kept the overall prevalence of syphilis low, but prevalence remains high in FSW and MSM. Strengthening efforts targeting FSW and MSM, and identification of other risk populations e.g. among heterosexual men, are critical to reduce syphilis."
"Nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostics is known as one of the molecular diagnostic systems that allows higher sensitive detection of pathogens than test methods such as immunoassay. However, it has not been widely used because it is complicated to use and takes a long time to generate results. On the other hand, development of fully automated molecular diagnostic systems has been growing around the world as demand for such systems from physicians and laboratory technicians has increased. To meet this demand, we have developed the “Simprova” fully automated molecular diagnostic system, which takes advantage of LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), a method Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. invented. Simprova comprises a master unit that controls the entire system and a test unit that extracts and purifies nucleic acid from samples (pretreatment), and uses the LAMP method to detect and amplify nucleic acid. Users can obtain test results automatically by simply installing a pretreatment cartridge, a multi-well testing chip and the sample in the test unit. The multi-well testing chip has 25 reaction wells connected by channels and enables simultaneous testing of multiple targets with one sample. Turnaround time for one test is approximately 30 minutes. Since a conventional extraction and purification method using magnetic-bead separation is used for the pretreatment, nucleic acid can be extracted from serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, and sputum, for example. In addition, the system can perform random-access testing by connecting four test units to the master unit to realize near-the-patient testing. Simprova is therefore a robust and useful system for a wide variety of applications."
"The relationship between alcohol consumption and sleep disturbance is complex. The association of alcohol dependence with insomnia is likely to be bidirectional in nature. Alcohol use is common among older people in many societies and the prevalence of insomnia tends to increase with age, therefore this group warrants particular consideration. We explored the cross sectional and long term (30 years) associations between alcohol drinking (volume and hazardous drinking) and sleep duration and insomnia in a general population study of older adults (6,117 male and female civil servants followed for 30 years). For men, drinking more than 21 units (approximately 168 grams) of alcohol per week, compared with not drinking, was associated with waking several times a night (odds ratio 1.30, confidence intervals 1.02–1.66). Men who maintained a heavy volume of drinking over the three decades of observation, or who had an unstable consumption pattern, tended to have worse sleep profiles in terms of waking tired and waking several times. Sustained male hazardous drinking (as measured by the AUDIT-C scale) was also associated with worse sleep profiles. Findings for women were not so clear. In this population based setting, drinking high volumes of alcohol may contribute to the prevalence of sleep problems in older age, particularly for men. People in this age group should be discouraged from using alcohol as a sleep aid."
"Microcirculatory disorders are crucial in pathophysiology of organ dysfunction in critical illness. Evaluation of sublingual microcirculation is not routinely conducted in daily practice due to time-consuming analysis and susceptibility to artifacts. We investigated the suitability of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for contactless evaluation of sublingual microcirculation. Sublingual microcirculation was imaged in 10 healthy volunteers, using an OCTA device and an incident dark field (IDF) illumination microscopy (current gold standard). OCTA images were analyzed with regard to flow density and perfused vessel density (PVDbyOCTA). IDF videos were analyzed following current recommendations. Flow density was automatically extracted from OCTA images (whole en face 48.9% [43.2; 54.5]; central ring 52.6% [43.6; 60.6]). PVDbyOCTA did not differ from the PVD calculated from IDF videos (PVDbyOCTA 18.6 mm/mm² [18.0; 21.7]) vs. PVDbyIDF 21.0 mm/mm² [17.5; 22.9]; p = 0.430). Analysis according to Bland-Altman revealed a mean bias of 0.95 mm/mm² (95% Confidence interval −1.34 to 3.25) between PVDbyOCTA and PVDbyIDF with limits of agreement of −5.34 to 7.24 mm/mm². This study is the first to demonstrate the suitability of OCTA for evaluating sublingual microcirculation. Comparison of the perfused vessel density between methods showed a plausible level of agreement."
"Lethal total body irradiation (TBI) triggers multifactorial health issues in a potentially short time frame. Hence, early signatures of TBI would be of great clinical value. Our study aimed to interrogate microRNA (miRNA) and metabolites, two biomolecules available in blood serum, in order to comprehend the immediate impacts of TBI. Mice were exposed to a lethal dose (9.75 Gy) of Cobalt-60 gamma radiation and euthanized at four time points, namely, days 1, 3, 7 and 9 post-TBI. Serum miRNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina small RNA sequencing protocol, and metabolites were screened using a mass spectrometer. The degree of early impacts of irradiation was underscored by the large number of miRNAs and metabolites that became significantly expressed during the Early phase (day 0 and 1 post-TBI). Radiation-induced inflammatory markers for bone marrow aplasia and pro-sepsis markers showed early elevation with longitudinal increment. Functional analysis integrating miRNA-protein-metabolites revealed inflammation as the overarching host response to lethal TBI. Early activation of the network linked to the synthesis of reactive oxygen species was associated with the escalated regulation of the fatty acid metabolism network. In conclusion, we assembled a list of time-informed critical markers and mechanisms of significant translational potential in the context of a radiation exposure event."
"Heart transplantation remains the definitive therapy of end-stage heart failure. Ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring during transplantation is a primary determinant of long-term outcome of heart transplantation and primary graft insufficiency. Modification of the nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway appears to be one of the most promising among the pharmacological interventional options. We aimed at characterizing the cardio-protective effects of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat in a rat model of heterotopic heart transplantation. Donor Lewis rats were treated orally with either riociguat or placebo for two days (n = 9) in each transplanted group and (n = 7) in donor groups. Following explantation, hearts were heterotopically transplanted. After one hour reperfusion, left ventricular pressure-volume relations and coronary blood flow were recorded. Molecular biological measurements and histological examination were also completed. Left ventricular contractility (systolic pressure: 117 ± 13 vs. 48 ± 5 mmHg, p < 0.001; dP/dtmax: 2963 ± 221 vs. 1653 ± 159 mmHg/s, p < 0.001), active relaxation (dP/dtmin: −2014 ± 305 vs. −1063 ± 177 mmHg/s, p = 0.02; all at 120 µl of left ventricular volume), and alteration of coronary blood flow standardized to heart weight (2.55 ± 0.32 vs. 1.67 ± 0.22 ml/min/g, p = 0.03) were markedly increased following preconditioning with riociguat. Myocardial apoptosis markers were also significantly reduced in the riociguat pretreated group as well as the antioxidant markers were elevated. Pharmacological preconditioning with riociguat decreases ischemia-reperfusion injury and improves donor organ function in our animal model of heart transplantation. Therefore, riociguat might be a potential cardioprotective agent."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal disease of unknown etiology; however, apoptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells plays a role in disease progression. This intractable disease is associated with increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in the lungs, yet their roles in disease pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report that Staphylococcus nepalensis releases corisin, a peptide conserved in diverse staphylococci, to induce apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. The disease in mice exhibits acute exacerbation after intrapulmonary instillation of corisin or after lung infection with corisin-harboring S. nepalensis compared to untreated mice or mice infected with bacteria lacking corisin. Correspondingly, the lung corisin levels are significantly increased in human IPF patients with acute exacerbation compared to patients without disease exacerbation. Our results suggest that bacteria shedding corisin are involved in acute exacerbation of IPF, yielding insights to the molecular basis for the elevation of staphylococci in pulmonary fibrosis."
"Accelerated telomere attrition is related to various diseases, and multiple factors have been reported to influence telomere length. However, little attention has focused on the relationship between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length in the US general population. A total of 7,817 participants from the 1999–2002 NHANES were included. The association between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length was investigated using regression models. A remarkably positive relationship between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length emerged after adjustments were made for covariates. The adjusted β coefficient of serum phosphate levels for mean telomere length was 0.038 (95% confidence intervals (CIs), 0.022 to 0.095, p = 0.002). A longer telomere length was observed in participants with serum phosphate levels in the highest quartiles, and a dose-dependent association was observed. Our study demonstrated that higher quartiles of phosphate had a remarkable correlation with longer telomere length."
"A distinct bioenergetic impairment of heart mitochondrial subpopulations in diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with obesity; however, many type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with high-risk for cardiovascular disease are not obese. In the absence of obesity, it is unclear whether bioenergetic function in the subpopulations of mitochondria is affected in heart with T2DM. To address this issue, a rat model of non-obese T2DM was used to study heart mitochondrial energy metabolism, measuring bioenergetics and enzyme activities of the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of substrates for ETC and ETC activities in both populations of heart mitochondria in T2DM rats were unchanged. Despite the preservation of mitochondrial function, aconitase activity in T2DM heart was reduced, suggesting oxidative stress in mitochondria. Our study indicate that metabolic function of heart mitochondria is unchanged in the face of oxidative stress and point to a critical role of obesity in T2DM cardiomyopathy."
"A 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation is extended to study mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from healthy control (HC) using the joint human connectome project multi-modal parcellation (JHCPMMP) proposed by us. We propose a novel classification method named as JMMP-LRR to accurately identify different stages toward AD by integrating the JHCPMMP with the logistic regression-recursive feature elimination (LR-RFE). In three-group classification, the average accuracy is 89.0% for HC, MCI, and AD compared to previous studies using other cortical separation with the best classification accuracy of 81.5%. By counting the number of brain regions whose feature is in the feature subset selected with JMMP-LRR, we find that five brain areas often appear in the selected features. The five core brain areas are Fusiform Face Complex (L-FFC), Area 10d (L-10d), Orbital Frontal Complex (R-OFC), Perirhinal Ectorhinal (L-PeEc) and Area TG dorsal (L-TGd, R-TGd). The features corresponding to the five core brain areas are used to form a new feature subset for three classifications with the average accuracy of 80.0%. Results demonstrate the importance of the five core brain regions in identifying different stages toward AD. Experiment results show that the proposed method has better accuracy for the classification of HC, MCI, AD, and it also proves that the division of brain regions using JHCPMMP is more scientific and effective than other methods."
"Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women and the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Although in recent years large-scale efforts have focused on identifying new therapeutic targets, a better understanding of BC molecular processes is required. Here we focused on elucidating the molecular hallmarks of BC heterogeneity and the oncogenic mutations involved in precision medicine that remains poorly defined. To fill this gap, we established an OncoOmics strategy that consists of analyzing genomic alterations, signaling pathways, protein-protein interactome network, protein expression, dependency maps in cell lines and patient-derived xenografts in 230 previously prioritized genes to reveal essential genes in breast cancer. As results, the OncoOmics BC essential genes were rationally filtered to 140. mRNA up-regulation was the most prevalent genomic alteration. The most altered signaling pathways were associated with basal-like and Her2-enriched molecular subtypes. RAC1, AKT1, CCND1, PIK3CA, ERBB2, CDH1, MAPK14, TP53, MAPK1, SRC, RAC3, BCL2, CTNNB1, EGFR, CDK2, GRB2, MED1 and GATA3 were essential genes in at least three OncoOmics approaches. Drugs with the highest amount of clinical trials in phases 3 and 4 were paclitaxel, docetaxel, trastuzumab, tamoxifen and doxorubicin. Lastly, we collected ~3,500 somatic and germline oncogenic variants associated with 50 essential genes, which in turn had therapeutic connectivity with 73 drugs. In conclusion, the OncoOmics strategy reveals essential genes capable of accelerating the development of targeted therapies for precision oncology."
"The cardiac work-loop technique closely mimics the intrinsic in vivo movement and characteristics of cardiac muscle function. In this study, six known inotropes were profiled using the work-loop technique to evaluate the potential of this method to predict inotropy. Papillary muscles from male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted onto an organ bath perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Following optimisation, work-loop contractions were performed that included an initial stabilisation period followed by vehicle control or drug administration. Six known inotropes were tested: digoxin, dobutamine, isoprenaline, flecainide, verapamil and atenolol. Muscle performance was evaluated by calculating power output during work-loop contraction. Digoxin, dobutamine and isoprenaline caused a significant increase in power output of muscles when compared to vehicle control. Flecainide, verapamil and atenolol significantly reduced power output of muscles. These changes in power output were reflected in alterations in work loop shapes. This is the first study in which changes in work-loop shape detailing for example the activation, shortening or passive re-lengthening have been linked to the mechanism of action of a compound. This study has demonstrated that the work-loop technique can provide an important novel method with which to assess detailed mechanisms of drug-induced effects on cardiac muscle contractility."
"Somatic gene therapies may be authorised for marketing in the EU under the advanced therapy medicinal product regulation. These therapeutic compounds are sufficiently novel and complex in their potential effects to require specialist evaluation. However, the current definition of gene therapy medicinal products (‘GTMP’) risks excluding molecules which are not manufactured through techniques involving recombination. We consider the way, in which the ‘recombinant nucleic acid’ aspect of the GTMP definition is challenged by developments in gene-editing technology, and why a broader scope of GTMP regulation may be desirable."
"Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) testing in cattle requires a significant investment of time, equipment, and labor. Novel, rapid, cheaper and accurate methods are needed. The Alere Determine TB lipoarabinomannan antigen (LAM-test) is a World Health Organization-endorsed point-of-care urine test designed to detect active TB disease in humans. The Lionex Animal TB Rapid Test (Lionex-test) is a novel animal specific TB diagnostic blood test. An animal level analysis was performed using urine (n = 141) and milk (n = 63) samples from depopulated BTB-suspected cattle to test the accuracy of the LAM-test when compared to results of positive TB detection by any routine BTB tests (BOVIGAM, necropsy, histology, culture, PCR) that are regularly performed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The agreement between the urine LAM-test and USDA standard tests were poor at varying testing time points. The same milk samples did not elicit statistically significant agreement with the Lionex-test, although positive trends were present. Hence, we cannot recommend the LAM-test as a valid BTB diagnostic test in cattle using either urine or milk. The Lionex-test’s production of positive trends using milk samples suggests larger sample sizes may validate the Lionex-test in accurately diagnosing BTB in cattle using milk samples, potentially providing a quick and reliable field test for BTB."
"Muography is a novel method of visualizing the internal structures of active volcanoes by using high-energy near-horizontally arriving cosmic muons. The purpose of this study is to show the feasibility of muography to forecast the eruption event with the aid of the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this study, seven daily consecutive muographic images were fed into the CNN to compute the probability of eruptions on the eighth day, and our CNN model was trained by hyperparameter tuning with the Bayesian optimization algorithm. By using the data acquired in Sakurajima volcano, Japan, as an example, the forecasting performance achieved a value of 0.726 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, showing the reasonable correlation between the muographic images and eruption events. Our result suggests that muography has the potential for eruption forecasting of volcanoes."
"There are few reports on the lymph nodes of entrance point to recurrent laryngeal nerve (LN-epRLN) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Thus, we investigated the clinical significance of LN-epRLN and implications it may have. An observational analysis of 878 consecutive patients with PTC who underwent thyroidectomy from April 2016 to March 2017 was conducted. We explored the surrounding tissue of laryngeal entry point, during routine central lymph node dissection (CLND). The lymph node specimens were sent separately for routine histopathological examination. Thereafter, complications and follow-ups were recorded. LN-epRLNs were found in 73 of the 878 patients, with the metastatic rate of 3.76%. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed central lymph node metastases can serve as independent predictors for LN-epRLN metastasis. In summary, we confirmed the significance of LN-epRLN in metastasis and recurrence, which required precise anatomy and thorough CLND. In PTC patients, especially in suspicious presence of central cervical lymph node metastasis, attention should be given to excising the nodal tissue at the laryngeal entry point."
"BackgroundIn 2018, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) issued revised recommendations for cancer prevention. We examined the relation between adherence to these recommendations and risk of total cancer in two population-based Swedish prospective cohorts (29,451 men and 25,349 women).MethodsStandardized-WCRF/AICR 2018 and simplified-WCRF/AICR 2018 adherence scores were constructed based on the WCRF/AICR recommendations for body weight, physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption and dietary supplement use. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire.ResultsDuring the 15.4 years of follow-up, 12,693 incident cancers were ascertained. The multivariable HR between extreme categories of the Standardized-WCRF/AICR 2018 score (4.1–7 vs. 0–2) was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.82–0.95) and for the Simplified score (5–8 vs. 0–2) was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.90); each 1-score increment in recommendation adherence was associated with 3% (95% CI = 1–5%) and 4% (95% CI = 2–5%) decreased risk, respectively. Based on the Simplified scoring, most participants (>90%) did not meet WCRF/AICR 2018 recommendations regarding consumption of plant foods, limited consumption of red/processed meat and ‘fast food’/processed food, and <50% of participants met the weight and physical activity recommendations.ConclusionsAdherence to the 2018WCRF/AICR recommendations substantially reduced the risk of total cancer. Given that many people do not meet the recommendations, there is a great potential for cancer prevention."
"Although a meta-analysis previously suggested a positive relationship between diabetes and intraocular pressure (IOP), the interrelationships among diabetes, IOP, and other ocular biometric parameters remain unclear. The present study investigated the relationships of diabetes, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and serum glucose with IOP and ocular hypertension (IOP > 21 mmHg) in non-glaucomatous Japanese adults living in Chikusei City. Diabetes was defined as a self-reported history of diabetes, the use of antidiabetic medication, or HbA1c levels ≥6.5%. Among 6,786 enrolled participants aged 40 years and above, 734 were classified as diabetic (10.8%). After adjusting for several confounders, the IOP values were significantly higher in participants with diabetes than in those without diabetes (14.4 ± 0.1 vs. 13.9 ± 0.1 mmHg, P < 0.001) and were also significantly increased in those with elevated HbA1c and serum glucose levels (both P < 0.001). Moreover, diabetes was significantly related to ocular hypertension (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.81; P < 0.05). The positive influence of diabetes with ocular hypertension was consistent even after adjustment for central corneal thickness. In conclusion, diabetes, elevated HbA1c, and increased serum glucose are significant contributing factors for elevated IOP."
"The PB2 gene is one of the key determinants for the mammalian adaptation of avian influenza A viruses (IAVs). Although mammalian pathogenicity-related mutations (MPMs) in PB2 genes were identified in different genetic backgrounds of avian IAVs, the relative effects of single or multiple mutations on viral fitness could not be directly compared. Furthermore, their mutational steps during mammalian adaptation had been unclear. In this study, we collectively compared the effects of individual and combined MPMs on viral fitness and determined their rank orders using a prototypic PB2 gene. Early acquired mutations may determine the function and potency of subsequent mutations and be important for recruiting multiple, competent combinations of MPMs. Higher mammalian pathogenicity was acquired with the greater accumulation of MPMs. Thus, the rank orders and the prototypic PB2 gene may be useful for predicting the present and future risks of PB2 genes of avian and mammalian IAVs."
"Procedure-related cardiac electronic implantable device (CIED) infections have high morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for infection prevention efforts to include electrophysiology procedures. We developed and validated a semi-automated algorithm based on structured electronic health records data to reliably identify CIED infections. A sample of CIED procedures entered into the Veterans’ Health Administration Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking program from FY 2008–2015 was reviewed for the presence of CIED infection. This sample was then randomly divided into training (2/3) validation sets (1/3). The training set was used to develop a detection algorithm containing structured variables mapped from the clinical pathways of CIED infection. Performance of this algorithm was evaluated using the validation set. 2,107 unique CIED procedures from a cohort of 5,753 underwent manual review; 97 CIED infections (4.6%) were identified. Variables strongly associated with true infections included presence of a microbiology order, billing codes for surgical site infections and post-procedural antibiotic prescriptions. The combined algorithm to detect infection demonstrated high c-statistic (0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.92–0.98), sensitivity (87.9%) and specificity (90.3%) in the validation data. Structured variables derived from clinical pathways can guide development of a semi-automated detection tool to surveil for CIED infection."
"Osteoclasts (OCs), cells specialized for bone resorption, are generated from monocyte/macrophage precursors by a differentiation process governed by RANKL. Here, we show that DCTN1, a key component of the dynactin complex, plays important roles in OC differentiation. The expression of DCTN1 was upregulated by RANKL. The inhibition of DCTN1 expression by gene knockdown suppressed OC formation, bone resorption, and the induction of NFATc1 and c-Fos, critical transcription factors for osteoclastogenesis. More importantly, the activation of Cdc42 by RANKL was inhibited upon DCTN1 silencing. The forced expression of constitutively active Cdc42 restored the OC differentiation of precursors with DCTN1 deletion. In addition, PAK2 was found to be activated by RANKL and to function downstream of Cdc42. The DCTN1-Cdc42 axis also inhibited apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of DCTN1 knockdown was verified in an animal model of bone erosion. Intriguingly, DCTN1 overexpression was also detrimental to OC differentiation, suggesting that DCTN1 should be regulated at the appropriate level for effective osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, our results reveal that DCTN1 participates in the activation of Cdc42/PAK2 signaling and the inhibition of apoptosis during osteoclastogenesis."
"BackgroundIntratumoural CD103+CD8+ T cells have been linked to prolonged survival in several malignancies. However, the clinical significance of CD103+CD8+ T cells in gastric cancer remains unexplored.MethodsGastric cancer tissues from Zhongshan Hospital and data from Gene Expression Omnibus were obtained and analysed. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were performed to detect the number and phenotypical characteristics of CD103+CD8+ T cells. The effect of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade on CD103+CD8+ T cells was evaluated with the use of an in vitro study based on fresh tumour tissues.ResultsCD103+CD8+ T cells predicted superior overall survival and provided better prognostic power than total CD8+ T cells in gastric cancer. Patients with high CD103+CD8+ T cell infiltration also gained more benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CD103+CD8+ T cells exerted superior anti-tumour effects with stronger retention capacity and cytotoxicity. Moreover, an in vitro study showed that CD103+CD8+ T cells were more functionally restored after PD-1 blockade than CD103-CD8+ T cells.ConclusionsCD103+CD8+ T cells might be a useful marker to predict prognosis and therapeutic efficacy for gastric cancer patients. Efforts to increase intratumoural CD103+CD8+ T cell frequency might be a novel therapeutic strategy in gastric cancer."
"A Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), is known to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancer types; however, whether DLC1 is a tumor-suppressor gene or an oncogene in melanoma remains to be clarified. Here we revealed that high DLC1 expression was detected in most of the melanoma tissues where it was localized in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. Functional studies unveiled that DLC1 was both required and sufficient for melanoma growth and metastasis. These tumorigenic events were mediated by nuclear-localized DLC1 in a RhoGAP-independent manner. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis identified a DLC1-associated protein, FOXK1 transcription factor, which mediated oncogenic events in melanoma by translocating and retaining DLC1 into the nucleus. RNA-sequencing profiling studies further revealed MMP9 as a direct target of FOXK1 through DLC1-regulated promoter occupancy for cooperative activation of MMP9 expression to promote melanoma invasion and metastasis. Concerted action of DLC1–FOXK1 in MMP9 gene regulation was further supported by their highly correlated expression in melanoma patients’ samples and cell lines. Together, our results not only unravel a mechanism by which nuclear DLC1 functions as an oncogene in melanoma but also suggest an unexpected role of RhoGAP protein in transcriptional regulation."
"Understanding a drug candidate’s pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters is a challenging but essential aspect of drug development. Investigating the penetration and distribution of a topical drug’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) allows for evaluating drug delivery and efficacy, which is necessary to ensure drug viability. A topical gel (BPX-05) was recently developed to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris by directly delivering the combination of the topical antibiotic minocycline and the retinoid tazarotene to the pilosebaceous unit of the dermis. In order to evaluate the uptake of APIs within human facial skin and confirm accurate drug delivery, a selective visualization method to monitor and quantify local drug distributions within the skin was developed. This approach uses fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) paired with a multicomponent phasor analysis algorithm to visualize drug localization. As minocycline and tazarotene have distinct fluorescence lifetimes from the lifetime of the skin’s autofluorescence, these two APIs are viable targets for distinct visualization via FLIM. Here, we demonstrate that the analysis of the resulting FLIM output can be used to determine local distributions of minocycline and tazarotene within the skin. This approach is generalizable and can be applied to many multicomponent fluorescence lifetime imaging targets that require cellular resolution and molecular specificity."
"In mice, the maternal microbiome influences fetal immune development and postnatal allergic outcomes. Westernized populations have high rates of allergic disease and low rates of gastrointestinal carriage of Prevotella, a commensal bacterial genus that produces short chain fatty acids and endotoxins, each of which may promote the development of fetal immune tolerance. In this study, we use a prebirth cohort (n = 1064 mothers) to conduct a nested case-cohort study comparing 58 mothers of babies with clinically proven food IgE mediated food allergy with 258 randomly selected mothers. Analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples shows maternal carriage of Prevotella copri during pregnancy strongly predicts the absence of food allergy in the offspring. This association was confirmed using targeted qPCR and was independent of infant carriage of P. copri. Larger household size, which is a well-established protective factor for allergic disease, strongly predicts maternal carriage of P. copri."
"We developed prognostic models for breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) that consider anatomic stage and other important determinants of prognosis and survival in breast cancer, such as age, grade, and receptor-based subtypes with the intention to demonstrate that these factors, conditional on stage, improve prediction of BCSS. A total of 20,928 patients with stage I–III invasive primary breast cancer treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1990 and 2016, who received surgery as an initial treatment were identified to generate prognostic models by Fine-Gray competing risk regression model. Model predictive accuracy was assessed using Harrell’s C-index. The Aalen–Johansen estimator and a selected Fine–Gray model were used to estimate the 5-year and 10-year BCSS probabilities. The performance of the selected model was evaluated by assessing discrimination and prediction calibration in an external validation dataset of 29,727 patients from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). The inclusion of age, grade, and receptor-based subtype in addition to stage significantly improved the model predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.774 (95% CI 0.755–0.794) vs. 0.692 for stage alone, p < 0.0001). Young age (<40), higher grade, and TNBC subtype were significantly associated with worse BCSS. The selected model showed good discriminative ability but poor calibration when applied to the validation data. After recalibration, the predictions showed good calibration in the training and validation data. More refined BCSS prediction is possible through a model that has been externally validated and includes clinical and biological factors."
"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is implicated in several cancers, including gastric cancer. However, limited data are available regarding its clinical significance in early gastric cancer (EGC). We evaluated the clinical significance of HER2 overexpression in patients with EGC. We retrospectively reviewed 727 patients who underwent surgical treatment for EGC between October 2010 and August 2017. HER2 expression was analysed in 680 EGC cases by immunohistochemistry and classified as negative (0 and 1+), equivocal (2+), or positive [overexpression (3+)]. Among patients with differentiated EGC, the number of patients with HER2 overexpression was not significantly different from that of HER2-negative patients in terms of age, sex, tumour size, location, gross type, depth of invasion, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, in patients with undifferentiated EGC, HER2 overexpression was significantly correlated with LVI and presence of LNM compared with HER2-negative patients. Multivariate analysis indicated HER2 overexpression as a good predictive marker of LNM in patients with undifferentiated EGC. HER2 expression is associated with LNM in undifferentiated EGC. Therefore, the importance of HER2 overexpression in EGC should not be overlooked, and further studies are needed to identify its clinical significance."
"Exercise training is a powerful means to combat metabolic diseases. Mice are extensively used to investigate the benefits of exercise, but mild cold stress induced by ambient housing temperatures may confound translation to humans. Thermoneutral housing is a strategy to make mice more metabolically similar to humans but its effects on exercise adaptations are unknown. Here we show that thermoneutral housing blunts exercise-induced improvements in insulin action in muscle and adipose tissue and reduces the effects of training on energy expenditure, body composition, and muscle and adipose tissue protein expressions. Thus, many reported effects of exercise training in mice are likely secondary to metabolic stress of ambient housing temperature, making it challenging to translate to humans. We conclude that adaptations to exercise training in mice critically depend upon housing temperature. Our findings underscore housing temperature as a critical parameter in the design and interpretation of murine exercise training studies."
"Early response to antipsychotic medications is one of the most important determinants of later symptomatic and functional outcomes in psychosis. Glutathione and glutamate have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for patients demonstrating inadequate response to dopamine-blocking antipsychotics. Nevertheless, the role of these neurochemicals in the mechanism of early antipsychotic response remains poorly understood. Using a longitudinal design and ultrahigh field 7-T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol in 53 subjects, we report the association between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex glutamate and glutathione, with time to treatment response in drug naive (34.6% of the sample) or minimally medicated first episode patients with schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder. Time to response was defined as the number of weeks required to reach a 50% reduction in the PANSS-8 scores. Higher glutathione was associated with shorter time to response (F = 4.86, P = 0.017), while higher glutamate was associated with more severe functional impairment (F = 5.33, P = 0.008). There were no significant differences between patients and controls on measures of glutamate or glutathione. For the first time, we have demonstrated an association between higher glutathione and favorable prognosis in FEP. We propose that interventions that increase brain glutathione levels may improve outcomes of early intervention in psychosis."
"Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus, and has been reported to be associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In most of the associated tumors, the virus remains in a latently infected state. During latency, EBV expresses Latent Membrane Protein 2A (LMP2A) along with few other genes. We previously showed that LMP2A causes downregulation of HLA-ABC surface expression in EBV associated gastric carcinomas. However, the mechanism that leads to this downregulation remain unclear. We therefore analyzed methylation-mediated regulation of HLA-ABC expression by LMP2A. Interestingly, according to the ‘missing self’ hypothesis, when there is a decrease in HLA-ABC surface expression, expression of NKG2D ligands’ must be upregulated to facilitate killing by Natural Killer (NK) cells. Analysis of NKG2D ligands’ expression, revealed downregulation of MIC-A/B surface expression in response to LMP2A. Furthermore, the role of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in the regulation of MIC-A/B surface expression in cells expressing LMP2A was also investigated. Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) mediated inhibition of MIC-A/B surface expression was observed in LMP2A expressing cells. Our current findings provide new insights in LMP2A arbitrated dysregulation of host immune response in epithelial cell carcinomas."
"Quantification of stillbirth risk has potential to support clinical decision-making. Studies that have attempted to quantify stillbirth risk have been hampered by small event rates, a limited range of predictors that typically exclude obstetric history, lack of validation, and restriction to a single classifier (logistic regression). Consequently, predictive performance remains low, and risk quantification has not been adopted into antenatal practice. The study population consisted of all births to women in Western Australia from 1980 to 2015, excluding terminations. After all exclusions there were 947,025 livebirths and 5,788 stillbirths. Predictive models for stillbirth were developed using multiple machine learning classifiers: regularised logistic regression, decision trees based on classification and regression trees, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a multilayer perceptron neural network. We applied 10-fold cross-validation using independent data not used to develop the models. Predictors included maternal socio-demographic characteristics, chronic medical conditions, obstetric complications and family history in both the current and previous pregnancy. In this cohort, 66% of stillbirths were observed for multiparous women. The best performing classifier (XGBoost) predicted 45% (95% CI: 43%, 46%) of stillbirths for all women and 45% (95% CI: 43%, 47%) of stillbirths after the inclusion of previous pregnancy history. Almost half of stillbirths could be potentially identified antenatally based on a combination of current pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, maternal characteristics, and medical history. Greatest sensitivity is achieved with addition of current pregnancy complications. Ensemble classifiers offered marginal improvement for prediction compared to logistic regression."
"The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial interplay between heredity and environment1,2. Here we report that deficiency in SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase that mediates the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, participates in the pathogenesis of IBD. We found that levels of SETDB1 are decreased in patients with IBD, and that mice with reduced SETDB1 in intestinal stem cells developed spontaneous terminal ileitis and colitis. SETDB1 safeguards genome stability3, and the loss of SETDB1 in intestinal stem cells released repression of endogenous retroviruses (retrovirus-like elements with long repeats that, in humans, comprise approximately 8% of the genome). Excessive viral mimicry generated by motivated endogenous retroviruses triggered Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-dependent necroptosis, which irreversibly disrupted homeostasis of the epithelial barrier and promoted bowel inflammation. Genome instability, reactive endogenous retroviruses, upregulation of ZBP1 and necroptosis were all seen in patients with IBD. Pharmaceutical inhibition of RIP3 showed a curative effect in SETDB1-deficient mice, which suggests that targeting necroptosis of intestinal stem cells may represent an approach for the treatment of severe IBD."
"The hypothesis linking hyperactivity with weight loss associated hypoleptinemia in anorexia nervosa gained momentum after a study showing that leptin suppressed semi-starvation induced hyperactivity in rats. Alternatively, ambient temperature is a key modulating factor of activity in semi-starved rats. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of leptin with increased ambient temperature in the prevention of hyperactivity in semi-starved rats. 74 Sprague-Dawley male rats were employed in two experiments with the difference residing in the length of baseline. After an extended (28 days), or shorter (14 days) baseline with free access to food and the running wheel, housed at 21 °C, animals were either ad-lib feed or food restricted (60% of food ingested during previous week) and infused with same amount of leptin at 21 °C, 25 °C, or vehicle at 21 °C, 25 °C and 32 °C for a week. Animals housed at 32 °C significantly reduced wheel running and weight loss during food restriction while animals given leptin did not yield no differences in activity or weight loss. Moreover, unlike animals housed at 32 °C, body temperature of leptin infused animals housed at 21 °C was significantly reduced during food restriction. Furthermore, leptin treated rats without a preceding stable pattern of activity displayed a severe dysregulation of circadian rhythm in activity and a collapse of body temperature. Housing temperature plays a more critical role than leptin in the regulation of semi-starvation induced hyperactivity in rats, which may be of relevance for the management of hyperactivity in anorexia nervosa."
"In a series of two studies, we report the development (this study) and evaluation (part II) of a novel ferric phytate compound designed as a condiment iron fortificant. Condiments are used as iron fortification vehicles to reduce the prevalence  of iron deficiency. The challenge for iron fortificants in e.g. a bouillon matrix is to avoid undesired sensory effects and to ensure a reasonable cost. We added phytic acid to chelate iron, and hydrolysed protein to counteract the inhibiting effect of phytic acid on iron bioaccessibility. We characterised four novel ferric phytate compounds, destabilised by hydrolysed plant protein or amino acids. Colour stability of fortified bouillons with ferric phytate compounds was superior to bouillons fortified with ferrous sulfate. The iron-phytate-hydrolysed corn protein compound (Fe-PA-HCP) resulted in highest cellular ferritin induction in Caco-2 cells, in both vegetable (36.1 ± 13.40 ng/mg protein) and chicken (73.9 ± 19.93 ng/mg protein) bouillon matrices as observed in the human Caco-2/HepG2 cell model. Iron uptake (as estimated by ferritin production) from the Fe-PA-HCP compound was about 55% (chicken bouillon) and 66% (vegetable bouillon) of the iron uptake from ferrous sulfate. Based on this study, the Fe-PA-HCP compound was chosen for further evaluation (part II)."
"BackgroundThe PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays critical roles in tumour immunology, and serves as an immune-based therapeutic target. Less is known regarding PD-L2, another ligand of PD-1, and its relation to clinical outcome in human cancers.MethodsWe used a database of 437 surgically and 100 endoscopically resected oesophageal cancers (squamous cell carcinoma, n = 483; adenocarcinoma, n = 36; others, n = 18) to evaluate PD-L2 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry.ResultsCompared with PD-L2-negative cases (n = 366, 83.8%), PD-L2-positive cases (n = 71, 16.2%) had worse overall survival (P = 0.011, log-rank test). There was not a significant correlation between PD-L2 and PD-L1 expression. Multiplex immunofluorescence revealed that there was variability in the expression pattern of PD-L2 and PD-L1. In early-stage tumours, PD-L2 expression was more frequently observed compared with PD-L1.ConclusionsPD-L2 as well as PD-L1 were associated with an unfavourable prognosis in oesophageal cancer, supporting the role of PD-L2 as a prognostic biomarker. Considering that PD-L2 and PD-L1 had different features in terms of expression timing and responses to chemotherapeutic drugs, evaluation of both PD-L2 and PD-L1 expression may be clinically important."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 demonstrate remarkable efficacy in treating B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BL-ALL), yet up to 39% of treated patients relapse with CD19(−) disease. We report that CD19(−) escape is associated with downregulation, but preservation, of targetable expression of CD20 and CD22. Accordingly, we reasoned that broadening the spectrum of CD19CAR T-cells to include both CD20 and CD22 would enable them to target CD19(−) escape BL-ALL while preserving their upfront efficacy. We created a CD19/20/22-targeting CAR T-cell by coexpressing individual CAR molecules on a single T-cell using one tricistronic transgene. CD19/20/22CAR T-cells killed CD19(−) blasts from patients who relapsed after CD19CAR T-cell therapy and CRISPR/Cas9 CD19 knockout primary BL-ALL both in vitro and in an animal model, while CD19CAR T-cells were ineffective. At the subcellular level, CD19/20/22CAR T-cells formed dense immune synapses with target cells that mediated effective cytolytic complex formation, were efficient serial killers in single-cell tracking studies, and were as efficacious as CD19CAR T-cells against primary CD19(+) disease. In conclusion, independent of CD19 expression, CD19/20/22CAR T-cells could be used as salvage or front-line CAR therapy for patients with recalcitrant disease."
"The prevalence of HIV in Guangxi was very high, and there were many children living with HIV (CLHIV) because of larger baseline of pregnant women infected by HIV. It is necessary for children to explore the status of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on different initial CD4 counts in children with HIV infected by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in Guangxi and to evaluate the progress towards the 90-90-90 targets proposed by UNAIDS/WHO. Based on a retrospective observational cohort of children with HIV infected from the Guangxi Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), the variables of all patients included viral loads, CD4 counts, laboratory results and WHO clinical staging of HIV/AIDS were collected. Several indicators were defined before analyzed: (1) diagnosis of MTCT: infants born to HIV-positive mothers who tested positive for HIV twice before 18 months; (2) ART initiation: the children who were enrolled in the treatment cohort and were still having HIV monitoring as of 6 months before date censored and (3) viral suppression: a recently viral load measurement that was less than 1000 copies per milliliter. The number of CLHIV in Guangxi was projected by using the estimates of the national HIV/AIDS prevalence from China CDC. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and the Holt Exponential Smoothing (ES) model were used to predict the number of CLHIV, the diagnosed CLHIV, the diagnosed CLHIV receiving ART and the number of them achieving viral suppression, in 2019 and 2021, respectively. In this 14-year HIV/AIDS treatment cohort, 807 children who were HIV infected by MTCT were enrolled. The ARIMA and Holt ES models showed that by the end of 2019, 82.71% of all CLHIV in Guangxi knew their HIV status, 84.50% of those diagnosed had initiated ART, and 85.68% of those on ART had durable viral suppression. By the end of 2021, 93.51% of all CLHIV in Guangxi will know their HIV status, 84.28% of those diagnosed will have initiated antiretroviral therapy, and 85.83% of those on ART will have durable viral suppression. Therefore, in 2021, Guangxi fails to achieve the WHO/UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for CLHIV, and there is still a wide time interval between the first HIV-positive diagnosis and ART initiation. National free antiretroviral treatment program (NFATP) requires strong enforcement to reduce the prevalence of later chronic diseases and complications."
"Pure laparoscopic donor right hepatectomy (PLDRH) is not a standard procedure for living donor liver transplantation but is safe and reproducible in the hands of experienced surgeons. However, the perioperative outcomes of PLDRH have not been fully evaluated yet. We used propensity score matching to compare the perioperative complications and postoperative short-term outcomes of donors undergoing PLDRH and open donor right hepatectomy (ODRH). A total of 325 consecutive donors who underwent elective, adult-to-adult right hepatectomy were initially screened. After propensity score matching, all patients were divided into two groups: PLDRH (n = 123) and ODRH (n = 123) groups. Perioperative complications and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. Postoperative pulmonary complications were significantly more common in the ODRH than in the PLDRH group (54.5 vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001). The biliary complications (leak and stricture) were higher in PLDRH group than in the ODRH group (8% vs. 3%), but it failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.167). Overall, surgical complication rates were similar between the two groups (P = 0.730). The opioid requirement during the first 7 postoperative days was higher in the ODRH group (686 vs. 568 mg, P < 0.001). The hospital stay and time to the first meal were shorter in the PLDRH than in the ODRH group (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). PLDRH reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and afforded better short-term postoperative outcomes compared to ODRH. However, surgical complication rates were similar in both groups."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) after chemoprophylaxis in patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures, and to identify risk factors for VTEs in this subgroup of patients. To detect VTE, multi-detector computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. Of 363 patients assessed, the incidence of symptomatic VTE was 12.4% (45 patients), and the incidence of symptomatic PE was 5.2% (19 patients). For the risk-factor analysis, a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.037), and a history of external fixator application (p = 0.007) were associated with increased VTE risk. Among patients who had VTE, male sex (p = 0.017), and above-the-knee fractures (p = 0.035) were associated with increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk. In conclusions, the incidence of VTE in post-traumatic patients is not low after chemoprophylaxis. Risk factors for VTE and PE are different among patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures."
"Checkpoint blockade therapies have improved cancer treatment, but such immunotherapy regimens fail in a large subset of patients. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (DC1s) control the response to checkpoint blockade in preclinical models and are associated with better overall survival in patients with cancer, reflecting the specialized ability of these cells to prime the responses of CD8+ T cells1,2,3. Paradoxically, however, DC1s can be found in tumours that resist checkpoint blockade, suggesting that the functions of these cells may be altered in some lesions. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing in human and mouse non-small-cell lung cancers, we identify a cluster of dendritic cells (DCs) that we name ‘mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules’ (mregDCs), owing to their coexpression of immunoregulatory genes (Cd274, Pdcd1lg2 and Cd200) and maturation genes (Cd40, Ccr7 and Il12b). We find that the mregDC program is expressed by canonical DC1s and DC2s upon uptake of tumour antigens. We further find that upregulation of the programmed death ligand 1 protein—a key checkpoint molecule—in mregDCs is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, while upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12 depends strictly on interferon-γ and is controlled negatively by IL-4 signalling. Blocking IL-4 enhances IL-12 production by tumour-antigen-bearing mregDC1s, expands the pool of tumour-infiltrating effector T cells and reduces tumour burden. We have therefore uncovered a regulatory module associated with tumour-antigen uptake that reduces DC1 functionality in human and mouse cancers."
"Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of fatty acid oxidation, but the role of ACADL in tumor biology remains largely unknown. Here, we found that ACADL was frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its low expression was significantly correlated with poor clinical prognosis of HCC patients. Restoring the expression of ACADL in HCC cells resulted cell cycle arrest and growth suppression through suppressing Hippo/YAP signaling evidenced by decreased YAP nuclear accumulation and downstream target genes expression. Reactivation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 diminished the inhibitory effect of ACADL on HCC growth. More importantly, the nuclear accumulation of YAP was negatively correlated with ACADL expression levels in HCC specimens, and YAP inhibitor verteporfin effectively suppressed growth of HCC organoids with low ACADL expression. Together, our findings highlight a novel function of ACADL in regulating HCC growth and targeting ACADL/Yap may be a potential strategy for HCC precise treatment."
"Today, we face difficulty in generating new hypotheses and understanding oral lichen planus due to the large amount of biomedical information available. In this research, we have used an integrated bioinformatics approach assimilating information from data mining, gene ontologies, protein–protein interaction and network analysis to predict candidate genes related to oral lichen planus. A detailed pathway analysis led us to propose two promising therapeutic targets: the stromal cell derived factor 1 (CXCL12) and the C-X-C type 4 chemokine receptor (CXCR4). We further validated our predictions and found that CXCR4 was upregulated in all oral lichen planus tissue samples. Our bioinformatics data cumulatively support the pathological role of chemokines and chemokine receptors in oral lichen planus. From a clinical perspective, we suggest a drug (plerixafor) and two therapeutic targets for future research."
"Liver metastasis, characterized by the spread of tumors to the liver from other areas, represents a deadly disease with poor prognosis. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic strategies and/or agents to combat liver metastasis primarily due to the insufficient understanding of liver metastasis. To develop a promising strategy for targeting liver metastasis, understanding of a cell origin responsible for liver metastasis and how this cell can be pharmacologically eliminated are therefore crucial. Using diverse tumor models including p53−/− genetic mouse model and syngeneic tumor models, we identified primordial germ cell (PGC)-like tumor cells, which are enriched in earliest liver micro-metastasis (up to 99%), as a cell origin of liver metastasis. PGC-like tumor cells formed earliest micro-metastasis in liver and gradually differentiated into non-PGC-like tumor cells to constitute late macro-metastasis in the course of tumor metastasis. The liver metastasis-initiating cells (PGC-like tumor cells) display cell renewal and differentiation capabilities, resemble primordial germ cells (PGCs) in morphology and PGC marker gene expression, and express higher level of the genes linked to metastasis and immune escape compared with non-PGC-like tumor cells. Of note, Stellarhigh PGC-like tumor cells, but not Stellarlow non-PGC-like cells, sorted from primary tumors of p53−/− mice readily form liver metastasis. Depletion of PGC-like tumor cells through genetic depletion of any of key germ cell genes impairs liver metastasis, while increased PGC-like tumor cells by SMAD2 knockout is correlated with markedly enhanced liver metastasis. Finally, we present the proof of principle evidence that pharmacologically targeting BMP pathways serves as a promising strategy to eliminate PGC-like tumor cells leading to abrogating liver metastasis. Collectively, our study identifies PGC-like tumor cells as a cell origin of liver metastasis, whose depletion by genetically targeting core PGC developmental genes or pharmacologically inhibiting BMP pathways serves a promising strategy for targeting liver metastasis."
"DNA Melting Analysis (DMA) with a TaqMan probe covering the mutation “hot spot” is a simple, sensitive, and “closed tube” method of mutation detection. However, DMA requires asymmetric PCR to produce single-stranded amplicons capable of interacting with TaqMan probes. This makes quantitative analysis impossible owing to low amplification efficiency. Moreover, bi-strand mutation detection necessitates two independent PCRs. The SLAM-MS (Stem-Loop AMplicon Mutation Scanning) assay, in which symmetric PCR is performed using primers with 5'-universal primer sequence (UPS), has been developed to detect KRAS mutations. Some of the resulting amplicons, sense and antisense, adopt single-stranded stem-loop conformation and become unable to renature, but able to hybridize with TaqMan probes. Hybrids of stem-loops and complementary TaqMan probes are suitable for melting analysis and simultaneous bi-strand mutation scanning. In addition, the areas under the melting peaks are determined by the PeakFit software, a non-linear iterative curve fitting program, to evaluate the wild-type/mutant allele ratio. Thus, the SLAM-MS assay permits quantification of both the number of copies of the target sequence and the percentage of mutant alleles. For mutant enrichment, the SLAM-MS assay uses TaqMan probes as PCR blocking agents allowing an ~10 times higher mutation detection sensitivity than High Resolution Melting (HRM) assay."
"Glycans within human lungs are recognized by many pathogens such as influenza A virus (IAV), yet little is known about their structures. Here we present the first analysis of the N- and O- and glycosphingolipid-glycans from total human lungs, along with histological analyses of IAV binding. The N-glycome of human lung contains extremely large complex-type N-glycans with linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PL) [-3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-]n extensions, which are predominantly terminated in α2,3-linked sialic acid. By contrast, smaller N-glycans lack PL and are enriched in α2,6-linked sialic acids. In addition, we observed large glycosphingolipid (GSL)-glycans, which also consists of linear PL, terminating in mainly α2,3-linked sialic acid. Histological staining revealed that IAV binds to sialylated and non-sialylated glycans and binding is not concordant with respect to binding by sialic acid-specific lectins. These results extend our understanding of the types of glycans that may serve as binding sites for human lung pathogens."
"China has made great efforts in air pollution control since 2013. However, there is a lack of evaluation of environmental, health and economic co-benefits associated with the national and local air pollution control measures at a city level. We analyzed local air pollution control policies and implementation in Jinan, one of the most heavily air-polluted cities in China between 2013 and 2017. We assessed the changes in exhaust emissions, air quality, mortality and morbidity of associated specific-diseases, and related economic benefits. We also projected the future scenarios of PM2.5 concentration dropped to 15 μg/m3. There were significant decreases in exhaust emissions of SO2 and NOx in Jinan during the study period. Annual reductions in ambient air pollution were 72.6% for SO2, 43.1% for PM2.5, and 34.2% for PM10. A total of 2,317 (95%CI: 1,533–2,842) premature deaths and 15,822 (95%CI: 8,734–23,990) related morbidity cases had been avoided in 2017, leading to a total of US$ 317.7 million (95%CI: 227.5–458.1) in economic benefits. Decreasing PM2.5 concentrations to 15 μg/m3 would result in reductions of 70% in total PM2.5-related non-accidental mortality and 95% in total PM2.5-related morbidity, which translates into US$ 1,289.5 million (95%CI: 825.8–1,673.6) in economic benefits. The national and local air pollution control measures have brought significant environmental, health and economic benefits to a previously heavy polluted Chinese city."
"Little is known regarding the impact of immigrant acculturation on the gut microbiome. We characterized differences in the gut microbiome between racially/ethnically diverse US immigrant and US-born groups, and determined the impact of dietary acculturation on the microbiome. Stool samples were collected from 863 US residents, including US-born (315 White, 93 Black, 40 Hispanic) and foreign-born (105 Hispanic, 264 Korean) groups. We determined dietary acculturation from dissimilarities based on food frequency questionnaires, and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiome. Gut microbiome composition differed across study groups, with the largest difference between foreign-born Koreans and US-born Whites, and significant differences also observed between foreign-born and US-born Hispanics. Differences in sub-operational taxonomic unit (s-OTU) abundance between foreign-born and US-born groups tended to be distinct from differences between US-born groups. Bacteroides plebeius, a seaweed-degrading bacterium, was strongly enriched in foreign-born Koreans, while Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were strongly enriched in foreign-born Koreans and Hispanics, compared with US-born Whites. Dietary acculturation in foreign-born participants was associated with specific s-OTUs, resembling abundance in US-born Whites; e.g., a Bacteroides plebeius s-OTU was depleted in highly diet-acculturated Koreans. In summary, we observed that US nativity is a determinant of the gut microbiome in a US resident population. Dietary acculturation may result in loss of native species in immigrants, though further research is necessary to explore whether acculturation-related microbiome alterations have consequences for immigrant health."
"Social media is now being used to model mental well-being, and for understanding health outcomes. Computer scientists are now using quantitative techniques to predict the presence of specific mental disorders and symptomatology, such as depression, suicidality, and anxiety. This research promises great benefits to monitoring efforts, diagnostics, and intervention design for these mental health statuses. Yet, there is no standardized process for evaluating the validity of this research and the methods adopted in the design of these studies. We conduct a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art in predicting mental health status using social media data, focusing on characteristics of the study design, methods, and research design. We find 75 studies in this area published between 2013 and 2018. Our results outline the methods of data annotation for mental health status, data collection and quality management, pre-processing and feature selection, and model selection and verification. Despite growing interest in this field, we identify concerning trends around construct validity, and a lack of reflection in the methods used to operationalize and identify mental health status. We provide some recommendations to address these challenges, including a list of proposed reporting standards for publications and collaboration opportunities in this interdisciplinary space."
"In patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), the effects of baseline characteristics, virological profiles, and therapeutic outcome to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PR) therapy on autoimmune diseases are unknown. Taiwanese Chronic Hepatitis C Cohort is a nationwide hepatitis C virus registry cohort comprising 23 hospitals of Taiwan. A total of 12,770 CHC patients receiving PR therapy for at least 4 weeks between January 2003 and December 2015 were enrolled and their data were linked to the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for studying the development of 10 autoimmune diseases. The mean follow-up duration was 5.3 ± 2.9 years with a total of 67,930 person-years, and the annual incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was 0.03%. Other autoimmune diseases were not assessable due to few events. Body mass index ≥24 kg/m2 was an independent predictor of the low incidence of SLE or RA (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.93, p = 0.034). A sustained virological response (SVR) to PR therapy was not associated with the low incidence of SLE or RA in any subgroup analysis. CHC patients achieving SVR to PR therapy did not exhibit an impact on the incidence of SLE or RA compared with non-SVR patients."
"Deep-seated epileptic focus estimation using magnetoencephalography is challenging because of its low signal-to-noise ratio and the ambiguity of current sources estimated by interictal epileptiform discharge (IED). We developed a distributed source (DS) analysis method using a volume head model as the source space of the forward model and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography combined with statistical methods (permutation tests between IEDs and baselines and false discovery rate between voxels to reduce variation). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combined DS (cDS) analysis in surgical cases. In total, 19 surgical cases with adult and pediatric focal epilepsy were evaluated. Both cDS and equivalent current dipole (ECD) analyses were performed in all cases. The concordance rates of the two methods with surgically identified epileptic foci were calculated and compared with surgical outcomes. Concordance rates from the cDS analysis were significantly higher than those from the ECD analysis (68.4% vs. 26.3%), especially in cases with deep-seated lesions, such as in the interhemispheric, fronto-temporal base, and mesial temporal structures (81.8% vs. 9.1%). Furthermore, the concordance rate correlated well with surgical outcomes. In conclusion, cDS analysis has better diagnostic performance in focal epilepsy, especially with deep-seated epileptic focus, and potentially leads to good surgical outcomes."
"Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) represents a reliable tool for retinal layer volume and thickness measurement. The aim of this study was to evaluate retinal changes indicating neurodegenerative processes in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to healthy controls. This was a cross-sectional, single-center study comprising 32 ESRD patients and 38 controls. Sectoral retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and retinal layer volumes were obtained by SD-OCT. Age- and gender-adjusted retinal layer volumes such as total retinal volume (p = 0.037), ganglion cell layer volume (GCL, p = 0.003), ganglion cell layer – inner plexiform layer volume (GCL-IPL, p = 0.005) and inner retinal layer volume (IRL, p = 0.042) of the right eye were lower in ESRD patients. Inner plexiform layer volume of both eyes (IPL, right eye: p = 0.017; left eye: 0.044) was reduced, as was RNFL thickness in the temporal superior sector (right eye: p = 0.016). A subgroup analysis excluding patients with diabetes revealed that GCL (p = 0.014) and GCL-IPL volume of the right eye (p = 0.024) and temporal superior sector of the RNFL scan (p = 0.021) in ESRD patients were still significantly thinner. We observed a decrease in several retinal layer volumes and temporal RNFL thickness indicative of retinal neurodegenerative processes in patients with ESRD."
"BackgroundCarbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-induced enzyme regulating tumour pH and facilitating cell migration/invasion. It is primarily expressed as a transmembrane cell-surface protein, but its ectodomain can be shed by ADAM17 to extracellular space. This study aims to elucidate the impact of CA IX shedding on cancer cells.MethodsWe generated a non-shed CA IX mutant by deletion of amino acids 393–402 from the stalk region and studied its phenotypic effects compared to full-length, shedding-competent CA IX using a range of assays based on immunodetection, confocal microscopy, in vitro real-time cell monitoring and in vivo tumour cell inoculation using xenografted NMRI and C57BL/6J female mice.ResultsWe demonstrated that the impairment of shedding does not alter the ability of CA IX to bind ADAM17, internalise, form oligomers and regulate pH, but induces cancer-promoting changes in extracellular proteome. Moreover, it affects intrinsic properties of cells expressing the non-shed variant, in terms of their increased ability to migrate, generate primary tumours and form metastatic lesions in lungs.ConclusionsOur results show that the ectodomain shedding controls pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic roles of the cell-associated CA IX and suggest that this phenomenon should be considered when developing CA IX-targeted therapeutic strategies."
"Epidemiologic and histopathologic findings and the laying hen model support the long-standing incessant ovulation hypothesis and cortical inclusion cyst involvement in sporadic ovarian cancer development. MicroRNA-200 (miR-200) family is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. Herewith, we show that ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells with ectopic miR-200 expression formed stabilized cysts in three-dimensional (3D) organotypic culture with E-cadherin fragment expression and steroid hormone pathway activation, whereas ovarian cancer 3D cultures with miR-200 knockdown showed elevated TGF-β expression, mitotic spindle disorientation, increased lumenization, disruption of ROCK-mediated myosin II phosphorylation, and SRC signaling, which led to histotype-dependent loss of collective movement in tumor spread. Gene expression profiling revealed that epithelial–mesenchymal transition and hypoxia were the top enriched gene sets regulated by miR-200 in both OSE and ovarian cancer cells. The molecular changes uncovered by the in vitro studies were verified in both human and laying hen ovarian cysts and tumor specimens. As miR-200 is also essential for ovulation, our results of estrogen pathway activation in miR-200-expressing OSE cells add another intriguing link between incessant ovulation and ovarian carcinogenesis."
"HIF-1α, an essential transcription factor under hypoxic condition, is indispensable for chondrocytes during skeletal development but its expression and roles in articular chondrocytes are yet to be revealed. We examined HIF-1α protein expression and the hypoxic condition during mouse osteoarthritis (OA) development using state of the art hypoxic probes and found that its expression decreased as OA progressed, coinciding with the change in hypoxic conditions in articular cartilage. Gain- and loss-of-function of HIF-1α in cell culture experiments showed that HIF-1α suppressed catabolic genes such as Mmp13 and Hif2a. We confirmed these anticatabolic effects by measuring glycosaminoglycan release from wild type and conditional knock-out mice femoral heads cultured ex vivo. We went on to surgically induce OA in mice with chondrocyte-specific deletion of Hif1a and found that the development of OA was exacerbated. Increased expression of catabolic factors and activation of NF-κB signalling was clearly evident in the knock-out mice. By microarray analysis, C1qtnf3 was identified as a downstream molecule of HIF-1α, and experiments showed it exerted anti-catabolic effects through suppression of NF-κB. We conclude that HIF-1α has an anti-catabolic function in the maintenance of articular cartilage through suppression of NF-κB signalling."
"Steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) studies routinely employ simultaneous presentation of two temporally modulated stimuli, with SSVEP amplitude modulations serving to index top-down cognitive processes. However, the nature of SSVEP amplitude modulations as a function of competing temporal frequency (TF) has not been systematically studied, especially in relation to the normalization framework which has been extensively used to explain visual responses to multiple stimuli. We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) as well as EEG from two awake macaque monkeys while they passively fixated plaid stimuli with components counterphasing at different TFs. We observed asymmetric SSVEP response suppression by competing TFs (greater suppression for lower TFs), which further depended on the relative orientations of plaid components. A tuned normalization model, adapted to SSVEP responses, provided a good account of the suppression. Our results provide new insights into processing of temporally modulated visual stimuli."
"The characteristic desmoplastic stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a key contributor to its lethality. This stromal microenvironment is populated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that interact with cancer cells to drive progression and chemo-resistance. Research has focused on CAFs in the primary tumour but not in metastases, calling into question the role of analogous metastasis-associated fibroblasts (MAFs). We infer a role of MAFs in murine hepatic metastases following untargeted treatment with the anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in vivo. Treated metastases were smaller and had fewer stromal cells, but were able to maintain angiogenesis and metastasis formation in the liver. Furthermore, sunitinib was ineffective at reducing MAFs alongside other stromal cells. We speculate that cancer cells interact with MAFs to maintain angiogenesis and tumour progression. Thus, we tested interactions between metastatic pancreatic cancer cells and fibroblasts using in vitro co-culture systems. Co-cultures enhanced fibroblast proliferation and induced angiogenesis. We identify carcinoma-educated fibroblasts as the source of angiogenesis via secretions of CXCL8 (aka IL-8) and CCL2 (aka MCP-1). Overall, we demonstrate that metastasis-associated fibroblasts have potential as a therapeutic target and highlight the CXCL8 and CCL2 axes for further investigation."
"Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease associated with cerebellar degeneration and motor deficits. However, many patients also exhibit neuropsychiatric impairments such as depression and apathy; nevertheless, the existence of a causal link between the psychiatric symptoms and SCA1 neuropathology remains controversial. This study aimed to explore behavioral deficits in a knock-in mouse SCA1 (SCA1154Q/2Q) model and to identify the underlying neuropathology. We found that the SCA1 mice exhibit previously undescribed behavioral impairments such as increased anxiety- and depressive-like behavior and reduced prepulse inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Surprisingly, non-motor deficits characterize the early SCA1 stage in mice better than does ataxia. Moreover, the SCA1 mice exhibit significant hippocampal atrophy with decreased plasticity-related markers and markedly impaired neurogenesis. Interestingly, the hippocampal atrophy commences earlier than the cerebellar degeneration and directly reflects the individual severity of some of the behavioral deficits. Finally, mitochondrial respirometry suggests profound mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum of the young SCA1 mice. These findings imply the essential role of hippocampal impairments, associated with profound mitochondrial dysfunction, in SCA1 behavioral deficits. Moreover, they underline the view of SCA1 as a complex neurodegenerative disease and suggest new avenues in the search for novel SCA1 therapies."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Though recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk variants for MDD, how these variants confer MDD risk remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterize the regulatory mechanism of MDD risk variants using a functional genomics approach. By integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (from human brain tissues or neuronal cells) and position weight matrix (PWM) data, we identified 34 MDD risk SNPs that disrupt the binding of 15 transcription factors (TFs). We verified the regulatory effect of the TF binding–disrupting SNPs with reporter gene assays, allelic-specific expression analysis, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identified the target genes that might be regulated by these regulatory risk SNPs. Finally, we found that NEGR1 (regulated by the TF binding–disrupting MDD risk SNP rs3101339) was dysregulated in the brains of MDD cases compared with controls, implying that rs3101339 may confer MDD risk by affecting NEGR1 expression. Our findings reveal how genetic variants contribute to MDD risk by affecting TF binding and gene regulation. More importantly, our study identifies the potential MDD causal variants and their target genes, thus providing pivotal candidates for future mechanistic study and drug development."
"Ischemic stroke is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can stimulate endogenous protection mechanisms by inducing ischemic tolerance to reduce subsequent damage caused by severe or fatal ischemia to non-ischemic organs. This study was designed to assess the therapeutic properties of RIPC in ischemic stroke and to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Neurobehavioral function was evaluated with the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test and gait analysis. PET/CT was used to detect the ischemic volume and level of glucose metabolism. The protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase-IV (COX-IV) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) were tested by Western blotting. TUNEL and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze apoptosis and to observe the nuclear translocation and colocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) in apoptotic cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to detect mitochondrial-derived vesicle (MDV) production and to assess mitochondrial ultrastructure. The experimental results showed that RIPC exerted significant neuroprotective effects, as indicated by improvements in neurological dysfunction, reductions in ischemic volume, increases in glucose metabolism, inhibition of apoptosis, decreased nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG from mitochondria and improved MDV formation. In conclusion, RIPC alleviates ischemia/reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke by inhibiting apoptosis via the endogenous mitochondrial pathway."
"Body fatness increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Insulin resistance and altered adipokines are potential mechanisms, but previous biomarker studies have been inconsistent. Intertumoral heterogeneity might provide an explanation. We investigated insulin, C-peptide, adiponectin, and leptin in relation to CRC molecular subtypes using a nested case-control design (1010 cases, 1010 matched controls, median 12.3 years from baseline to CRC diagnosis) from the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. Repeated samples were available from 518 participants. Risks of CRC and subtypes, defined by tumor BRAF and KRAS mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI) status, were estimated using conditional logistic regression and linear mixed models. Higher C-peptide and lower adiponectin were associated with increased CRC risk (odds ratios per standard deviation increase (95% CI): 1.11 (1.01, 1.23) and 0.91 (0.83, 1.00), respectively), though weakened when adjusted for body mass index. Insulin and leptin were not associated with CRC risk. Within-individual time trajectories were similar in cases and controls, and no subtype-specific relationships were identified (all Pheterogeneity > 0.1). Adiponectin was weakly inversely associated with the risk of KRAS-mutated (P = 0.08) but not BRAF-mutated or KRAS/BRAF-wildtype CRC, consistent with the one previous study. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the complex role of body size in CRC."
"The etiology and pathogenesis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) are unknown, and autoimmunity is one of many proposed underlying mechanisms. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) associations are hallmarks of autoimmune disease, and have not been thoroughly investigated in a large ME/CFS patient cohort. We performed high resolution HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1 genotyping by next generation sequencing in 426 adult, Norwegian ME/CFS patients, diagnosed according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria. HLA associations were assessed by comparing to 4511 healthy and ethnically matched controls. Clinical information was collected through questionnaires completed by patients or relatives. We discovered two independent HLA associations, tagged by the alleles HLA-C*07:04 (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.4–3.1]) and HLA-DQB1*03:03 (OR 1.5 [95% CI 1.1–2.0]). These alleles were carried by 7.7% and 12.7% of ME/CFS patients, respectively. The proportion of individuals carrying one or both of these alleles was 19.2% in the patient group and 12.2% in the control group (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.3–2.2], pnc = 0.00003). ME/CFS is a complex disease, potentially with a substantial heterogeneity. We report novel HLA associations pointing toward the involvement of the immune system in ME/CFS pathogenesis."
"Patients with acquired adult-onset strabismus mainly present with binocular diplopia. Although cranial nerve palsies are reportedly the most common cause of binocular diplopia in adults, thyroid disease can also cause diplopia. In patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, upper lid retraction and proptosis are the most common initial findings, but diplopia could be the first manifestation. So far, there has been little information on the diagnostic value of thyroid autoantibodies in patients with strabismus. Therefore, we examined adults with acquired binocular diplopia from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated the presence of thyroid autoantibodies and the relationship between thyroid autoantibody status and clinical characteristics in adults with acquired binocular diplopia. Thyroid autoantibody tests were performed for all patients, unless other causes of diplopia were identified. Fifty one (39%) of 132 patients were positive for thyroid autoantibodies. In the thyroid autoantibody-positive (TAb+) group, microsomal autoantibodies, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating antibodies were observed in 30, 27, 12, and 7 patients, respectively. The vertical deviation and grade of duction limitation were greater in the TAb+ group. The presence of ocular torsion was 15.5% and 39.5% in the TAb− and TAb+ groups, respectively. Thyroid autoantibody evaluation may be helpful in adults with idiopathic acquired binocular diplopia."
"ObjectiveTo compare the length of stay (LOS) against the expected date of delivery (EDD) and to describe mortality and LOS outcomes by gestational age (GA) categories over the years.Study designHealthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids’ Inpatient database discharge records for years 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016 were analyzed. For premature infants after inclusion–exclusion, actual, and calculated LOS were compared. Mortality and LOS outcomes were analyzed by GA and years.ResultsThe majority (99%) of infants >28 weeks were discharged by EDD while, for neonate ≤28 weeks, about three-quarters (75%) of infants were discharged by calculated EDD. LOS is increasing while mortality is decreasing by GA categories in recent years.ConclusionsThis is the largest study of mortality and LOS in the United States. Our study provides evidence-based numbers comparing actual LOS against EDD, which can be used in perinatal settings to counsel parents."
"Direct evidence in humans for the impact of the microbiome on nutrient absorption is lacking. We conducted an extended inpatient study using two interventions that we hypothesized would alter the gut microbiome and nutrient absorption. In each, stool calorie loss, a direct proxy of nutrient absorption, was measured. The first phase was a randomized cross-over dietary intervention in which all participants underwent in random order 3 d of over- and underfeeding. The second was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacologic intervention using oral vancomycin or matching placebo (NCT02037295). Twenty-seven volunteers (17 men and 10 women, age 35.1 ± 7.3, BMI 32.3 ± 8.0), who were healthy other than having impaired glucose tolerance and obesity, were enrolled and 25 completed the entire trial. The primary endpoints were the effects of dietary and pharmacological intervention on stool calorie loss. We hypothesized that stool calories expressed as percentage of caloric intake would increase with underfeeding compared with overfeeding and increase during oral vancomycin treatment. Both primary endpoints were met. Greater stool calorie loss was observed during underfeeding relative to overfeeding and during vancomycin treatment compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints were to evaluate the changes in gut microbial community structure as evidenced by amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. We observed only a modest perturbation of gut microbial community structure with under- versus overfeeding but a more widespread change in community structure with reduced diversity with oral vancomycin. Increase in Akkermansia muciniphila was common to both interventions that resulted in greater stool calorie loss. These results indicate that nutrient absorption is sensitive to environmental perturbations and support the translational relevance of preclinical models demonstrating a possible causal role for the gut microbiome in dietary energy harvest."
"Short-term dietary restriction (DR) may prevent organ damage from ischemic or toxic insults in animals, but clear evidence in humans is missing. While especially intraarterial administration of contrast media represents a cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI), targeted preventive strategies are not available. This trial investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of pre-interventional DR for preventing AKI in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients were randomized to receive a formula diet containing 60% of daily energy requirement (DR group) or ad-libitum food during the 4-day-interval before PCI. Primary endpoint was change of serum creatinine 48 h after PCI (Δcreatinine). Further analyses included incidence of AKI and safety evaluation. Δcreatinine post PCI in the DR group vs. the control group did not show any difference (DR: 0.03(−0.15,0.14)mg/dL vs. control: 0.09(−0.03,0.22)mg/dL;p = 0.797). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant beneficial impact of DR in patients that received ≤100 ml of contrast agent (DR n = 26: Δcreatinine −0.03(−0.20,0.08)mg/dL vs. control n = 24: Δcreatinine 0.10(−0.08,0.24)mg/dL; p = 0.041) and in patients with ≤2 risk factors for AKI (DR: n = 27; Δcreatinine −0.01(−0.18,0.07)mg/dL vs. control n = 31: Δcreatinine 0.09(−0.03,0.16)mg/dl; p = 0.030). Although the primary endpoint was not met, the results of this trial suggest a beneficial impact of DR in low-to-moderate risk patients."
"Elevated levels of serum ferritin (SF) are observed in several types of cancer; however, little is known on the association between ferritin and glioma, the most frequent type of human primary brain tumour. Here we report that GBM patients show significantly increased pre-surgical SF levels (i.e. ferritinaemia) within the SF reference range and a marked ferritin immunoreactivity of resected tumour tissue. Our findings account for an indirect association between ferritin synthesis in glioma-tissue and altered SF levels, which limits the clinical value of SF as a tumour marker in glioma. Importantly, we show for the first time that GBM-derived glioma cells release ferritin in vitro, which exerts an apoptosis-stimulating activity. Albeit the pathophysiologic context of apoptosis induction by a tumour-derived ferritin remains to be defined, our findings account for a distinct growth-regulatory role of these ferritin species in tumour biology."
"Recent cancer studies have found that the netrin family of proteins plays vital roles in the development of some cancers. However, the functions of the many variants of these proteins in cancer remain incompletely understood. In this work, we used the most comprehensive database available, including more than 10000 samples across more than 30 tumor types, to analyze the six members of the netrin family. We performed comprehensive analysis of genetic change and expression of the netrin genes and analyzed epigenetic and pathway relationships, as well as the correlation of expression of these proteins with drug sensitivity. Although the mutation rate of the netrin family is low in pan-cancer, among the tumor patients with netrin mutations, the highest number are Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma patients, accounting for 13.6% of cases (54 of 397). Interestingly, the highest mutation rate of a netrin family member is 38% for NTNG1 (152 of 397). Netrin proteins may participate in the development of endocrine-related tumors and sex hormone-targeting organ tumors. Additionally, the participation of NTNG1 and NTNG2 in various cancers shows their potential for use as new tumor markers and therapeutic targets. This analysis provides a broad molecular perspective of this protein family and suggests some new directions for the treatment of cancer."
"Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-β signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients."
"Brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma (BM-LUAD) frequently cause patient mortality. To identify genomic alterations that promote brain metastases, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 73 BM-LUAD cases. Using case-control analyses, we discovered candidate drivers of brain metastasis by identifying genes with more frequent copy-number aberrations in BM-LUAD compared to 503 primary LUADs. We identified three regions with significantly higher amplification frequencies in BM-LUAD, including MYC (12 versus 6%), YAP1 (7 versus 0.8%) and MMP13 (10 versus 0.6%), and significantly more frequent deletions in CDKN2A/B (27 versus 13%). We confirmed that the amplification frequencies of MYC, YAP1 and MMP13 were elevated in an independent cohort of 105 patients with BM-LUAD. Functional assessment in patient-derived xenograft mouse models validated the notion that MYC, YAP1 or MMP13 overexpression increased the incidence of brain metastasis. These results demonstrate that somatic alterations contribute to brain metastases and that genomic sequencing of a sufficient number of metastatic tumors can reveal previously unknown metastatic drivers."
"Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), and more recently, cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT) provides insight into all phases of atrial function. The aim of our study was to compare all phases of RA strain using CMR-FT and STE and also assess the relationship between RA and LA strain. A total of 61 healthy volunteers with mean age of 45 ± 13 years had adequate tracking for analysis on CMR-FT and 2D-STE. Females had larger RA reservoir strain (39 ± 15% vs. 32 ± 13%, p = 0.046) and conduit strain (26 ± 12% vs. 20 ± 9%, p = 0.03) when compared to males, but was not the case with booster strain (14 ± 7% vs. 12 ± 6%, p = 0.45). In comparison with STE derived strain, the RA reservoir and conduit strain were not significantly different between CMR-FT and the three echocardiography gating methods (p > 0.05 for all). Noticeably, there were no significant differences in strain and strain rate between RA and LA function using CMR-FT (p > 0.05 for all). RA strain and strain rate using CMR-FT had fair and good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and had superior reproducibility compared to STE derived strain."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise in hematologic malignancies, but its application to solid tumors has been challenging1,2,3,4. Given the unique effector functions of macrophages and their capacity to penetrate tumors5, we genetically engineered human macrophages with CARs to direct their phagocytic activity against tumors. We found that a chimeric adenoviral vector overcame the inherent resistance of primary human macrophages to genetic manipulation and imparted a sustained pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype. CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms) demonstrated antigen-specific phagocytosis and tumor clearance in vitro. In two solid tumor xenograft mouse models, a single infusion of human CAR-Ms decreased tumor burden and prolonged overall survival. Characterization of CAR-M activity showed that CAR-Ms expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, converted bystander M2 macrophages to M1, upregulated antigen presentation machinery, recruited and presented antigen to T cells and resisted the effects of immunosuppressive cytokines. In humanized mouse models, CAR-Ms were further shown to induce a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment and boost anti-tumor T cell activity."
"Estrogens have been shown to regulate the immune system and modulate multiple autoimmune diseases. 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE), a synthetic analog of 17β-estradiol, is prescribed commonly and found in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies. Surprisingly, few studies have investigated the immunoregulatory effects of exposure to EE, especially in autoimmunity. In this study, we exposed autoimmune-prone female MRL/lpr mice to a human-relevant dose of EE through the oral route of exposure. Since lupus patients are prone to infections, groups of mice were injected with viral (Imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist) or bacterial (ODN 2395, a TLR9 agonist) surrogates. We then evaluated autoimmune disease parameters, kidney disease, and response to in vivo TLR7/9 pathogenic signals. EE-exposed mice had increased proteinuria as early as 7 weeks of age. Proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, and glomerular immune complex deposition were also exacerbated when compared to controls. Production of cytokines by splenic leukocytes were altered in EE-exposed mice. Our study shows that oral exposure to EE, even at a very low dose, can exacerbate azotemia, increase clinical markers of renal disease, enhance glomerular immune complex deposition, and modulate TLR7/9 cytokine production in female MRL/lpr mice. This study may have implications for EE-exposure risk for genetically lupus-prone individuals."
"While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are poised to be translated into clinical practice through prediction of inborn health risks1, a strategy to utilize genetics to prioritize modifiable risk factors driving heath outcome is warranted2. To this end, we investigated the association of the genetic susceptibility to complex traits with human lifespan in collaboration with three worldwide biobanks (ntotal = 675,898; BioBank Japan (n = 179,066), UK Biobank (n = 361,194) and FinnGen (n = 135,638)). In contrast to observational studies, in which discerning the cause-and-effect can be difficult, PRSs could help to identify the driver biomarkers affecting human lifespan. A high systolic blood pressure PRS was trans-ethnically associated with a shorter lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.03[1.02–1.04], Pmeta = 3.9 × 10−13) and parental lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.06[1.06–1.07], P = 2.0 × 10−86). The obesity PRS showed distinct effects on lifespan in Japanese and European individuals (Pheterogeneity = 9.5 × 10−8 for BMI). The causal effect of blood pressure and obesity on lifespan was further supported by Mendelian randomization studies. Beyond genotype–phenotype associations, our trans-biobank study offers a new value of PRSs in prioritization of risk factors that could be potential targets of medical treatment to improve population health."
"Despite proper sleep hygiene being critical to our health, guidelines for improving sleep habits often focus on only a single component, namely, sleep duration. Recent works, however, have brought to light the importance of another aspect of sleep: bedtime regularity, given its ties to cognitive and metabolic health outcomes. To further our understanding of this often-neglected component of sleep, the objective of this work was to investigate the association between bedtime regularity and resting heart rate (RHR): an important biomarker for cardiovascular health. Utilizing Fitbit Charge HRs to measure bedtimes, sleep and RHR, 255,736 nights of data were collected from a cohort of 557 college students. We observed that going to bed even 30 minutes later than one’s normal bedtime was associated with a significantly higher RHR throughout sleep (Coeff +0.18; 95% CI: +0.11, +0.26 bpm), persisting into the following day and converging with one’s normal RHR in the early evening. Bedtimes of at least 1 hour earlier were also associated with significantly higher RHRs throughout sleep; however, they converged with one’s normal rate by the end of the sleep session, not extending into the following day. These observations stress the importance of maintaining proper sleep habits, beyond sleep duration, as high variability in bedtimes may be detrimental to one’s cardiovascular health."
"We investigated the extent to which pre-pregnancy obesity mediates the association between maternal place of birth and severe pre-eclampsia in the PreCARE cohort of pregnant women in Paris (n = 9,579). Adjusted path analysis logistic regression models were used to assess the role of pre-pregnancy obesity as a mediator in the association between maternal place of birth and the development of severe pre-eclampsia. We calculated 1. adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the total exposure-outcome association and for the direct and indirect/obesity-mediated components 2. the indirect/obesity-mediated effect. Ninety-five (0.99%) women developed severe pre-eclampsia, 47.6% were non-European immigrants, 16.3% were born in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 12.6% were obese (BMI > = 30 kg/m2). Women experiencing severe pre-eclampsia were more likely to be from Sub-Saharan Africa (p = 0.023) and be obese (p = 0.048). Mothers from Sub-Saharan Africa had an increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia compared to European-born mothers (aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.39–4.58) and the obesity-mediated indirect effect was 18% of the total risk (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03–1.35). In conclusion, Sub-Saharan African immigrant women have a two-fold higher risk of developing severe pre-eclampsia as compared to European-born women, one-fifth of which is mediated by pre-pregnancy obesity. Our results quantify the potential benefit of decreasing obesity among at-risk women."
"Systemic inflammation (SI) is increasingly studied in several species because it may be central in many metabolic disturbances and be a risk factor for clinical disease. This proof-of-concept study evaluated the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam on markers of SI and energy metabolism, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) function, and endometritis in clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows. Cows received meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg of body weight; n = 20) once daily for 4 days (10–13 days postpartum) or were untreated (n = 22). Blood samples were collected −7, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 21, 28, and 35 days relative to calving to measure serum concentrations of metabolic and inflammatory markers. Function of peripheral blood PMN were evaluated at 5, 10, 14, and 21, and proportion of PMN in endometrial cytology were performed at 5, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days postpartum. Meloxicam decreased serum haptoglobin from the second until the last day of treatment, and improved indicators of energy metabolism (lesser β-hydroxybutyrate and greater insulin-like growth factor-1 during treatment, and greater glucose at the end of treatment than control cows). This improved PMN function at 14 days postpartum, but the endometrial inflammatory status was not affected."
"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical syndromes characterized by progressive executive, behavioural and language dysfunction. The various FTD spectrum disorders are associated with brain accumulation of different proteins: tau, the transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43), or fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein, Ewing sarcoma protein and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15) (collectively known as FET proteins). Approximately 60% of patients with FTD have autosomal dominant mutations in C9orf72, GRN or MAPT genes. Currently available treatments are symptomatic and provide limited benefit. However, the increased understanding of FTD pathogenesis is driving the development of potential disease-modifying therapies. Most of these drugs target pathological tau — this category includes tau phosphorylation inhibitors, tau aggregation inhibitors, active and passive anti-tau immunotherapies, and MAPT-targeted antisense oligonucleotides. Some of these therapeutic approaches are being tested in phase II clinical trials. Pharmacological approaches that target the effects of GRN and C9orf72 mutations are also in development. Key results of large clinical trials will be available in a few years. However, clinical trials in FTD pose several challenges, and the development of specific brain imaging and molecular biomarkers could facilitate the recruitment of clinically homogenous groups to improve the chances of positive clinical trial results."
"Predation often has consistent effects on prey behavior and morphology, but whether the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects show similarly consistent patterns across different populations remains an open question. In vertebrates, predation risk activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and there is growing evidence that activation of the maternal HPA axis can have intergenerational consequences via, for example, maternally-derived steroids in eggs. Here, we investigated how predation risk affects a suite of maternally-derived steroids in threespine stickleback eggs across nine Alaskan lakes that vary in whether predatory trout are absent, native, or have been stocked within the last 25 years. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), we detected 20 steroids within unfertilized eggs. Factor analysis suggests that steroids covary within and across steroid classes (i.e. glucocorticoids, progestogens, sex steroids), emphasizing the modularity and interconnectedness of the endocrine response. Surprisingly, egg steroid profiles were not significantly associated with predator regime, although they were more variable when predators were absent compared to when predators were present, with either native or stocked trout. Despite being the most abundant steroid, cortisol was not consistently associated with predation regime. Thus, while predators can affect steroids in adults, including mothers, the link between maternal stress and embryonic development is more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship between the population-level predation risk experienced by mothers and the steroids mothers transfer to their eggs."
"BackgroundDAXX is a transcription repressor that has been implicated in several types of cancers, but its role in the development of gastric cancer remains unknown.MethodsWe analysed the expression of DAXX in 83 pairs of gastric cancer samples, including neoplastic and adjacent tissues, and correlated the expression levels with clinical stages. We also investigated the molecular mechanisms by which DAXX downregulation promotes cancer growth using both in vitro and in vivo models.ResultsDAXX was downregulated in advanced gastric cancer samples. The expression of DAXX inversely correlates with that of cancer stem cell markers CD44 and Oct4 in gastric cancer lines. DAXX overexpression in gastric cancer cells inhibited migration, invasion and epithelial– mesenchymal transition (EMT). The inhibition of EMT was achieved through the repression of SNAI3, a key inducer of EMT, by recruiting HDAC-1 into the nucleus. Using a xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that the MKN45 cells formed smaller tumours when DAXX was overexpressed. Wild-type AGS cells were not able to form tumours in nude mice, but in contrast, formed visible tumours when DAXX was silenced in the cells.ConclusionWe for the first time demonstrated that DAXX functions as a tumour suppressor in gastric cancer by inhibiting stem cell growth and EMT."
"Extranodal nasal-type natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is an Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) associated lymphoma that progresses rapidly and relapses frequently. Advanced ENKTL is multidrug chemoresistant and has a poor prognosis. In this study, we aim to develop a novel hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1)-based antitumor target for ENKTL that is involved with the antimetabolic signaling pathway, EBV replication, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. We showed that HKDC1 is highly upregulated in ENKTL cells and HKDC1 knockdown significantly suppresses ENKTL tumor growth. In addition, HKDC1 is highly identical with four other hexokinase isoforms, with the only difference being in the last eight amino acids (aa) at the C-terminal. Further investigation showed that peptide delivery of the last eight aa of HKDC1 at the C-terminal (HKC8) with D-configuration using transferrin (Tf) receptor internalization sequence (Tf-D-HKC8) inhibits HKDC1 association with vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VDAC1), resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overgeneration and subsequently suppressing EBV replication and P-gp expression, making it very effective in killing EBV-positive ENKTL cells. Further in vivo experiments showed that local injection of Tf-D-HKC8 peptide significantly suppresses ENKTL tumor growth and EBV replication in ENKTL xenograft mouse models. We conclude that HKDC1 C-terminal-based peptides inhibit ENKTL by modulation of mitochondrial function and EBV suppression."
"Globally, the life expectancy for men is 5.1 years less than for women. This gender gap in mortality is intrinsically linked to a higher proportion of premature male mortality and is a significant economic, social and healthcare issue. We explore the main causes for premature male death and also discuss the need for a dedicated men’s health clinic, especially in the context of potential commercial exploitation."
"Multispecies biofilms, in which both fungus and bacteria species can be present, play a significant role in persistent infections, and new therapeutic options are needed against them. In this study, the activities of ceragenins and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (magainin, cecropin A, LL-37) were investigated against multispecies biofilms formed by Candida albicans and four clinically important Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our results show that CSA-13 and CSA-90 were the most effective agents against both mono and multispecies biofilms (P < 0.05). CSA-131 and CSA-192 showed the least antimicrobial activity against mono and fungal-bacterial multispecies biofilms. Inhibition of multispecies biofilms with CSA-13 and CSA-90 was also confirmed through fluorescence microscopy images. When AMPs evaluated alone, they proved ineffective against both C. albicans and Gram-negative bacteria at the concentrations tested. In these studies, ceragenins were much more effective than AMPs against multi or monospecies biofilms, especially those containing C. albicans."
"Inflammation, among environmental risk factors, is one of the most important contributors to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. In this way, studies revealed that the incidence of CRC in inflammatory bowel disease patients is up to 60% higher than the general population. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules, have attracted excessive attention due to their fundamental role in various aspects of cellular biology, such as inflammation by binding to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of pro and anti-inflammatory genes. Based on multiple previous studies, SNPs at 3′-UTR can affect miRNA recognition elements by changing the thermodynamic features and secondary structure. This effect can be categorized, based on the number of changes, into four groups, including break, decrease, create, and enhance. In this paper, we will focus on functional variants in miRNA binding sites in inflammatory genes, which can modulate the risk of CRC by both investigating previous studies, regarding miRSNPs in inflammatory genes associated with CRC and recruiting in silico prediction algorithms to report putative miRSNPs in 176 inflammatory genes. In our analysis, we achieved 110 miRSNPs in 3′-UTR of 67 genes that seem good targets for future researches."
"Organotypic cultures of tissue slices have been successfully established in lung, prostate, colon, gastric and breast cancer among other malignancies, but until now an ex vivo model based on tissue slices has not been established for uterine leiomyoma. In the present study, we describe a method for culturing tumour slides onto an alginate scaffold. Morphological integrity of tissue slices was maintained for up to 7 days of culture, with cells expressing desmin, estrogen and progesterone receptors. Driver mutations were present in the ex vivo slices at all-time points analyzed. Cultivated tumour slices responded to ovarian hormones stimulation upregulating the expression of genes involved in leiomyoma pathogenesis. This tissue model preserves extracellular matrix, cellular diversity and genetic background simulating more in-vivo-like situations. As a novelty, this platform allows encapsulation of microspheres containing drugs that can be tested on the ex vivo tumour slices. After optimizing drug release rates, microspheres would then be directly tested in animal models through local injection."
"Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a few advantages such as less postoperative pain and faster recovery compared with conventional hemorrhoidectomy. There are two major devices used for stapled hemorrhoidopexy, PPH stapler (Ethicon EndoSurgery) and DST stapler (Covidien). This study was conducted to investigate the postoperative outcomes among patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids who underwent hemorrhoidopexy with either of these two devices. A total of 242 consecutive patients underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy with either PPH stapler (110 patients) or DST stapler (132 patients) at a single center in 2017. We performed a retrospective case–control study to compare the short-term postoperative outcomes and the complications between these two groups. After matching the cases in terms of age, gender, and the grade of hemorrhoids, there were 100 patients in each group (PPH versus DST). There were no significant differences in the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score and analgesic usage. Among complications, the incidence of anorectal stricture was significantly higher in the DST group (p = 0.02). Evaluation of the mucosal specimen showed that the total surface area, the muscle/mucosa ratio and the surface area of the muscle were also significantly higher in the DST group (p = 0.03). Further analysis of the DST group demonstrated that patients with anorectal stricture after surgery are younger than patients without anorectal stricture, and higher muscle/mucosa ratio (p = 0.03) and a higher surface area of the muscle (p = 0.03) also measured in the surgical specimen. The two devices provide similar outcomes of postoperative recovery. Patients who underwent DST stapled hemorrhoidopexy had a higher incidence rate of stricture, larger area of muscle excision, and higher muscle/mucosa ratio in the surgical specimen. Further investigation is warranted for a better understanding of the correlation between muscle excision and anorectal stricture."
"Tumor microenvironment plays vital roles in shaping cancer diversity, and CD73 (ecto-5′-nucleotidase; NT5E) is an emerging immune checkpoint in modulating cancer progression via conversion of immunostimulatory ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine. However, how the CD73 is regulated and how it functions in the progression of cancer are largely unknown. Here, we showed that CD73 was overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer. CD73 links adenosinergic signaling in microenvironment switching to induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype in gastric cancer during metastasis. Further pathway and gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptome data revealed the modulation role of CD73 in RICS/RhoA signaling by its extracellular function in adenosinergic pathway, which subsequently inhibited phosphorylation of LIMK/cofilin and promoted β-catenin activation. Pharmacological inhibition of CD73 adenosinergic signaling was found to induce RICS dysfunction. Dissemination and hematogenous metastasis model showed that targeting CD73 in gastric cancer could suppress experimental metastasis. To conclude, it substantiates CD73 as a target for treatment of gastric cancer metastasis and verifies RICS as an intracellular functional molecule linking CD73/adenosinergic signaling switching to RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) innervation contributes to the progression of PCa. However, the precise impact of innervation on PCa cells is still poorly understood. By focusing on muscarinic receptors, which are activated by the nerve-derived neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we show that muscarinic receptors 1 and 3 (m1 and m3) are highly expressed in PCa clinical specimens compared with all other cancer types, and that amplification or gain of their corresponding encoding genes (CHRM1 and CHRM3, respectively) represent a worse prognostic factor for PCa progression free survival. Moreover, m1 and m3 gene gain or amplification is frequent in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) specimens. This was reflected in HSPC-derived cells, which show aberrantly high expression of m1 and m3 under androgen deprivation mimicking castration and androgen receptor inhibition. We also show that pharmacological activation of m1 and m3 signaling is sufficient to induce the castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we found that m1 and m3 stimulation induces YAP activation through FAK, whose encoding gene, PTK2 is frequently amplified in CRPC cases. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK and knockdown of YAP abolished m1 and m3-induced castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Our findings provide novel therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic-signal-driven CRPC progression by targeting the FAK–YAP signaling axis."
"ObjectiveWe aimed to evaluate whether electrophysiological auditory thresholds (EATs) before 3 month of age, as assessed by the auditory brainstem responses (ABR) test and the auditory steady state responses (ASSR) test, can predict hearing outcome at 3 years of age among children born with congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection.Study designAudiological assessment was performed before 3 months of age, and every 6 months thereafter until 3 years of age, in a population of 63 children (126 ears). EATs before 3 months of age and at 3 years of age were compared.ResultNo ear with an EAT of ≤30 dBHL (i.e. normal hearing) before 3 months of age showed worsening EATs at 3 years of age.ConclusionAn EAT of ≤30 dBHL obtained by ABR and ASSR tests before 3 months of age is predictive of a normal hearing at 3 years of age in children born with cCMV."
"For over three decades, a mainstay and goal of clinical oncology has been the development of therapies promoting the effective elimination of cancer cells by apoptosis. This programmed cell death process is mediated by several signalling pathways (referred to as intrinsic and extrinsic) triggered by multiple factors, including cellular stress, DNA damage and immune surveillance. The interaction of apoptosis pathways with other signalling mechanisms can also affect cell death. The clinical translation of effective pro-apoptotic agents involves drug discovery studies (addressing the bioavailability, stability, tumour penetration, toxicity profile in non-malignant tissues, drug interactions and off-target effects) as well as an understanding of tumour biology (including heterogeneity and evolution of resistant clones). While tumour cell death can result in response to therapy, the selection, growth and dissemination of resistant cells can ultimately be fatal. In this Review, we present the main apoptosis pathways and other signalling pathways that interact with them, and discuss actionable molecular targets, therapeutic agents in clinical translation and known mechanisms of resistance to these agents."
"The 8q24 genomic locus is tied to the origin of numerous cancers. We investigate its contribution to hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) in independent study populations of the Nashville Familial Prostate Cancer Study and International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (combined: 2,836 HPC cases, 2,206 controls of European ancestry). Here we report 433 variants concordantly associated with HPC in both study populations, accounting for 9% of heritability and modifying age of diagnosis as well as aggressiveness; 183 reach genome-wide significance. The variants comprehensively distinguish independent risk-altering haplotypes overlapping the 648 kb locus (three protective, and four risk (peak odds ratios: 1.5, 4, 5, and 22)). Sequence of the near-Mendelian haplotype reveals eleven causal mutation candidates. We introduce a linkage disequilibrium-based algorithm discerning eight independent sentinel variants, carrying considerable risk prediction ability (AUC = 0.625) for a single locus. These findings elucidate 8q24 locus structure and correlates for clinical prediction of prostate cancer risk."
"Deaths from ovarian cancer usually occur when patients succumb to overwhelmingly numerous and widespread micrometastasis. Whereas epithelial–mesenchymal transition is required for epithelial ovarian cancer cells to acquire metastatic potential, the cellular phenotype at secondary sites and the mechanisms required for the establishment of metastatic tumors are not fully determined. Using in vitro and in vivo models we show that secondary epithelial ovarian cancer cells (sEOC) do not fully reacquire the molecular signature of the primary epithelial ovarian cancer cells from which they are derived. Despite displaying an epithelial morphology, sEOC maintains a high expression of the mesenchymal effector, TWIST-1. TWIST-1 is however transcriptionally nonfunctional in these cells as it is precluded from binding its E-box by the PcG protein, CBX7. Deletion of CBX7 in sEOC was sufficient to reactivate TWIST-1-induced transcription, prompt mesenchymal transformation, and enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo. This regulation allows secondary tumors to achieve an epithelial morphology while conferring the advantage of prompt reversal to a mesenchymal phenotype upon perturbation of CBX7. We also describe a subclassification of ovarian tumors based on CBX7 and TWIST-1 expression, which predicts clinical outcomes and patient prognosis."
"Cortical lesions (CLs) have a low prevalence and are associated with physical disabilities in Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the contribution of CLs to cognitive impairment remains unclear in Asian MS. Sixty-one prospectively enrolled MS patients underwent three-dimensional double inversion recovery MR imaging, the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB-N), the Apathy Scale (AS), the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) within a 1-week period. The cognitive impairment index (CII) score was calculated to measure patients’ overall cognitive impairment. MS patients with CLs had poorer scores than those without CLs in most BRB-N tests, but scored comparably in the FQ, AS, and HADS. The number of CLs correlated negatively with all BRB-N test scores and positively with total CII scores. Leukocortical lesions were more extensively associated with cognitive dysfunction in various domains than intracortical lesions. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that potential confounding factors for the highest quartile of CII score were the number of CLs (odds ratio 2.38, p = 0.0070) and the Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (odds ratio 2.13, p = 0.0003). Our results demonstrate that the presence and number of CLs are robustly associated with cognitive dysfunction in Asian MS patients."
"BackgroundAnti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, nivolumab, has shown efficacy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). However, the specific immune cell subsets predominantly activated during the period of anti-PD-1 therapy for AGC have not been clarified.MethodsPeripheral blood of 30 AGC patients treated with nivolumab was prospectively obtained before the initial and second administrations and at the time of progressive disease (PD). The proportions of immune cell subsets and the serum concentrations of cytokines were systematically analysed by flow cytometry. Associations of subsets and serum cytokines with therapeutic effects were evaluated.ResultsAfter the initial administration, significant increases in activated central/effector memory, activated effector T cells, and activated T-helper 1 subsets were observed. At the time of PD, activated regulatory T cells, LAG3-positive CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and TIM3-positive CD4+/CD8+ T cells increased significantly. Significant positive correlations were shown between progression-free survival and proportions of LAG3-positive CD4+/CD8+ T cells and of OX40-positive CD4+/CD8+ T cells (log-rank p = 0.0008, 0.0003, 0.0035 and 0.0040).ConclusionsNivolumab therapy enhances activation of central/effector memory and effector subsets of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. The expression levels of LAG-3 and OX40 on T cells correlated with the efficacy of nivolumab therapy and could be reasonable biomarkers for anti-PD-1 therapy."
"Men’s Health is a urological subspecialty that is at the forefront of innovation, but little data exist evaluating the attitudes that andrologists have toward the current treatment modalities available for managing Men’s Health conditions. A survey of 37 questions asking what providers would choose as treatment for common conditions was distributed online via Survey Monkey to members of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America and European Society for Sexual Medicine. A total of 115 respondents completed the survey after an initial screening question. For erectile dysfunction (ED), 40%, 38%, and 33% of providers indicated that they would use tadalafil daily, tadalafil on demand, or sildenafil on demand, respectively, as first-line phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, a total of 74% would elect to undergo low-intensity shockwave therapy [67%], platelet rich plasma injections [15%], and stem cell injections [15%]. Sex/behavioral therapy was preferred for both premature (36%) and delayed (52%) ejaculation. Approximately 44% of respondents indicated that they would undergo Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum injections for Peyronie’s Disease in the acute phase. In the setting of hypogonadal symptoms with borderline low total testosterone levels (300–400 ng/dL), 69% of respondents would pursue testosterone therapy. The prostatic lift procedure was the preferred procedure for men seeking symptom resolution with preservation of ejaculatory function. Many Men’s Health specialists would pursue the least invasive options before considering procedural intervention for any given condition. Providers may shift their treatment preferences toward newer treatment modalities as longer term data become available."
"We studied neurodevelopmental outcomes and behaviours in healthy 2-year old children (N = 1306) from Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the UK participating in the INTERGROWTH-21st Project. There was a positive independent relationship of duration of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and age at weaning with gross motor development, vision and autonomic physical activities, most evident if children were exclusively breastfed for ≥7 months or weaned at ≥7 months. There was no association with cognition, language or behaviour. Children exclusively breastfed from birth to <5 months or weaned at >6 months had, in a dose-effect pattern, adjusting for confounding factors, higher scores for “emotional reactivity”. The positive effect of EBF and age at weaning on gross motor, running and climbing scores was strongest among children with the highest scores in maternal closeness proxy indicators. EBF, late weaning and maternal closeness, associated with advanced motor and vision maturation, independently influence autonomous behaviours in healthy children."
"ObjectiveAssess impact of parental involvement in care provision for term substance exposed newborns (SENs).Study designProspective observational cohort study included mothers with opioid use disorder and their SENs over 4 year study period. Maternal–Infant dyads enrolled in EMPOWER and rooming-in (RI) programs were included and received care 24/7 in a private room until newborn’s discharge. Outcomes were compared for dyads participating in EMPOWER/RI with historical controls.ResultsNinety of 156 historical SENs were RI eligible, while 49 of 108 SENs born during RI period had mothers enrolled in EMPOWER. EMPOWER/RI SENs had lower rates for and duration of pharmacotherapy, shorter neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and hospital lengths of stay. EMPOWER/RI increased initiation and continuation of breastfeeding at discharge.ConclusionsParental participation was associated with a decrease in initiation and duration of pharmacotherapy, NICU admission, length of stay and hospital charges while increasing breastfeeding initiation and continuation at discharge."
"It is challenge to pinpoint the functional variants among numerous genetic variants. Investigating the spatial dynamics of the human brain transcriptome for genes and exploring the expression quantitative trait loci data may provide the potential direction to identify the functional variants among autism spectrum disorders (ASD) patients. In order to explore the association of ITIH3 with ASD, the present study included three components: identifying the spatial-temporal expression of ITIH3 in the developing human brain using the expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science; examining the cis-acting regulatory effect of SNPs on the ITIH3 expression using UK Brain Expression Consortium database; validating the effect of identified SNPs using a case-control study with samples of 602 cases and 604 controls. The public expression data showed that ITIH3 may have a role in the development of human brain and suggested a cis-eQTL effect for rs2535629 and rs3617 on ITIH3 in the hippocampus. Genetic analysis of the above two SNPs suggested that the over-dominant model of rs2535629 was significantly associated with decreased risk of ASD. Convergent lines of evidence supported ITIH3 rs25352629 as a susceptibility variant for ASD."
"Earlier diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) requires better understanding of the mechanisms driving tumorigenesis. In this context, depletion of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is known to impair development of PDAC-initiating lesions called acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN). In contrast, the role of v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), the preferred dimerization partner of EGFR, remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model with inactivation of Erbb2 in pancreatic acinar cells, we found that Erbb2 is dispensable for inflammation- and KRasG12D-induced development of ADM and PanIN. A mathematical model of EGFR/ERBB2-KRAS signaling, which was calibrated on mouse and human data, supported the observed roles of EGFR and ERBB2. However, this model also predicted that overexpression of ERBB2 stimulates ERBB/KRAS signaling; this prediction was validated experimentally. We conclude that EGFR and ERBB2 differentially impact ERBB signaling during PDAC tumorigenesis, and that the oncogenic potential of ERBB2 is only manifested when it is overexpressed. Therefore, the level of ERBB2, not only its mere presence, needs to be considered when designing therapies targeting ERBB signaling."
"In recent years, there has been a significant expansion in the development and use of multi-modal sensors and technologies to monitor physical activity, sleep and circadian rhythms. These developments make accurate sleep monitoring at scale a possibility for the first time. Vast amounts of multi-sensor data are being generated with potential applications ranging from large-scale epidemiological research linking sleep patterns to disease, to wellness applications, including the sleep coaching of individuals with chronic conditions. However, in order to realise the full potential of these technologies for individuals, medicine and research, several significant challenges must be overcome. There are important outstanding questions regarding performance evaluation, as well as data storage, curation, processing, integration, modelling and interpretation. Here, we leverage expertise across neuroscience, clinical medicine, bioengineering, electrical engineering, epidemiology, computer science, mHealth and human–computer interaction to discuss the digitisation of sleep from a inter-disciplinary perspective. We introduce the state-of-the-art in sleep-monitoring technologies, and discuss the opportunities and challenges from data acquisition to the eventual application of insights in clinical and consumer settings. Further, we explore the strengths and limitations of current and emerging sensing methods with a particular focus on novel data-driven technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence."
"Cognitive aging creates major individual and societal burden, motivating search for treatment and preventive care strategies. Behavioural interventions can improve cognitive performance in older age, but effects are small. Basic research has implicated dopaminergic signalling in plasticity. We investigated whether supplementation with the dopamine-precursor L-dopa improves effects of cognitive training on performance. Sixty-three participants for this randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were recruited via newspaper advertisements. Inclusion criteria were: age of 65–75 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score >25, absence of serious medical conditions. Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to either receive 100/25 mg L-dopa/benserazide (n = 32) or placebo (n = 31) prior to each of twenty cognitive training sessions administered during a four-week period. Participants and staff were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcomes were latent variables of spatial and verbal fluid intelligence. Compared to the placebo group, subjects receiving L-dopa improved less in spatial intelligence (−0.267 SDs; 95%CI [−0.498, −0.036]; p = 0.024). Change in verbal intelligence did not significantly differ between the groups (−0.081 SDs, 95%CI [−0.242, 0.080]; p = 0.323). Subjects receiving L-dopa also progressed slower through the training and the groups displayed differential volumetric changes in the midbrain. No statistically significant differences were found for the secondary cognitive outcomes. Adverse events occurred for 10 (31%) and 7 (23%) participants in the active and control groups, correspondingly. The results speak against early pharmacological interventions in older healthy adults to improve broader cognitive functions by targeting the dopaminergic system and provide no support for learning-enhancing properties of L-dopa supplements in the healthy elderly. The findings warrant closer investigation about the cognitive effects of early dopamine-replacement therapy in neurological disorders. This trial was preregistered at the European Clinical Trial Registry, EudraCT#2016-000891-54 (2016-10-05)."
"Study designCross-sectional.ObjectivesTo investigate factors influencing depressed mood in individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) and caregivers’ perceived burden in a low-income country.SettingDhulikhel Hospital and Spinal Injury Rehabilitation Center, Nepal.MethodsWe recruited 95 couples (one person with spinal cord injury and one caregiver) aged 18–65 years. Participants with various levels and types of TSCI with post-injury duration of or providing care for ≥1 month were eligible for the study. The Nepali Beck Depression Inventory and the Zarit Burden Interview-12 were used to identify depressed mood of those with TSCI and caregivers burden, respectively. Linear regression analyses to explore associations was performed.ResultsMean ages of the individuals with TSCI and caregivers were 34.8 (11.0) and 33.6 (12.3) years, respectively. Most of the participants with TSCI were male (67.4%) and (73.7%) had paraplegia. The caregivers were predominantly female (61.1%). Depressed mood was seen in 68% of those with TSCI, and burden was reported by 91.6% of caregivers. Depressed mood was significantly associated with gender, education, lesion type, and duration since the injury. Caregiver burden was associated with occupation, education, level of injury, length of care, and depressed mood level in the person with TSCI. Economic burden was found to be the highest (71.5%) followed by responsibility (22.2%) and time-related (6.3%) burden.ConclusionsThe prevalence of depressed mood among individuals with TSCI and the burden of caregiving among caregivers was high. Depressed mood in those with TSCI was associated with caregiver burden. Country-specific contextual factors need to be considered in deriving rehabilitation protocols."
"E6 oncoprotein derived from high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) drives the development of cervical cancer through p53 degradation. Because cervical cancer therapies to inactivate HPV or E6 protein are not available, alternative strategies are required. Here, we show that HPV-mediated nuclear export of human heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ) reduces the stability of p53 through UBE2L3-mediated p53 polyubiquitination during cervical cancer progression. In general, HP1 plays a key role in heterochromatin formation and transcription in the nucleus. However, our immunostaining data showed that the majority of HP1γ is localized in the cytoplasm in HPV-mediated cervical cancer. We found that HPV E6 protein drives unusual nuclear export of HP1γ through the interaction between the NES sequence of HP1γ and exportin-1. The mutation of the NES sequence in HP1γ led to nuclear retention of HP1γ and reduced cervical cancer cell growth and tumor generation. We further discovered that HP1γ directly suppresses the expression of UBE2L3 which drives E6-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53 in cervical cancer. Downregulation of UBE2L3 by overexpression of HP1γ suppressed UBE2L3-dependent p53 degradation-promoting apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. Our findings propose a useful strategy to overcome p53 degradation in cervical cancer through the blockage of nuclear export of HP1γ."
"The objective of the present study was to examine the association between birth by Caesarean section (CS) and otitis media (OM) in childhood. We assembled a retrospective cohort of children born between 2003 and 2007 in Nova Scotia and followed them through to 2014. The cohort was derived through a linkage of the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database with provincial administrative health data. Cox proportional hazards, negative binomial regression and logistic regression were used to examine the association between CS and OM. Among the 36,318 children, 27% were born by CS, and 78% had at least one OM episode (median 2 episodes). Children born by CS were at a slightly higher risk of OM (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.09), had more OM episodes in the first 7 years of life (incidence rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.07), and were more likely to be above the 95th percentile for OM episodes than children born vaginally (odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 0.99, 1.23). Our study shows that birth by CS is weakly associated with OM in childhood, but the clinical and public health impact of these findings is small."
"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been widely used to improve the fat retention rate in autologous fat transplantation since it possesses a good angiogenesis capability in vivo. However, due to the short half-life of growth factors released from PRP and its uneven distribution in injected fat tissue, the strategy of PRP in fat transplantation needs further improvement. Since the capillaries started to grow into fat grafts in 1 week and vascular growth peaks in the second week after transplantation, we hypothesized that delayed two-steps PRP injection into the interior of grafts, accompanied with the extent of neovascularization might theoretically promote microvessel growth inside transplanted adipose tissue. 24 nude mice were divided into three groups: Blank group (0.35 mL fat mixed with 0.15 mL saline, N = 8), Single step group (0.35 mL fat mixed with 0.15 mLPRP, N = 8), and Two steps group (0.35 mL fat (day 0) + 0.075 mL PRP (day 7) + 0.075 mL PRP (day 14), N = 8). At 6 and 14 weeks post-transplantation, grafts were dissected, weighted, and assessed for histology, angiogenesis, fat regeneration and inflammation level. The weight and volume of the fat samples revealed no statistical difference among the three groups at 6 weeks after fat transplantation. The weight and volume of the Two steps group fat samples showed significantly higher compared to that in Blank and Single step groups at 14 weeks after fat transplantation (weight: 137.25 ± 5.60 mg versus 87.5 ± 3.90 mg,106.75 ± 2.94 mg, respectively; volume: 0.13 ± 0.01 mL versus 0.08 ± 0.01 mL, 0.09 ± 0.01 mL, respectively). Histological assessments indicated that delayed two-steps PRP injection strategy helps to improve adipose tissue content and reduce the composition of fibrous connective tissue at 14 weeks after fat transplantation. At 6 weeks and 14 weeks after transplantation, CD31 immunofluorescence indicated that delayed two-steps PRP injection strategy helps to improve angiogenesis and significantly higher compared to that in Blank and Single step groups (6 weeks: 28.75 ± 4.54 versus 10.50 ± 2.06, 21.75 ± 1.85; 14 weeks: 21.75 ± 2.86 versus 9.87 ± 2.08, 11.75 ± 1.47, respectively). Preadipocyte count indicated delayed two-steps PRP injection strategy might promote fat regeneration and significantly higher compared to that in Blank and Single step groups at 14 weeks (129.75 ± 6.57 versus 13.50 ± 3.50, 17.12 ± 6.23, respectively). In this study, we demonstrated that the novel delayed two-steps PRP injection strategy remarkably enhanced the long-term fat retention rate and improved the neovascularization extent in the interior of the fat graft.

"There is currently much debate regarding the best model for how heritability varies across the genome. The authors of GCTA recommend the GCTA-LDMS-I model, the authors of LD Score Regression recommend the Baseline LD model, and we have recommended the LDAK model. Here we provide a statistical framework for assessing heritability models using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Based on 31 studies of complex human traits (average sample size 136,000), we show that the Baseline LD model is more realistic than other existing heritability models, but that it can be improved by incorporating features from the LDAK model. Our framework also provides a method for estimating the selection-related parameter α from summary statistics. We find strong evidence (P < 1 × 10−6) of negative genome-wide selection for traits, including height, systolic blood pressure and college education, and that the impact of selection is stronger inside functional categories, such as coding SNPs and promoter regions."
"In the present work, a method based on solvent extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been validated for the determination of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetics. Various solvents including ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol, dichloromethane and acetone have been used for the extraction of 1,4-dioxane, among them the ethyl acetate was found to be the most efficient extracting solvent. This method has offered excellent quality parameters for instance linearity (R2 > 0.9991), limit of detection (LOD, 0.00065-0.00091 µg/mL), limit of quantification (LOQ, 0.00217–0.00304 µg/mL) and, precision intra-day (1.65–2.60%, n = 5) and inter-day (0.16–0.32%, n = 5) in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD%). A total of thirty-nine cosmetic samples of different brands and origin have been studied. Among them, the 1,4-dioxane was found in twenty-three samples (FB1-FB7, MC1-MC4, MC6-MC8, HS3, HS5, BL1-BL3, BL5 and PLD1-PLD3) at the levels between 0.15 µg/mL and 9.92 µg/mL, whereas in sixteen samples (MC5, HS1, HS2, SG1-SG5, BL4 and HP1- HP6) was found to be not detected. The recovery values were achieved between 93% and 99% in both low and high level of spiked samples. In comparison to the traditional analytical techniques, the proposed method was found to be very sensitive and cost-effective for the routine analysis of 1,4-dioxane at low concentration in cosmetics."
"Mounting evidence suggests that function and connectivity of the striatum is disrupted in schizophrenia1,2,3,4,5. We have developed a new hypothesis-driven neuroimaging biomarker for schizophrenia identification, prognosis and subtyping based on functional striatal abnormalities (FSA). FSA scores provide a personalized index of striatal dysfunction, ranging from normal to highly pathological. Using inter-site cross-validation on functional magnetic resonance images acquired from seven independent scanners (n = 1,100), FSA distinguished individuals with schizophrenia from healthy controls with an accuracy exceeding 80% (sensitivity, 79.3%; specificity, 81.5%). In two longitudinal cohorts, inter-individual variation in baseline FSA scores was significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment response. FSA revealed a spectrum of severity in striatal dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders, where dysfunction was most severe in schizophrenia, milder in bipolar disorder, and indistinguishable from healthy individuals in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Loci of striatal hyperactivity recapitulated the spatial distribution of dopaminergic function and the expression profiles of polygenic risk for schizophrenia. In conclusion, we have developed a new biomarker to index striatal dysfunction and established its utility in predicting antipsychotic treatment response, clinical stratification and elucidating striatal dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders."
"Cardiac catheter ablation has shown the effectiveness of treating the idiopathic premature ventricular complex and ventricular tachycardia. As the most important prerequisite for successful therapy, criteria based on analysis of 12-lead ECGs are employed to reliably speculate the locations of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia before a subsequent catheter ablation procedure. Among these possible locations, right ventricular outflow tract and left outflow tract are the major ones. We created a new 12-lead ECG database under the auspices of Chapman University and Ningbo First Hospital of Zhejiang University that aims to provide high quality data enabling detection of the distinctions between idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia from right ventricular outflow tract to left ventricular outflow tract. The dataset contains 334 subjects who successfully underwent a catheter ablation procedure that validated the accurate origins of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia."
"The genetic architecture of each individual comprises common and rare variants that, acting alone and in combination, confer risk of disease. The cell-type-specific and/or context-dependent functional consequences of the risk variants linked to brain disease must be resolved. Coupling human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based technology with CRISPR-based genome engineering facilitates precise isogenic comparisons of variants across genetic backgrounds. Although functional-validation studies are typically performed on one variant in isolation and in one cell type at a time, complex genetic diseases require multiplexed gene perturbations to interrogate combinations of genes and resolve physiologically relevant disease biology. Our aim is to discuss advances at the intersection of genomics, hiPSCs and CRISPR. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease risk will improve genetic diagnosis, drive phenotypic drug discovery and pave the way toward precision medicine."
"Deep learning (DL) has been shown to be effective in developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) algorithms, possibly tackling financial and manpower challenges hindering implementation of DR screening. However, our systematic review of the literature reveals few studies studied the impact of different factors on these DL algorithms, that are important for clinical deployment in real-world settings. Using 455,491 retinal images, we evaluated two technical and three image-related factors in detection of referable DR. For technical factors, the performances of four DL models (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, Ensemble) and two computational frameworks (Caffe, TensorFlow) were evaluated while for image-related factors, we evaluated image compression levels (reducing image size, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150 KB), number of fields (7-field, 2-field, 1-field) and media clarity (pseudophakic vs phakic). In detection of referable DR, four DL models showed comparable diagnostic performance (AUC 0.936-0.944). To develop the VGGNet model, two computational frameworks had similar AUC (0.936). The DL performance dropped when image size decreased below 250 KB (AUC 0.936, 0.900, p < 0.001). The DL performance performed better when there were increased number of fields (dataset 1: 2-field vs 1-field—AUC 0.936 vs 0.908, p < 0.001; dataset 2: 7-field vs 2-field vs 1-field, AUC 0.949 vs 0.911 vs 0.895). DL performed better in the pseudophakic than phakic eyes (AUC 0.918 vs 0.833, p < 0.001). Various image-related factors play more significant roles than technical factors in determining the diagnostic performance, suggesting the importance of having robust training and testing datasets for DL training and deployment in the real-world settings."
"BackgroundModel animals are valuable resources for dissecting basic aspects of the regulation of obesity and metabolism. The translatability of results relies on understanding comparative aspects of molecular pathophysiology. Several studies have shown that despite the presence of overt obesity and dyslipidemia in the pig key human pathological hepatic findings such as hepatocellular ballooning and abundant steatosis are lacking in the model.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to elucidate why these histopathological characteristics did not occur in a high fat, fructose and cholesterol (FFC) diet-induced obese Göttingen Minipig model.MethodsHigh-throughput expression profiling of more than 90 metabolically relevant genes was performed in liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of male minipigs diet fed: standard chow (SD, n = 7); FFC diet (n = 14); FFC diet in streptozotocin-induced diabetic pigs (FFCDIA, n = 8). Moreover, histopathological assessment of SAT and VAT was performed.Results12, 4 and 1 genes were highly significantly differentially expressed in liver, SAT and VAT when comparing the FFC and SD groups whereas the corresponding numbers were 15, 2, and 1 when comparing the FFCDIA and SD groups. Although the minipigs in both FFC groups developed sever obesity and dyslipidemia, the insulin-signaling pathways were not affected. Notably, four genes involved in lipid acquisition and removal, were highly deregulated in the liver: PPARG, LPL, CD36 and FABP4. These genes have been reported to play a major role in promoting hepatic steatosis in rodents and humans. Since very little macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory response was detected in the adipose tissues the expansion appears to have no adverse impact on adipose tissue metabolism.ConclusionThe study shows that morbidly obese Göttingen Minipigs are protected against many of the metabolic and hepatic abnormalities associated with obesity due to a remarkable ability to expand the adipose compartments to accommodate excess calories."
"Blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) by therapeutic antibodies has shown to be a promising strategy in cancer therapy, yet clinical response in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer (PCa), is limited. Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack. This finding reports a new mechanism of how cancer cells regulate PD-L1 expression through epigenetic factors and provides a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment."
"Alpelisib is a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)α, shown to improve outcomes for PIK3CA-mutant, hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancers when combined with antiestrogen therapy. To uncover mechanisms of resistance, we conducted a detailed, longitudinal analysis of tumor and plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) among such patients from a phase I/II trial combining alpelisib with an aromatase inhibitor (NCT01870505). The trial’s primary objective was to establish safety with maculopapular rash emerging as the most common grade 3 adverse event (33%). Among 44 evaluable patients, the observed clinical benefit rate was 52%. Correlating genetic alterations with outcome, we identified loss-of-function PTEN mutations in 25% of patients with resistance. ESR1 activating mutations also expanded in number and allele fraction during treatment and were associated with resistance. These data indicate that genomic alterations that mediate resistance to alpelisib or antiestrogen may promote disease progression and highlight PTEN loss as a recurrent mechanism of resistance to PI3Kα inhibition."
"BackgroundWe tested the hypothesis that body mass index (BMI) aged 20 years modifies the association of adult weight gain and breast cancer risk.MethodsWe recruited women (aged 47–73 years) into the PROCAS (Predicting Risk Of Cancer At Screening; Manchester, UK: 2009–2013) Study. In 47,042 women, we determined BMI at baseline and (by recall) at age 20 years, and derived weight changes. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for new breast cancer using Cox models and explored relationships between BMI aged 20 years, subsequent weight changes and breast cancer risk.ResultsWith median follow-up of 5.6 years, 1142 breast cancers (post-menopausal at entry: 829) occurred. Among post-menopausal women at entry, BMI aged 20 years was inversely associated [HR per SD: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.95)], while absolute weight gain was associated with breast cancer [HR per SD:1.23 (95% CI: 1.14–1.32)]. For post-menopausal women who had a recall BMI aged 20 years <23.4 kg/m2 (75th percentile), absolute weight gain was associated with breast cancer [HR per SD: 1.31 (95% CIs: 1.21–1.42)], but there were no associations for women with a recall BMI aged 20 years of >23.4 kg/m2 (Pinteraction values <0.05).ConclusionsAdult weight gain increased post-menopausal breast cancer risk only among women who were <23.4 kg/m2 aged 20 years."
"Dry electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) recording combined with wireless data transmission offers an alternative tool to conventional wet electrode EEG systems. However, the question remains whether the signal quality of dry electrode recordings is comparable to wet electrode recordings in the clinical context. We recorded the resting state EEG (rsEEG), the visual evoked potentials (VEP) and the visual P300 (P3) from 16 healthy subjects (age range: 26–79 years) and 16 neurological patients who reported subjective memory impairment (age range: 50–83 years). Each subject took part in two recordings on different days, one with 19 dry electrodes and another with 19 wet electrodes. They reported their preferred EEG system. Comparisons of the rsEEG recordings were conducted qualitatively by independent visual evaluation by two neurologists blinded to the EEG system used and quantitatively by spectral analysis of the rsEEG. The P100 visual evoked potential (VEP) and P3 event-related potential (ERP) were compared in terms of latency, amplitude and pre-stimulus noise. The majority of subjects preferred the dry electrode headset. Both neurologists reported that all rsEEG traces were comparable between the wet and dry electrode headsets. Absolute Alpha and Beta power during rest did not statistically differ between the two EEG systems (p > 0.05 in all cases). However, Theta and Delta power was slightly higher with the dry electrodes (p = 0.0004 for Theta and p < 0.0001 for Delta). For ERPs, the mean latencies and amplitudes of the P100 VEP and P3 ERP showed comparable values (p > 0.10 in all cases) with a similar spatial distribution for both wet and dry electrode systems. These results suggest that the signal quality, ease of set-up and portability of the dry electrode EEG headset used in our study comply with the needs of clinical applications."
"Compared to liposomes, polymersomes of block copolymers (BCPs) possess enhanced stability, along with compromised bilayer permeability. Though polyion complex vesicles (PICsomes) from oppositely charged block polyelectrolytes possess semipermeable bilayers, they are unstable towards physiologically relevant ionic strength and temperature; moreover, permselectivity tuning of PICsomes has remained a challenge. Starting from a single component diblock or triblock precursor, we solve this dilemma by stimuli-triggered chemical reactions within pre-organized BCP vesicles, actuating in situ polymersome-to-PICsome transition and achieving molecular size-selective cargo release at tunable rates. UV light and reductive milieu were utilized to trigger carboxyl decaging and generate ion pairs within hydrophobic polymersome bilayers containing tertiary amines. Contrary to conventional PICsomes, in situ generated ones are highly stable towards extreme pH range (pH 2-12), ionic strength (~3 M NaCl), and elevated temperature (70 °C) due to multivalent ion-pair interactions at high local concentration and cooperative hydrogen bonding interactions of pre-organized carbamate linkages."
"Retinal implants are used to replace lost photoreceptors in blind patients suffering from retinopathies such as retinitis pigmentosa. Patients wearing implants regain some rudimentary visual function. However, it is severely limited compared to normal vision because non-physiological stimulation strategies fail to selectively activate different retinal pathways at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. The development of improved stimulation strategies is rendered difficult by the large space of potential stimuli. Here we systematically explore a subspace of potential stimuli by electrically stimulating healthy and blind mouse retina in epiretinal configuration using smooth Gaussian white noise delivered by a high-density CMOS-based microelectrode array. We identify linear filters of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by fitting a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model. Our stimulus evokes spatially and temporally confined spiking responses in RGC which are accurately predicted by the LNP model. Furthermore, we find diverse shapes of linear filters in the linear stage of the model, suggesting diverse preferred electrical stimuli of RGCs. The linear filter base identified by our approach could provide a starting point of a model-guided search for improved stimuli for retinal prosthetics."
"Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. While genetic factors may predispose for autoimmunity, additional environmental triggers, such as viral infections, are usually required to initiate the onset of disease. Here, we show that viral infection with LCMV results in type I IFN-dependent Treg cell loss that is rapidly compensated by the conversion and expansion of Vβ5+ conventional T cells into iTreg cells. Using Vβ5-deficient mice, we show that these Vβ5+ iTreg cells are dispensable for limiting anti-viral immunity. Rather, the delayed replenishment of Treg cells in Vβ5-deficient mice compromises suppression of microbiota-dependent activation of CD8+ T cells, resulting in colitis. Importantly, recovery from clinical symptoms in IBD patients is marked by expansion of the corresponding Vβ2+ Treg population in humans. Collectively, we provide a link between a viral trigger and an impaired Treg cell compartment resulting in the initiation of immune pathology."
"The TP53 genomic locus is a target of mutational events in at least half of cancers. Despite several decades of study, a full consensus on the relevance of the acquisition of p53 gain-of-function missense mutants has not been reached. Depending on cancer type, type of mutations and other unidentified factors, the relevance for tumour development and progression of the oncogenic signalling directed by p53 mutants might significantly vary, leading to inconsistent observations that have fuelled a long and fierce debate in the field. Here, we discuss how interaction with the microenvironment and stressors might dictate the gain-of-function effects exerted by individual mutants. We report evidence from the most recent literature in support of the context dependency of p53 mutant biology. This perspective article aims to raise a discussion in the field on the relevance that context might have on p53 gain-of-function mutants, assessing whether this should generally be considered a cell non-autonomous process."
"The liver is a unique organ that has a phenomenal capacity to regenerate after injury. Different surgical procedures, including partial hepatectomy (PH), intraoperative portal vein ligation (PVL), and associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) show clinically distinct recovery patterns and regeneration. The observable clinical differences likely mirror some underlying variations in the patterns of gene activation and regeneration pathways. In this study, we provided a comprehensive comparative transcriptomic analysis of gene regulation in regenerating rat livers temporally spaced at 24 h and 96 h after PH, PVL, and ALPPS. The time-dependent factors appear to be the most important determinant of post-injury alterations of gene expression in liver regeneration. Gene expression profile after ALPPS showed more similar expression pattern to the PH than the PVL at the early phase of the regeneration. Early transcriptomic changes and predicted upstream regulators that were found in all three procedures included cell cycle associated genes (E2F1, CCND1, FOXM1, TP53, and RB1), transcription factors (Myc, E2F1, TBX2, FOXM1), DNA replication regulators (CDKN1A, EZH2, RRM2), G1/S-transition regulators (CCNB1, CCND1, RABL6), cytokines and growth factors (CSF2, IL-6, TNF, HGF, VEGF, and EGF), ATM and p53 signaling pathways. The functional pathway, upstream, and network analyses revealed both unique and overlapping molecular mechanisms and pathways for each surgical procedure. Identification of molecular signatures and regenerative signaling pathways for each surgical procedure further our understanding of key regulators of liver regeneration as well as patient populations that are likely to benefit from each procedure."
"Leptin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), energy expenditure, and weight loss; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we uncover Sh2b1 in leptin receptor (LepR) neurons as a critical component of a SNS/brown adipose tissue (BAT)/thermogenesis axis. LepR neuron-specific deletion of Sh2b1 abrogates leptin-stimulated sympathetic nerve activation and impairs BAT thermogenic programs, leading to reduced core body temperature and cold intolerance. The adipose SNS degenerates progressively in mutant mice after 8 weeks of age. Adult-onset ablation of Sh2b1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus also impairs the SNS/BAT/thermogenesis axis; conversely, hypothalamic overexpression of human SH2B1 has the opposite effects. Mice with either LepR neuron-specific or adult-onset, hypothalamus-specific ablation of Sh2b1 develop obesity, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis. In contrast, hypothalamic overexpression of SH2B1 protects against high fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndromes. Our results unravel an unrecognized LepR neuron Sh2b1/SNS/BAT/thermogenesis axis that combats obesity and metabolic disease."
"Cryoablation has been used for the treatment of various sorts of solid visceral tumors, but few are reported on gastric tumor via endoscope, in terms of accurate control of ablation site, freezing depth and effective temperature. Thus, we developed a novel device, which could perform accurate cryoablation on the stomach via endoscope. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the device on porcine stomach. Results showed that the novel device could provide direct view of the operation space, allowing accurate and safe ablation of the stomach. Three minutes cryoablation caused a transmural, 1 cm radius gastric lesion. On serosal side, the temperature dropped to −64.2 °C, −34.1 °C, 26.1 °C at the center, 1 cm and 2 cm from center, respectively. Histopathology revealed acute ruptured cells with damaged glands in mucosa, partial disruption in muscularis propria and serosal slight exudation. Three months later, scar formed with complete recovery of gastric structure. No active bleeding or perforation of stomach, nor injury or adhesion of adjacent organs was observed. This endoscopic cryoablation device allowed safe, full-thickness cryoablation with effective temperature, which may provide an alternative treatment for gastric tumor."
"Hepatocytes undergo the metaplasia into ductal biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in response to chronic injury, and subsequently contribute to liver regeneration. The mechanism underlying hepatocyte-to-ductal metaplasia has not been explored until now. In mouse models of liver fibrosis, a florid BEC response was observed in fibrotic liver, and the depletion of myofibroblasts attenuated BEC expansion remarkably. Then, in hepatocyte fate-tracing mouse model, we demonstrated the conversion of mature hepatocytes into ductal BECs in fibrotic liver, and the depletion of myofibroblasts diminished the hepatocyte-to-ductal metaplasia. Finally, the mechanism underlying the metaplasia was investigated. Myofibroblasts secreted laminin-rich extracellular matrix, and then laminin induced hepatocyte-to-ductal metaplasia through ɑvβ6 integrin. Therefore, our results demonstrated myofibroblasts induce the conversion of mature hepatocytes into ductal BECs through laminin-ɑvβ6 integrin, which reveals that the strategy improve regeneration in fibrotic liver through the modification of specific microenvironment."
"Aberrant neuroendocrine signaling is frequent yet poorly understood feature of prostate cancers. Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) is responsible for the catalytic inactivation of neuropeptide substrates, and is downregulated in nearly 50% of prostate cancers. However its role in prostate carcinogenesis, including formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas, remains uncertain. Here we report that MME cooperates with PTEN in suppression of carcinogenesis by controlling activities of prostate stem/progenitor cells. Lack of MME and PTEN results in development of adenocarcinomas characterized by propensity for vascular invasion and formation of proliferative neuroendocrine clusters after castration. Effects of MME on prostate stem/progenitor cells depend on its catalytic activity and can be recapitulated by addition of the MME substrate, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Knockdown or inhibition of GRP receptor (GRPR) abrogate effects of MME deficiency and delay growth of human prostate cancer xenografts by reducing the number of cancer-propagating cells. In sum, our study provides a definitive proof of tumor-suppressive role of MME, links GRP/GRPR signaling to the control of prostate stem/progenitor cells, and shows how dysregulation of such signaling may promote formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas. It also identifies GRPR as a valuable target for therapies aimed at eradication of cancer-propagating cells in prostate cancers with MME downregulation."
"Cellular immunity is critical for controlling intracellular pathogens, but individual cellular dynamics and cell–cell cooperativity in evolving human immune responses remain poorly understood. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) represents a powerful tool for dissecting complex multicellular behaviors in health and disease1,2 and nominating testable therapeutic targets3. Its application to longitudinal samples could afford an opportunity to uncover cellular factors associated with the evolution of disease progression without potentially confounding inter-individual variability4. Here, we present an experimental and computational methodology that uses scRNA-seq to characterize dynamic cellular programs and their molecular drivers, and apply it to HIV infection. By performing scRNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four untreated individuals before and longitudinally during acute infection5, we were powered within each to discover gene response modules that vary by time and cell subset. Beyond previously unappreciated individual- and cell-type-specific interferon-stimulated gene upregulation, we describe temporally aligned gene expression responses obscured in bulk analyses, including those involved in proinflammatory T cell differentiation, prolonged monocyte major histocompatibility complex II upregulation and persistent natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic killing. We further identify response features arising in the first weeks of infection, for example proliferating natural killer cells, which potentially may associate with future viral control. Overall, our approach provides a unified framework for characterizing multiple dynamic cellular responses and their coordination."
"Abnormalities in actin cytoskeleton have been linked to Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), an inherited peripheral neuropathy characterised by an early loss of neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) among other clinical symptoms. Despite all efforts to date, we still do not fully understand the molecular events that contribute to the lack of sensory neurons in FRDA. We studied the adult neuronal growth cone (GC) at the cellular and molecular level to decipher the connection between frataxin and actin cytoskeleton in DRG neurons of the well-characterised YG8R Friedreich’s ataxia mouse model. Immunofluorescence studies in primary cultures of DRG from YG8R mice showed neurons with fewer and smaller GCs than controls, associated with an inhibition of neurite growth. In frataxin-deficient neurons, we also observed an increase in the filamentous (F)-actin/monomeric (G)-actin ratio (F/G-actin ratio) in axons and GCs linked to dysregulation of two crucial modulators of filamentous actin turnover, cofilin-1 and the actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3 complex. We show how the activation of cofilin is due to the increase in chronophin (CIN), a cofilin-activating phosphatase. Thus cofilin emerges, for the first time, as a link between frataxin deficiency and actin cytoskeleton alterations."
"An ability to characterize the cellular composition and spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiplexed IHC has been limited by the techniques available. Here we show the applicability of multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) for cell phenotype identification and analysis of spatial relationships across numerous tumor types. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from tumor biopsies were simultaneously stained with a panel of 15 antibodies, each labeled with a specific metal isotope. Multi-step processing produced images of the TME that were further segmented into single cells. Frequencies of different cell subsets and the distributions of nearest neighbor distances between them were calculated using this data. A total of 50 tumor specimens from 15 tumor types were characterized for their immune profile and spatial organization. Most samples showed infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and macrophages present amongst tumor cells. Spatial analysis of the TME in two ovarian serous carcinoma images highlighted differences in the degree of mixing between tumor and immune cells across samples. Identification of admixed PD-L1+ macrophages and PD-1+ T cells in an urothelial carcinoma sample allowed for the detailed observations of immune cell subset spatial arrangement. These results illustrate the high-parameter capability of MIBI at a sensitivity and resolution uniquely suited to understanding the complex tumor immune landscape including the spatial relationships of immune and tumor cells and expression of immunoregulatory proteins."
"Sustainability is now accounted for in certain food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). In 2017, the French FBDG were updated to incorporate environmental preservation. We conducted a multi-indicator evaluation of the 2001 and 2017 FBDG, based on data from 28,340 participants in the NutriNet-Santé cohort who completed an organic food frequency questionnaire. Indicators related to nutrition, environment (three indicators and the synthetic partial ReCiPe (pReCiPe) score) and economy were used, to distinguish organic and conventional farming systems. To estimate compliance with the 2001 and 2017 FBDG, we used two validated adherence scores (PNNS-GS1 and PNNS-GS2, respectively). We estimated numbers of averted deaths by adhering to the FBDG using a competing risk assessment model. Higher adherence to the 2017 guidelines was related to higher plant-based diet, cost and deaths averted and lower energy intake, synthetic environmental score and exposure to certain pesticides. Overall, larger differences between lowest and highest PNNS-GS2 were observed than between lowest and highest PNNS-GS1. Our results suggest that the 2017 guidelines are in line overall with the multiple dimensions of diet sustainability, including health, although at a slight cost increase. If adopted by a large part of the population, these dietary guidelines might contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases while reducing food-related environmental pressures."
"This prospective observational study, conducted at a community clinic in Japan during the influenza season, from December 2017 to April 2018 aimed to investigate the accuracy of factors used for influenza self-diagnosis. Data were collected from pre-examination checklists issued to patients with suspected influenza and electronic medical records. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using a rapid influenza diagnostic test as the reference standard, and 2 × 2 contingency tables were analysed at each cut-off point. We analysed data from 290 patients (72.8% males, median age: 38 years, interquartile range: 26–50 years). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for patients who were aware of other patients presumed to have influenza within close proximity was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66–0.82). The AUCs for patients with a history of influenza, unvaccinated status, cough, or nasal discharge were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60–0.75), 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59–0.73), 0.67 (95% CI: 0.59–0.75), and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62–0.78), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio at a 90% cut-off point was 19.5% (95% CI: 13.5–26.6%), 94.1% (95% CI: 88.7–97.4%) and 3.31 (95% CI: 1.57–6.98). The sensitivity, specificity and negative likelihood ratio at a 10% cut-off point was 95.5% (95% CI: 90.9–98.2%), 9.6% (95% CI: 5.2–15.8%) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.20–1.16). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the AUC increased significantly from 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70–0.83) to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76–0.86) when self-diagnosis-related information was added to basic clinical information. We identified factors that improve the accuracy and validity of influenza self-diagnosis. Appropriate self-diagnosis could contribute to the containment efforts during influenza epidemics and reduce its social and economic burden."
"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNAemia and CMV disease have been reported as more frequent in patients undergoing haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Haplo-HSCT) than in those receiving HLA-matched allografts. This could be due to impaired CMV-specific T-cell reconstitution. Here, we conducted a multicenter observational study to assess CMV pp65 and IE-1-specific T cells kinetics in patients undergoing unmanipulated Haplo-HSCT with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy-haplo) and compared it with patients allografted with HLA-matched donors. Plasma CMV DNA load was monitored by real-time PCR and enumeration of CMV-specific IFN-γ-producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was performed by flow cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining at days +30, +60, +90, and +180 after transplantation. CMV DNAemia developed in 62 patients, occurring with comparable frequency in PT/Cy-haplo and MRD/MUD recipients (P = 0.14). There were no significant differences across groups in the number of patients either displaying detectable CMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses or acquiring CMV-specific T-cell levels conferring protection against subsequent infection. CMV-specific T-cell counts were comparable between groups at most time points examined, irrespective of whether CMV DNAemia occurred or not prior to monitoring. Collectively the data suggest that PT/Cy-haplo recipients may reconstitute CMV-specific T-cell immunity to the same extent as patients undergoing HLA-matched allo-HSCT."
"ObjectiveNeonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up clinic provides continued surveillance and assessment of high-risk premature infants. We hypothesized that attrition is associated with race and social factors.Study designWe performed a retrospective cohort study of neonates born at 26–32 weeks gestation who were admitted to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and follow-up attendance were collected. Statistical analysis was performed with significance set at p value < 0.05.ResultsIn total, 237 neonates met study criteria. There was a 62% loss to follow-up over 2 years. Factors associated with loss to follow-up included older gestational age, African American race, and maternal cigarette smoking. Protective factors included older maternal age, a neonatal diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and longer hospital length of stay.ConclusionsSocial disparities negatively impact neonatal follow-up clinic attendance. Efforts to identify and target high-risk populations must be started during initial hospitalization before infants are lost to follow-up."
"Differences in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture can influence the integrity of topologically associating domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer–promoter interactions, impacting gene expression and leading to human disease. Here we investigate the 3D chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by using primary human leukemia specimens and examine the dynamic responses of this architecture to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP–seq datasets revealed widespread differences in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD ‘fusion’ event associated with absence of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data also demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation can alter specific 3D interactions found in leukemia. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia."
"Exercise induces different effects on antioxidant status depending on its intensity. The forced running wheel (FRW) model maintains a constant intensity and volume during exercise. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of FRW exercise at different running speeds on several serum biochemical parameters of liver and muscle functions and on oxidative stress biomarkers in skeletal muscle, liver and serum in the rat. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Five groups participated in constant power tests at intensities of 10, 13, 14.5, 16, and 17.5 m/min, and a non-exercise group was chosen as the control. Serum, muscle and liver tissues were collected after the tests and analyzed. At speeds >16 m/min, exercise on an FRW significantly increased several serum biochemical parameters, malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase activity in all tissues of exercise rats compared with control rats; FRW exercise also increased catalase activity in the liver and glutathione S-transferase activity in muscle, whereas it decreased glutathione level in all tissues and catalase activity in muscle and serum. These data suggest that FRW exercise in rats activates an adaptation of the antioxidant system response in skeletal muscle at speeds <16 m/min, whereas it induces oxidative stress at higher speeds in muscle, liver and serum. In addition, we observed a correlation between the systematic and local oxidative stress status in rats after exercise on FRW."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and practicality of 3D-printed model-guided endoscopic surgery for the treatment of basal ganglia hemorrhage. The authors retrospectively analyzed the data of all patients who underwent endoscopic evacuation of basal ganglia hemorrhage in the Department of Neurosurgery at Dalang Hospital and Shipai Hospital between December 2017 and February 2019. Twelve patients, in whom the 3D-printed model guidance was used for endoscopic evacuation, were included in this investigation. Using 3D reconstructed technology, we designed the appropriate surgical approach. Then, an individualized facial model with the guide orifice was printed by a 3D printer. Further, the 3D-printed model was employed to guide the insertion of the endoscope sheath. As a result, the average evacuation rate was 97.2% (range 90.1–100.0%). The GCS and mRS score were improved in each patient from admission to discharge examination. All patients had a good prognosis based on their functional independence measure (FIM) scores at the 6-month follow-up. The 3D-printed model-guided endoscopic evacuation was effective and safe for basal ganglia hemorrhage. This technique deserves further investigation to determine its role in intracerebral hemorrhage management."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and a major public health concern. CVD prediction is one of the most effective measures for CVD control. In this study, 29930 subjects with high-risk of CVD were selected from 101056 people in 2014, regular follow-up was conducted using electronic health record system. Logistic regression analysis showed that nearly 30 indicators were related to CVD, including male, old age, family income, smoking, drinking, obesity, excessive waist circumference, abnormal cholesterol, abnormal low-density lipoprotein, abnormal fasting blood glucose and else. Several methods were used to build prediction model including multivariate regression model, classification and regression tree (CART), Naïve Bayes, Bagged trees, Ada Boost and Random Forest. We used the multivariate regression model as a benchmark for performance evaluation (Area under the curve, AUC = 0.7143). The results showed that the Random Forest was superior to other methods with an AUC of 0.787 and achieved a significant improvement over the benchmark. We provided a CVD prediction model for 3-year risk assessment of CVD. It was based on a large population with high risk of CVD in eastern China using Random Forest algorithm, which would provide reference for the work of CVD prediction and treatment in China."
"The elimination of DNA polymerase eta (pol η) causes discontinuous DNA elongation and fork stalling in UV-irradiated cells. Such alterations in DNA replication are followed by S-phase arrest, DNA double-strand break (DSB) accumulation, and cell death. However, their molecular triggers and the relative timing of these events have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that DSBs accumulate relatively early after UV irradiation in pol η-depleted cells. Despite the availability of repair pathways, DSBs persist and chromosome instability (CIN) is not detectable. Later on cells with pan-nuclear γH2AX and massive exposure of template single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which indicate severe replication stress, accumulate and such events are followed by cell death. Reinforcing the causal link between the accumulation of pan-nuclear ssDNA/γH2AX signals and cell death, downregulation of RPA increased both replication stress and the cell death of pol η-deficient cells. Remarkably, DSBs, pan-nuclear ssDNA/γH2AX, S-phase arrest, and cell death are all attenuated by MRE11 nuclease knockdown. Such results suggest that unscheduled MRE11-dependent activities at replicating DNA selectively trigger cell death, but not CIN. Together these results show that pol η-depletion promotes a type of cell death that may be attractive as a therapeutic tool because of the lack of CIN."
"We administered Ad26, modified vaccinia Ankara vectors containing mosaic HIV-1 antigens or placebo in 26 individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy during acute human immunodeficiency virus infection as an exploratory study to determine the safety and duration of viremic control after treatment interruption. The vaccine was safe and generated robust immune responses, but delayed time to viral rebound compared to that in placebo recipients by only several days and did not lead to viremic control after treatment interruption (clinical trial NCT02919306)."
"Identification of the causes of poor oral vaccine immunogenicity in low-income countries might lead to more effective vaccines. We measured mucosal and systemic immune parameters at the time of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in 292 Indian infants aged 6–11 months, including plasma cytokines, leukocyte counts, fecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and peripheral blood T-cell phenotype, focused on gut-homing regulatory CD4+ populations. We did not find a distinct immune phenotype associated with OPV immunogenicity, although viral pathogens were more prevalent in stool at the time of immunization among infants who failed to seroconvert (63.9% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.002). Using a machine-learning approach, we could predict seroconversion a priori using immune parameters and infection status with a median 58% accuracy (cross-validation IQR: 50–69%) compared with 50% expected by chance. Better identification of immune predictors of OPV immunogenicity is likely to require sampling of mucosal tissue and improved oral poliovirus infection models."
"Most neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the intracellular or extracellular aggregation of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β and tau in Alzheimer disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson disease, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Accumulating evidence from both human studies and disease models indicates that intercellular transmission and the subsequent templated amplification of these misfolded proteins are involved in the onset and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases. The misfolded proteins that are transferred between cells are referred to as ‘pathological seeds’. Recent studies have made exciting progress in identifying the characteristics of different pathological seeds, particularly those isolated from diseased brains. Advances have also been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transmission process, and the influence of the host cell on the conformation and properties of pathological seeds. The aim of this Review is to summarize our current knowledge of the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological proteins and to identify key questions for future investigation."
"Glycodelin is a major glycoprotein expressed in reproductive tissues, like secretory and decidualized endometrium. It has several reproduction related functions that are dependent on specific glycosylation, but it has also been found to drive differentiation of endometrial carcinoma cells toward a less malignant phenotype. Here we aimed to elucidate whether the glycosylation and function of glycodelin is altered in endometrial carcinoma as compared with a normal endometrium. We carried out glycan structure analysis of glycodelin expressed in HEC-1B human endometrial carcinoma cells (HEC-1B Gd) by mass spectrometry glycomics strategies. Glycans of HEC-1B Gd were found to comprise a typical mixture of high-mannose, hybrid, and complex-type N-glycans, often containing undecorated LacNAc (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) antennae. However, several differences, as compared with previously reported glycan structures of normal human decidualized endometrium-derived glycodelin isoform, glycodelin-A (GdA), were also found. These included a lower level of sialylation and more abundant poly-LacNAc antennae, some of which are fucosylated. This allowed us to select lectins that showed different binding to these classes of glycodelin. Despite the differences in glycosylation between HEC-1B Gd and GdA, both showed similar inhibitory activity on trophoblast cell invasion and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation. For the detection of cancer associated glycodelin, we established a novel in situ proximity-ligation based histochemical staining method using a specific glycodelin antibody and UEAI lectin. We found that the UEAI reactive glycodelin was abundant in endometrial carcinoma, but virtually absent in normal endometrial tissue even when glycodelin was strongly expressed. In conclusion, we established a histochemical staining method for the detection of endometrial carcinoma-associated glycodelin and showed that this specific glycodelin is exclusively expressed in cancer, not in normal endometrium. Similar methods can be used for studies of other glycoproteins."
"BackgroundStromal–tumour interactions facilitate pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET pathway is upregulated in PC and mediates the interaction between cancer cells and stromal pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). This study assessed the effect of HGF/c-MET inhibition plus gemcitabine (G) on the progression of advanced PC.MethodsOrthotopic PC was produced by implantation of luciferase-tagged human cancer cells + human PSCs into mouse pancreas. Tumours were allowed to develop without treatment for 4 weeks. Mice were then treated for 6 weeks with one of the following: IgG, G, HGF inhibitor (Hi), c-MET inhibitor (Ci), Hi + Ci, Hi + G, Ci + G, or Hi + Ci + G.ResultsBioluminescence imaging showed similar tumour sizes in all mice at the initiation of treatments. Triple therapy (Hi + Ci + G): (1) completely eliminated metastasis; (2) significantly reduced tumour size as assessed by bioluminescence and at necropsy; (3) significantly reduced proliferating cancer cell density and stem cell marker DCLK1 expression in tumours. In vitro 3D culture studies supported our in vivo findings.ConclusionEven at an advanced disease stage, a two-pronged approach, targeting (a) HGF/c-MET with relevant inhibitors and (b) cancer cells with chemotherapy, completely eliminated metastasis and significantly decreased tumour growth, suggesting that this is a promising treatment approach for PC."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. However, no reliable biomarkers have been identified to represent the clinical status. This study aimed to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings are useful imaging biomarkers to indicate the clinical status of ALS patients. Ninety-six probable or definite ALS cases and 47 age- and sex-matched, normal controls were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected at the time of DTI. DTI data were acquired using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner and analysed by voxel-wise statistical analyses for fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and mode of anisotropy. Compared with the healthy control group, the ALS group had significant differences in DTI scalars in the diffuse tracts of the brain, which was predominant in the corticospinal tract at the brainstem and cerebellar peduncle area. Furthermore, the DTI values correlated with the ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) scores and the delta ALSFRS-R score representing the rate of disease progression. The subgroup analysis revealed a more severe and widespread brain degeneration was observed in rapidly progressive ALS. Therefore, our results suggest that DTI findings are useful as imaging biomarkers for evaluating the clinical severity and rate of disease progression in ALS."
"Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) frequently causes systemic inflammation. Recent studies have shown that cancer cells reshape the immune landscape by secreting cytokines or chemokines. This phenotype, called cancer-cell-intrinsic inflammation, triggers a metastatic cascade. Here, we identified the functional role and regulatory mechanism of inflammation driven by advanced ccRCC cells. The inflammatory nature of advanced ccRCC was recapitulated in a preclinical model of ccRCC. Amplification of cancer-cell-intrinsic inflammation during ccRCC progression triggered neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis. Massive expression of inflammation-related genes was transcriptionally activated by epigenetic remodelling through mechanisms such as DNA demethylation and super-enhancer formation. A bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor synchronously suppressed C-X-C-type chemokines in ccRCC cells and decreased neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis. Overall, our findings provide insight into the nature of inflammatory ccRCC, which triggers metastatic cascades, and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy."
"Most human cancers are aneuploid, due to a chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype. Despite being hallmarks of cancer, however, the roles of CIN and aneuploidy in tumor formation have not unequivocally emerged from animal studies and are thus still unclear. Using a conditional mouse model for diverse degrees of CIN, we find that a particular range is sufficient to drive very early onset spontaneous adenoma formation in the intestine. In mice predisposed to intestinal cancer (ApcMin/+), moderate CIN causes a remarkable increase in adenoma burden in the entire intestinal tract and especially in the distal colon, which resembles human disease. Strikingly, a higher level of CIN promotes adenoma formation in the distal colon even more than moderate CIN does, but has no effect in the small intestine. Our results thus show that CIN can be potently oncogenic, but that certain levels of CIN can have contrasting effects in distinct tissues."
"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy for women worldwide, while Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% in all patients. Compared with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, which could be effectively controlled via endocrine therapy, TNBC is more aggressive and worse in prognosis. It is therefore urgent and necessary to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment. Recent studies identified Hippo signaling is highly activated in TNBC, which could be a driving pathway for TNBC progression. In our study, we determine RNF187 as a negative regulator for Hippo signaling activation. RNF187 depletion significantly decreases cell migration and invasion capacity in TNBC. These effects could be rescued by further YAP depletion. Depletion of RNF187 increases the YAP protein level and Hippo signaling target genes, such as CTGF and CYR61 in TNBC. Immuno-precipitation assay shows that RNF187 associates with YAP, promoting its degradation possibly via inducing YAP K48-dependent poly-ubiquitination. Interestingly, Our clinical data reveals that RNF187 reversely correlates with YAP protein level and Hippo target genes. RNF187 tends to correlate with good prognosis in TNBC patients. Our study provides evidence to establish a proteolytic mechanism in regulation Hippo signaling activation in TNBC."
"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients have an extremely poor prognosis, partly due to their immunosuppressive state. The majority of ATLL patients have leukemic cells with phenotype similar to Tregs, prompting suggestions that ATLL cells themselves have immunosuppressive functions. In this study, we detected CD39 expression on ATLL cells, particularly frequent on aggressive subtypes. CD39 and CD73 convert extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine, a key player in Tregs’ immunosuppression. In vitro culture, both CD39+ ATLL cells and normal Tregs converted rapidly extracellular ATP to AMP, which was disturbed by CD39 inhibitors, and was negated in the CD39 knockout MJ cell line. The proliferation of cocultured CD4+/CD8+ normal T cells was suppressed by CD39+ MJ cells, but not by CD39 knockout MJ cells. Supplemented ATP was exhausted by an EG7-OVA T-cell line with stable CD39 induction, but not by mock. When these cell lines were subcutaneously transplanted into murine flanks, Poly(I:C) peritoneal administration reduced tumor size to 1/3 in mock-transplanted tumors, but not in CD39 induced tumors. Overall, we found that ATLL cells express CD39 at a high rate, and our results suggest that this helps ATLL cells escape antitumor immunity through the extracellular ATPDase-Adenosine cascade. These findings will guide future clinical strategies for ATLL treatment."
"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea–derived polyphenol, exhibits antitumor activities. An EGCG nanoemulsion (nano-EGCG) was prepared to improve the stability and reduce the side effects of EGCG for treatment of human lung cancer cells, and the antitumor effects were studied. The possible molecular mechanism underlying its antitumor effects on cultured human lung cancer cells was also elucidated. The antitumor effects of EGCG and nano-EGCG were determined using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, migration, and invasion assays. In addition, changes in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway were investigated using Western blot analyses. AMPK inhibitors were used to determine the roles of the AMPK signaling pathway involved in the molecular mechanism of the nano-EGCG. Our results showed that both EGCG and nano-EGCG inhibited the growth of H1299 lung cancer cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 36.03 and 4.71 μM, respectively. Additionally, nano-EGCG effectively suppressed lung cancer cell colony formation, migration, and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Nano-EGCG may inhibit lung cancer cell invasion through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2- and MMP-9-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, the expression of several key regulatory proteins in the AMPK signaling pathway was modulated by nano-EGCG. Nano-EGCG may inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion through the activation of AMPK signaling pathways. This novel mechanism of nano-EGCG suggests its application in lung cancer prevention and treatment. Our results provide an experimental foundation for further research on its potential activities and effects in vivo."
"The relationship between induced abortion(IA) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy(HDP) is inconclusive. Few studies have been conducted in China. In order to clarify the association between previous IA and risk of HDP, including gestational hypertension(GH) and pre-eclampsia(PE), we performed a community-based prospective cohort study enrolling 5191 eligible nulliparous women in selected 2 districts and 11 towns of Liuyang from 2013 to 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to examine whether IA was associated with HDP, GH and PE. Of the gravidea, 1378(26.5%) had a previous IA and 258(5.0%) diagnosed with HDP, including 141(2.7%) GH and 117(2.3%) PE. The difference in the incidence of GH and PE between gravidae having one versus those with two or more IAs was minimal. After adjustment for maternal age, body mass index at first antenatal visit, education, virus infection and history of medical disorders, previous IA was significantly associated with HDP (OR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.49 to 0.91) and PE (OR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.38 to 0.97), but not with GH (OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.49 to 1.10). Additional adjustment for occupation, living area, anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus, psychological stress, conception climate and infant sex, multivariable analysis provided similar results. In conclusion, previous IA was associated with a lower risk of PE among nulliparous women."
"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is suspected of being a risk factor for patients with cancer. This study aimed to assess the clinical consequences of CHIP in patients with lymphoma intended for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in a population-based setting. We identified 892 lymphoma patients who had undergone stem cell harvest at all transplant centers in Denmark. A total of 565 patients had an available harvest sample, which was analysed for CHIP by next-generation sequencing, and the median follow-up was 9.1 years. Of the patients who were intended for immediate ASCT, 25.5% (112/440) carried at least one CHIP mutation. In contrast to previous single-center studies CHIP was not associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in multivariate analyses. However, patients with mutations in genes of the DNA repair pathway (PPM1D, TP53, RAD21, BRCC3) had a significant inferior OS (HR after 1 year of follow-up 2.79, 95% confidence interval 1.71–4.56; p < 0.0001), which also was evident in multivariate analysis (p = 0.00067). These patients had also increased rates of therapy-related leukemia and admission to intensive care. Furthermore, in patients who did not undergo immediate ASCT, a significant inferior OS of individuals with DNA repair mutations was also identified (p = 0.003)."
"Cardiovascular risk factors are usually better tolerated, and can therefore be perceived as less harmful, at a young age. However, over time the effects of these adverse factors may persist or accumulate and lead to excess morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases later in life. Until now, reference values for the basic cardiovascular health characteristics of 4-to-6 year-old children are lacking. Within a follow-up study of the ENVIRONAGE (ENVIRonmental influence ON early AGE) birth cohort we assessed various cardiovascular measurements in 288 children aged 4–5 years. For the macrovasculature, we measured their blood pressure and examined the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery (CIMT), the arterial elasticity (including the pulse-wave velocity (PWV), carotid distensibility (DC) and compliance (CC) coefficients), the carotid β stiffness index (SIβ) and Young’s Elastic Modulus (YEM). Retinal microvascular traits included the Central Retinal Arteriolar Equivalent (CRAE) and Central Retinal Venular Equivalent (CRVE). Age of the study population averaged (±SD) 4.2 (±0.4 years. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 97.9 (±8.1) mmHg and 54.7(±7.6) mmHg, respectively. CIMT for the total population averaged 487.1 (±68.1) µm. The average stiffness values for DC, CC, SIβ, and PWV were 78.7 (±34.2) 10−³/kPa, 1.61 (±0.59) mm2/kPa and 4.4 (±2.4), and 3.7 m/s (±0.9) respectively. The mean determined for YEM was 163.2 kPa (±79.9). Concerning the microvasculature, the average CRAE was 180.9 (±14.2) µm and the corresponding value for CRVE was 251.0 (±19.7) µm. In contrast to the macrovasculature, a significant gender-related difference existed for the microvasculature: in boys, both the CRAE (178.8 µm vs 182.6 µm; p = 0.03) and CRVE (247.9 µm vs 254.0 µm; p = 0.01) were narrower than in girls. We have provided reference values for young children to understand changes in the early cardiovascular health trajectory. Establishing these reference values of cardiovascular phenotypes at this young age is necessary to develop targeted health promotion strategies as well as for better understanding of the life course changes of both small and large blood vessels."
"Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from impaired vision, a condition with multiple origins that often impinge upon the light sensing cells of the retina, the photoreceptors, affecting their integrity. The molecular components contributing to this integrity are however not yet fully understood. Here we have asked whether Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) may be one of such factors. SFRP1 has a context-dependent function as modulator of Wnt signalling or of the proteolytic activity of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases (ADAM) 10, a main regulator of neural cell-cell communication. We report that in Sfrp1−/− mice, the outer limiting membrane (OLM) is discontinuous and the photoreceptors disorganized and more prone to light-induced damage. Sfrp1 loss significantly enhances the effect of the Rpe65Leu450Leu genetic variant -present in the mouse genetic background- which confers sensitivity to light-induced stress. These alterations worsen with age, affect visual function and are associated to an increased proteolysis of Protocadherin 21 (PCDH21), localized at the photoreceptor outer segment, and N-cadherin, an OLM component. We thus propose that SFRP1 contributes to photoreceptor fitness with a mechanism that involves the maintenance of OLM integrity. These conclusions are discussed in view of the broader implication of SFRP1 in neurodegeneration and aging."
"Tooth formation can be affected by various factors, such as oral disease, drug administration, and systemic illness, as well as internal conditions including dentin formation. Dyslipidemia is an important lifestyle disease, though the relationship of aberrant lipid metabolism with tooth formation has not been clarified. This study was performed to examine the effects of dyslipidemia on tooth formation and tooth development. Dyslipidemia was induced in mice by giving a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Additionally, LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr−/−) strain mice were used to analyze the effects of dyslipidemia and lipid metabolism in greater detail. In the HFD-fed mice, incisor elongation was decreased and pulp was significantly narrowed, while histological findings revealed disappearance of predentin. In Ldlr−/− mice fed regular chow, incisor elongation showed a decreasing trend and pulp a narrowing trend, while predentin changes were unclear. Serum lipid levels were increased in the HFD-fed wild-type (WT) mice, while Ldlr−/− mice given the HFD showed the greatest increase. These results show important effects of lipid metabolism, especially via the LDL receptor, on tooth homeostasis maintenance. In addition, they suggest a different mechanism for WT and Ldlr−/− mice, though the LDL receptor pathway may not be the only factor involved."
"Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD) is a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease with a wide-range of presentations and treatment strategies, depending on the source of pulmonary circulation, anatomy of pulmonary arteries (PAs), and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). Data about the outcomes in developing countries is scarce. We therefore conducted a retrospective study to assess survival rates and mortality risks of 90 children with PA/VSD at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand during 2005–2016. Patients with single ventricle were excluded. Survival and mortality risks were analyzed at the end of 2018. The median age of diagnosis was 0.5 (0–13.8) years. The patients’ PAs were categorized into four groups: 1) PA/VSD with confluent PAs (n = 40), 2) PA/VSD with confluent PAs and MAPCAs (n = 21), 3) PA/VSD with non-confluent PAs and MAPCAs (n = 12), and 4) PA/VSD with small native PAs and MAPCAs (n = 17). Of the 88 patients who underwent operations, 32 patients had complete repair at 8.4 ± 4.6 years old. During the follow-up [median time of 5.7 years (7 days-13.6 years)], 17 patients (18.9%) died. The survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years of age were 95%, 83.7%, and 79.6%, respectively. Significant mortality risks were the presence of associated anomalies and non-confluent PAs."
"Techniques for analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect, characterize and monitor cancer have matured rapidly. An increasing body of clinical evidence is demonstrating the capabilities of this technology as a diagnostic test. The full potential of ctDNA liquid biopsy in the diagnosis, characterization and management of solid and hematological malignancies will be uncovered through interventional clinical trials evaluating clinical utility. In this Review, we discuss the current landscape of ctDNA liquid-biopsy applications across the cancer continuum and highlight opportunities for clinical investigation."
"The objective of the present manuscript was to evaluate the effects of 24-weeks exergame intervention on the heart rate variability (HRV) of women with fibromyalgia. First, 56 women with fibromyalgia were assessed for eligibility. A total of 55 women fulfilled the inclusion criteria and participated in this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A 24-weeks of exergames were completed by the exercise group in the university facilities. It was focused on the mobility, postural control, upper and lower limbs coordination, aerobic fitness and strength. A total of 120 min per week, divided into two sessions of 60 min, was completed. A short-term 5 min record at rest was used to assess the HRV. Time (SDNN and RMSSD) and non-linear indexes (Higuchi´s Fractal Dimension, SD1, SD2, ln stress score, and SD1/SD2) of HRV were extracted. Fifty participants (achieving an 89.28% of adherence), recruited from the local fibromyalgia association completed the study. They were randomly divided into an exercise (age = 54.04[8.45]) and a control group (52.72[9.98]). Significant interaction (group*time) effects in SDNN, ln stress score, SD2, and SD1/SD2 ratio were found. The EG showed an increase of SDNN and a decreased ln stress score and SD2. The CG showed an increased ln stress score, SD1/SD2. In conclusion, 24-weeks of exergame intervention based on the tool VirtualEx-FM improved the autonomic control in patients with fibromyalgia. However, significant effects on Higuchi´s fractal dimension were not found. This is the first study using exergame as a therapy in women with fibromyalgia which has led to an improvement the autonomic balance in these patients."
"To assess differences between secondary high myopia (SHM) due to congenital glaucoma and primary high myopia (PHM) and non-highly myopic eyes (NHM) in the relationships between axial length and Bruch’s membrane (BM) thickness and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) density. The histomorphometric study included human globes enucleated for reasons such as malignant uveal melanoma, end-stage painful secondary angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma. BM thickness and RPE cell density were measured upon light microscopy. The investigation included 122 eyes (mean axial length: 26.7 ± 3.7 mm; range: 20.0–37.0 mm): 7 eyes with SHM (axial length: 33.7 ± 2.1 mm; range: 31.0–37.0 mm), 56 eyes with PHM (mean axial length: 29.1 ± 2.4 mm; range: 26.0–36.0 mm) and 59 eyes in the NHM-group (axial length: 23.5 ± 1.3 mm; range: 20.0–25.5 mm). In the SHM group, longer axial length was associated with lower RPE cell density at the posterior pole (standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.92; non- standardized regression coefficient B: −2.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): −4.41, −1.10;P = 0.01), at the midpoint posterior pole/equator (beta: −0.87; B: −3.60; 95% CI: −6.48, −0.73;P = 0.03), and at the equator (beta: −0.88; B: −0.95; 95% CI: −1.68, −0.23; P = 0.02), but not at the ora serrata (P = 0.88). In the PHM-group and NHM group, RPE cell density at the posterior pole (P = 0.08) and ora serrata (P = 0.88) was statistically independent of axial length, while at the midpoint posterior pole/equator (P = 0.01) and equator (P < 0.001), RPE cell density decreased with longer axis. BM thickness in the SHM group decreased with longer axial length at the posterior pole (beta: −0.93;B: −0.29; 95% CI: −0.39, −0.14; P = 0.003), midpoint posterior pole/equator (beta: −0.79; B: −0.22; 95% CI: −0.42, −0.02; P = 0.035) and equator (beta: −0.84; B: −0.21; 95% CI: −0.37, −0.06; P = 0.017), while in the PHM-group and NHM-group, BM thickness at any ocular region was not statistically significantly correlated with axial length (all P > 0.05). In the SHM-group, but not in the PHM-group or NHM-group (P = 0.98), lower BM thickness was associated with lower RPE cell density (beta: 0.93; B: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.14; P = 0.007), while in the eyes without congenital glaucoma the relationship was not statistically significant. In SHM in contrast to PHM, BM thickness and RPE cell density decrease in a parallel manner with longer axial length. The findings fit with the notion of BM being a primary driver in the process of axial elongation in PHM as compared to SHM."
"Self-reported outcomes provide unique insights about an individual’s perceived manual ability after stroke. This study aimed at determining how the relationship between objective kinematic variables obtained from the target-to-target pointing task and self-reported manual ability varies during the first year in individuals after stroke. Sixty-six individuals from the Stroke Arm Longitudinal study at the University of Gothenburg (SALGOT) cohort were assessed using ABILHAND questionnaire and kinematic analysis at five timepoints between the 10th day and 12th month after stroke. Kinematic analysis was performed using a target-to-target pointing task in a virtual environment. Spearman’s correlation was used to determine the extent of correlation between ABILHAND logits and kinematic variables. The correlations varied with time within the first year after stroke. The correlations were low or very low early after stroke and became moderate to high after 6 months for objective measures of movement time and smoothness, but remained low to moderate for mean velocity and low for peak velocity. Due to this discrepancy between self-perceived and objective assessments of arm function, a combination of self-reported and objective assessments of upper limb should be used as outcome measures, especially in the acute and subacute stages after stroke."
"A boy exhibiting conjugated hyperbilirubinemia from birth, with elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (GGT), developed liver failure unusually early (7mo); GGT concomitantly normalized. ABCB4 disease was suspected, but no ABCB4 lesion was found. The boy was instead homozygous for ABCB11 variant c.1213 T>C (p.(Cys405Arg)), which is predicted to affect protein function. Both ABCB4 and ABCB11 were normally expressed in the explanted liver, with intralobular cholestasis; however, large-duct sclerosing cholangiopathy and ductal-plate malformation also were present. The primary-cilium constituent doublecortin domain containing 2 (DCDC2) was not expressed. Co-existence of ABCB11 disease and DCDC2 disease was proposed. Further testing identified homozygosity for the canonical-receptor splice-site variant c.294-2A>G (p.?) in DCDC2. Our report emphasizes the need to integrate clinical, histological, and genetic data in patients with neonatal cholestasis."
"Rewiring of energy metabolism and adaptation of mitochondria are considered to impact on prostate cancer development and progression. Here, we report on mitochondrial respiration, DNA mutations and gene expression in paired benign/malignant human prostate tissue samples. Results reveal reduced respiratory capacities with NADH-pathway substrates glutamate and malate in malignant tissue and a significant metabolic shift towards higher succinate oxidation, particularly in high-grade tumors. The load of potentially deleterious mitochondrial-DNA mutations is higher in tumors and associated with unfavorable risk factors. High levels of potentially deleterious mutations in mitochondrial Complex I-encoding genes are associated with a 70% reduction in NADH-pathway capacity and compensation by increased succinate-pathway capacity. Structural analyses of these mutations reveal amino acid alterations leading to potentially deleterious effects on Complex I, supporting a causal relationship. A metagene signature extracted from the transcriptome of tumor samples exhibiting a severe mitochondrial phenotype enables identification of tumors with shorter survival times."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The use of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) alone was not an accurate biomarker for HCC despite its high specificity. Therefore, we assessed the possible role of serum biomarkers that have been mentioned briefly in previous studies on Egyptian patients ion top of HCV. However these studies included small number of patients and did not assess the different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. In the current study we assessed 1) the expression levels of Golgi protein 37(GP73),Midkine (MDK) and Dickkopf-1(DKK-1) proteins separately and in combination at different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. GP73, MDK and DKK-1 proteins were assessed in 238 individuals divided into 4 groups (HCC, chronic HCV, and chronic HCV with cirrhosis and healthy subjects as a control) Serum levels of GP73, MDK, and DKK-1 were assessed in all subjects by ELISA. Serum levels of the studied markers were significantly higher in HCC compared to other groups (p < 0.001). The ROC curve analysis for the studied markers showed 1) 88.5% sensitivity, 80.6% specificity, 69% PPV, 93.5% NPV and (AUC 0.91)for MDK; 2) 93.6%, 86.9%, 77.7%, 96.5% for DKK-1. 3) 91%, 85%, 74.7%, 95% (AUC 0.96) for GP73 and 4) 74.4%, 84.4%, 69.9%, 87.1% (AUC 0.81) for AFP. Serum levels of GP73, MDK, and DKK-1 are comparable to AFP as promising predictor biomarkers for HCC patients from Egypt. A two markers panel including Gp73 and DKK-1 showed the highest specificity and sensitivity among different markers combinations."
"BackgroundFolate supplementation treatment is the first-line therapy in hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy). Up to 40% of HHcy patients do not benefit from folate therapy. Genetic and epigenetic factors of one-carbon metabolism (1-CM) might be identified as a predictor of folate supplementation treatment response. In the present study, we attempt to identify whether genetic and epigenetic factors might predict folate treatment response.MethodsA total of 230 patients with HHcy were involved in this prospective cohort study. Differences between baseline concentrations and concentrations obtained at 90 days of treatment were calculated to evaluate the treatment response. General linear models and Pearson correlation was used to explore associations among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA methylation, and folate treatment response. Finally, mediation analysis was performed to investigate whether DNA methylation of MTRR mediates the association between SNPs and treatment response.ResultsMTHFD rs1950902 and MTRR rs162036, rs1801394 was associated with the folate treatment response (P = 0.000, 0.048, and 0.043, respectively). CBS and CBS_2 DNA methylation was significantly associated with folate treatment response (P = 0.0009 and < 0.001). DNA methylation of MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR was also significantly associated with folate treatment response (P < 0.001). DNA methylation of MTRR and MTRR_1 mediated 40.71% and 40.47% of the effect of rs1801394 on folate treatment response, respectively.ConclusionsOur results indicated that the 1-CM gene SNPs and DNA methylation was associated with folate treatment response and can be further evaluated relationship between SNPs and DNA methylation in 1-CM with treatment response in a larger sample."
"A direct association has been shown between Cyclin D1 and C-myc gene expressions and the proliferation of human thyroid tumor cells. Our previous study showed that increased β catenin led to a reduction in disease-free probability in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. This study was designed to investigate Cyclin D1 and C-myc genes as targets for β catenin function in PTC and to determine the association between genes expression and staging, recurrence, metastasis, and disease-free survival of PTC. This study was conducted via a thorough investigation of available data from medical records as well as paraffin blocks of 77 out of 400 patients over a 10-year period. Cyclin D1 and C-myc gene expression levels were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate disease-free survival. Higher levels of Cyclin D1 and C-myc gene expressions were observed in patients with recurrence by 8.5 (P = 0.004) and 19.5 (p = 0.0001) folds, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between Cyclin D1 expression and the cumulative dose of radioactive iodine received by patients (r = −0.2, p value = 0.03). The ten-year survival rate in the patients included in this study was 98.25% while disease-free survival was 48.1%. Higher Cyclin D1 and C-myc gene expression levels were observed in patients with recurrence/distant metastasis. Inversely, lower expression of Cyclin D1 and C-myc genes were associated with better survival of patients (SD, 0.142-0.052) (Mantel-Cox test, P = 0.002). The enhancement of Cyclin D1 and C-myc gene expression may be a potential mechanism for recurrence and aggressiveness of PTC."
"Biological materials presenting early signs of cancer would be beneficial for cancer screening/diagnosis. In this respect, the suitability of potentially exploiting mucus in colorectal cancer was tested using infrared spectroscopy in combination with statistical modeling. Twenty-six paraffinized colon tissue biopsy sections containing mucus regions from 20 individuals (10 normal and 16 cancerous) were measured using mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging. A digital de-paraffinization, followed by cluster analysis driven digital color-coded multi-staining segmented the infrared images into various histopathological features such as epithelium, connective tissue, stroma, and mucus regions within the tissue sections. Principal component analysis followed by supervised linear discriminant analysis was carried out on pure mucus and epithelial spectra from normal and cancerous regions of the tissue. For the mucus-based classification, a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 83%, and an area under the curve performance of 95% was obtained. For the epithelial tissue-based classification, a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 88%, and an area under the curve performance of 89% was obtained. The mucus spectral profiles further showed contributions indicative of glycans including that of sialic acid changes between these pathology groups. The study demonstrates that infrared spectroscopic analysis of mucus discriminates colorectal cancers with high sensitivity. This concept could be exploited to develop screening/diagnostic approaches complementary to histopathology."
"Breast cancer risk is reduced by number of pregnancies and breastfeeding duration, however studies of breast changes during or after pregnancy are rare. Breast volume changes – although not linked to breast cancer risk – might be an interesting phenotype in this context for correlative studies, as changes of breast volume vary between pregnant women. Serum receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and its antagonist osteoprotegerin (OPG) were measured prospectively before gestational week 12, and three-dimensional breast volume assessments were performed. A linear regression model including breast volume at the start of pregnancy, RANKL, OPG, and other factors was used to predict breast volume at term. The mean breast volume was 413 mL at gestational week 12, increasing by a mean of 99 mL up to gestational week 40. In addition to body mass index and breast volume at the beginning of pregnancy, RANKL and OPG appeared to influence breast volume with a mean increase by 32 mL (P = 0.04) and a mean reduction by 27 mL (P = 0.04), respectively. Linking the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway with breast volume changes supports further studies aiming at analysing breast changes during pregnancy with regard to breast cancer risk."
"Utilizing historical clinical datasets to guide future treatment choices is beneficial for patients and physicians. Machine learning and feature selection algorithms (namely, Fisher’s discriminant ratio, Kruskal-Wallis’ analysis, and Relief-F) have been combined in this research to analyse a SEER database containing clinical features from de-identified thyroid cancer patients. The data covered 34 unique clinical variables such as patients’ age at diagnosis or information regarding lymph nodes, which were employed to build various novel classifiers to distinguish patients that lived for over 10 years since diagnosis, from those who did not survive at least five years. By properly optimizing supervised neural networks, specifically multilayer perceptrons, using data from large groups of thyroid cancer patients (between 6,756 and 20,344 for different models), we demonstrate that unspecialized and existing medical recording can be reliably turned into power of prediction to help doctors make informed and optimized treatment decisions, as distinguishing patients in terms of prognosis has been achieved with 94.5% accuracy. We also envisage the potential of applying our machine learning strategy to other diseases and purposes such as in designing clinical trials for unmasking the maximum benefits and minimizing risks associated with new drug candidates on given populations."
"Tumor cells often reprogram their metabolism for rapid proliferation. The roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in metabolism remodeling and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Through screening, we found that the lncRNA Actin Gamma 1 Pseudogene (AGPG) is required for increased glycolysis activity and cell proliferation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mechanistically, AGPG binds to and stabilizes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). By preventing APC/C-mediated ubiquitination, AGPG protects PFKFB3 from proteasomal degradation, leading to the accumulation of PFKFB3 in cancer cells, which subsequently activates glycolytic flux and promotes cell cycle progression. AGPG is also a transcriptional target of p53; loss or mutation of TP53 triggers the marked upregulation of AGPG. Notably, inhibiting AGPG dramatically impaired tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Clinically, AGPG is highly expressed in many cancers, and high AGPG expression levels are correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that AGPG is a potential biomarker and cancer therapeutic target."
"Primary health care (PHC) providers are at the front line of asthma management. To evaluate how planned asthma follow-up occurred in PHC and whether lung function tests were used, 203 patients were followed for 12 years as part of a real-life asthma cohort Seinäjoki Adult Asthma Study (SAAS). A total of 152 patients had visits in PHC attending on average to four planned contacts during 12-year follow-up corresponding to one visit every third year. National guideline recommends annual visits. Patients with ≥4 contacts seemed to have more difficult asthma and better adherence to inhaled corticosteroid medication. Lung function tests were performed on average in 87.5% of annual planned follow-up contacts. Spirometry was performed in 70%, 71% and 97% of all contacts depending on whether it was a contact to GP, nurse or both. Overall, the frequency of follow-up contacts was insufficient but PHC adherence to lung function testing was excellent."
"Nonsense mutations cause about 10% of genetic disease cases, and no treatments are available. Nonsense mutations can be corrected by molecules with nonsense mutation readthrough activity. An extract of the mushroom Lepista inversa has recently shown high-efficiency correction of UGA and UAA nonsense mutations. One active constituent of this extract is 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP). In Calu-6 cancer cells, in which TP53 gene has a UGA nonsense mutation, DAP treatment increases p53 level. It also decreases the growth of tumors arising from Calu-6 cells injected into immunodeficient nude mice. DAP acts by interfering with the activity of a tRNA-specific 2′-O-methyltransferase (FTSJ1) responsible for cytosine 34 modification in tRNATrp. Low-toxicity and high-efficiency UGA nonsense mutation correction make DAP a good candidate for the development of treatments for genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations."
"The transcription factor TCF7L2 is indispensable for intestinal tissue homeostasis where it transmits mitogenic Wnt/β-Catenin signals in stem and progenitor cells, from which intestinal tumors arise. Yet, TCF7L2 belongs to the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC), and tumor-suppressive functions of TCF7L2 were proposed. This apparent paradox warrants to clarify the role of TCF7L2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated TCF7L2 dependence/independence of CRC cells and the cellular and molecular consequences of TCF7L2 loss-of-function. By genome editing we achieved complete TCF7L2 inactivation in several CRC cell lines without loss of viability, showing that CRC cells have widely lost the strict requirement for TCF7L2. TCF7L2 deficiency impaired G1/S progression, reminiscent of the physiological role of TCF7L2. In addition, TCF7L2-negative cells exhibited morphological changes, enhanced migration, invasion, and collagen adhesion, albeit the severity of the phenotypic alterations manifested in a cell-line-specific fashion. To provide a molecular framework for the observed cellular changes, we performed global transcriptome profiling and identified gene-regulatory networks in which TCF7L2 positively regulates the proto-oncogene MYC, while repressing the cell cycle inhibitors CDKN2C/CDKN2D. Consistent with its function in curbing cell motility and invasion, TCF7L2 directly suppresses the pro-metastatic transcription factor RUNX2 and impinges on the expression of cell adhesion molecules. Altogether, we conclude that the proliferation-stimulating activity of TCF7L2 persists in CRC cells. In addition, TCF7L2 acts as invasion suppressor. Despite its negative impact on cell cycle progression, TCF7L2 loss-of-function may thereby increase malignancy, which could explain why TCF7L2 is mutated in a sizeable fraction of colorectal tumors."
"Although arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders are among the most frequent causes of mortality and morbidity, there has been little description of how the composition of thrombi and emboli depends on their vascular origin and age. We quantified the structure and composition of arterial and venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Arterial thrombi contained a surprisingly large amount of fibrin, in addition to platelets. The composition of pulmonary emboli mirrored the most distal part of venous thrombi from which they originated, which differed from the structure of the body and head of the same thrombi. All thrombi and emboli contained few biconcave red blood cells but many polyhedrocytes or related forms of compressed red blood cells, demonstrating that these structures are a signature of clot contraction in vivo. Polyhedrocytes and intermediate forms comprised the major constituents of venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli. The structures within all of the thrombi and emboli were very tightly packed, in contrast to clots formed in vitro. There are distinctive, reproducible differences among arterial and venous thrombi and emboli related to their origin, destination and duration, which may have clinical implications for the understanding and treatment of thrombotic disorders."
"Background/objectivesFew studies have examined the effects of the weight status at birth and preschool age on the risk of elevated blood pressure (EBP) in early childhood, and whether the effects can be modified by breastfeeding duration remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects of high birth weight (HBW) with overweight/obese or abdominal obesity on the risk of EBP in preschoolers, and further evaluate the effects classified by breastfeeding duration (<6 and ≥6 months).Subjects/methodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 in Zhuhai, China. Out of 2390 3–4-year-old preschoolers originally recruited, a total of 1899 were included in the analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of the weight status at the two age points and breastfeeding duration on the risk of EBP.ResultsPreschoolers with current overweight/obese had a 1.13-fold increased risk of EBP than those with persistent normal weight, irrespective of their birth weight. However, the preschoolers with HBW had no increased risk of EBP, when they became normal weight (OR 1.70, 0.78–3.72). Similar results were found for the current abdominal obesity and the risk of EBP. In addition, the EBP risk of obese status was minimized if preschoolers were breastfed for ≥6 months.ConclusionsObesity status at preschool age can increase the risk of EBP, irrespective of birth weight. However, this EBP risk can be mitigated if HBW changes to current normal weight. Longer breastfeeding duration can partially offset the risk of EBP in preschoolers with obesity status."
"Although certain microbial lipids are toxins, the structural features important for cytotoxicity remain unknown. Increased functional understanding is essential for developing therapeutics against toxic microbial lipids. Group B Streptococci (GBS) are bacteria associated with preterm births, stillbirths, and severe infections in neonates and adults. GBS produce a pigmented, cytotoxic lipid, known as granadaene. Despite its importance to all manifestations of GBS disease, studies towards understanding granadaene’s toxic activity are hindered by its instability and insolubility in purified form. Here, we report the synthesis and screening of lipid derivatives inspired by granadaene, which reveal features central to toxin function, namely the polyene chain length. Furthermore, we show that vaccination with a non-toxic synthetic analog confers the production of antibodies that inhibit granadaene-mediated hemolysis ex vivo and diminish GBS infection in vivo. This work provides unique structural and functional insight into granadaene and a strategy to mitigate GBS infection, which will be relevant to other toxic lipids encoded by human pathogens."
"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in cancer long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been known to play crucial roles in cancer development and progression by regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression. However, only a few lncRNAs with annotated functions in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been identified to date. In the present study, the expression of lncCMPK2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and positively correlated with clinical stages and lymphatic metastasis. The overexpression of lncCMPK2 promoted the proliferation and cell cycle transition of CRC cells. Conversely, the silencing of lncCMPK2 restricted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. lncCMPK2 was localized to the nucleus of CRC cells, bound to far upstream element binding protein 3 (FUBP3), and guided FUBP3 to the far upstream element (FUSE) of the c-Myc gene to activate transcription. lncCMPK2 also stabilized FUBP3. These results provide novel insights into the functional mechanism of lncCMPK2 in CRC progression and highlight its potential as a biomarker of advanced CRC and therapeutic target."
"Recently, we reported PPARα-dependent DNA demethylation of the Fgf21 promoter in the postnatal mouse liver, where reduced DNA methylation is associated with enhanced gene expression after PPARα activation. However, there is no direct evidence for the effect of site-specific DNA methylation on gene expression. We employed the dCas9-SunTag and single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-TET1 catalytic domain (TET1CD) system to induce targeted DNA methylation of the Fgf21 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. We succeeded in targeted DNA demethylation of the Fgf 21 promoter both in Hepa1-6 cells and PPARα-deficient mice, with increased gene expression response to PPARα synthetic ligand administration and fasting, respectively. This study provides direct evidence that the DNA methylation status of a particular gene may determine the magnitude of the gene expression response to activation cues."
"RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters express short non-coding RNAs and have been adopted for expression of microRNA, interference RNA, and CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA). Vectors incorporating H1 and U6 Pol III promoters are being applied for therapeutic genome editing, including multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 effects. We report a nucleosome-depleted, minimal U6 promoter, which when embedded within lentiviral long terminal repeat (LTR) regions, supports high level transcriptional activity. Furthermore, duplex minimal H1 & U6 promoters transcribed dual sgRNAs for simultaneous disruption of T cell receptor (TCR) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, supporting efficient generation of ‘universal’ CAR T cells."
"Metastatic colonization relies on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and the microenvironment in secondary organs. Here, we show that disseminated breast cancer cells evoke phenotypic changes in lung fibroblasts, forming a supportive metastatic niche. Colonization of the lungs confers an inflammatory phenotype in metastasis-associated fibroblasts. Specifically, IL-1α and IL-1β secreted by breast cancer cells induce CXCL9 and CXCL10 production in lung fibroblasts via NF-κB signaling, fueling the growth of lung metastases. Notably, we find that the chemokine receptor CXCR3, that binds CXCL9/10, is specifically expressed in a small subset of breast cancer cells, which exhibits tumor-initiating ability when co-transplanted with fibroblasts and has high JNK signaling that drives IL-1α/β expression. Importantly, disruption of the intercellular JNK-IL-1-CXCL9/10-CXCR3 axis reduces metastatic colonization in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models. These data mechanistically demonstrate an essential role for the molecular crosstalk between breast cancer cells and their fibroblast niche in the progression of metastasis."
"The paper presents the procedure for planning an experiment to create standard sets of reagents for a technetium-99m generator based on glucose derivatives. All stages are presented from researching the required quantities of a substance, a reducing agent, a stabilizer and auxiliary components to developing lyophilized kits and conducting quality control. The radiochemical purity of radiopharmaceuticals prepared on the basis of the developed kits ranged from 90.0 to 99.0%. We also showed the functional suitability of the developed preparations on C57B1/6j mice with an implanted malignant tumor - Lewis lung carcinoma."
"HA (Hyaluronic acid) filler, the most commonly used dermal filler, causes several side effects. HA-PN (Hyaluronic acid-Polynucleotide), a new composite filler, has excellent biocompatibility and induces tissue regeneration. In this study, we compare the efficacies and safety profiles of these fillers. The characteristics of HA and HA–PN fillers were compared using scanning electron microscopy and rheometry. No morphological difference was noted between the fillers. However, the latter had higher viscosity and elasticity values. The HA-PN filler induced higher cell migration than the HA filler in a wound healing assay. It was also found to stimulate better collagen synthesis in human and mouse fibroblasts. The HA and HA–PN fillers were injected into SKH1 hairless mice to determine changes in their volume for up to 24 weeks. Increased cell migration and collagen synthesis were observed in mice injected with the HA–PN complex filler. Although the safety and durability of the HA and HA–PN fillers were similar, the latter induced a lower transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 expression and caused less stimulation upon injection. In conclusion, HA–PN complex fillers can stimulate fibroblast growth and facilitate volume growth and skin regeneration."
"Tumour cell phagocytosis by antigen presenting cells (APCs) is critical to the generation of antitumour immunity. However, cancer cells can evade phagocytosis by upregulating anti-phagocytosis molecule CD47. Here, we show that CD47 blockade alone is inefficient in stimulating glioma cell phagocytosis. However, combining CD47 blockade with temozolomide results in a significant pro-phagocytosis effect due to the latter’s ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Increased tumour cell phagocytosis subsequently enhances antigen cross-presentation and activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in APCs, resulting in more efficient T cell priming. This bridging of innate and adaptive responses inhibits glioma growth, but also activates immune checkpoint. Sequential administration of an anti-PD1 antibody overcomes this potential adaptive resistance. Together, these findings reveal a dynamic relationship between innate and adaptive immune regulation in tumours and support further investigation of phagocytosis modulation as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy responses."
"In managing a patient with glioblastoma (GBM), a surgeon must carefully consider whether sufficient tumour can be removed so that the patient can enjoy the benefits of decompression and cytoreduction, without impacting on the patient’s neurological status. In a previous study we identified the five most important anatomical features on a pre-operative MRI that are predictive of surgical resectability and used them to develop a simple, objective, and reproducible grading system. The objective of this study was to apply an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the prediction of surgical resectability in patients with GBM. Prospectively maintained databases were searched to identify adult patients with supratentorial GBM that underwent craniotomy and resection. Performance of the ANN was evaluated against logistic regression and the standard grading system by analysing their Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves; Area Under Curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated and compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test with a value of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. In all, 135 patients were included, of which 33 (24.4%) were found to have complete excision of all contrast-enhancing tumour. The AUC and accuracy were significantly greater using the ANN compared to the standard grading system (0.87 vs. 0.79 and 83% vs. 80% respectively; p < 0.01 in both cases). In conclusion, an ANN allows for the improved prediction of surgical resectability in patients with GBM."
"Ileal neuroendocrine tumors (I-NETs) are the most common tumors of the small intestine. Although I-NETs are known for a lack of recurrently mutated genes, a majority of tumors do show loss of one copy of chromosome 18. Among the genes on chromosome 18 is MIR1-2, which encodes a microRNA, MIR1-3p, with high complementarity to the mRNA of CDK4. Here we show that transfection of neuroendocrine cell lines with MIR1-3p lowered CDK4 expression and activity, and arrested growth at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. Loss of copy of MIR1-2 in ileal neuroendocrine tumors associated with increased expression of CDK4. Genetic events that attenuated RB activity, including loss of copy of MIR1-2 as well as loss of copy of CDKN1B and CDKN2A, were more frequent in tumors from patients with metastatic I-NETs. These data suggest that inhibitors of CDK4/CDK6 may benefit patients whose I-NETs show loss of copy of MIR1-2, particularly patients with metastatic disease."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers to affect men worldwide. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is central to PCa and PCa therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of prostate cancer through modulation of signaling pathways. In the present study, we illustrate the functional significance and therapeutic benefit of miR-299-3p, an AR targeting microRNA, in PCa progression. We noted loss of expression of miR-299-3p in prostate tumors compared to noncancerous prostate tissues. Replenishment of miR-299-3p in C4-2B, 22Rv-1 and PC-3 cells contributed to cell cycle arrest, reduced proliferation, migration and increased expression of apoptotic markers. Additionally, overexpression of miR-299-3p induced a reduction of AR, PSA and VEGFA expression. AGO-RNA pulldown experiment showed enrichment of AR, VEGFA and miR-299-3p in C4-2B cells overexpressing miR-299-3p. miR-299-3p overexpression also inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition, expression of Slug, TGF-β3, phospho-AKT and phospho-PRAS40, but increased expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, miR-299 overexpression resulted in reduced tumor growth in xenograft models and increased drug sensitivity. Overall, this study has identified novel mechanisms of antitumor and antimigration function of miR-299-3p through modulation of AR and VEGFA signaling pathways which lead to improved drug sensitivity of PCa."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most lethal and prevalent malignancies in the world and was responsible for nearly 881,000 cancer-related deaths in 2018. Surgery and chemotherapy have long been the first choices for cancer patients. However, the prognosis of CRC has never been satisfying, especially for patients with metastatic lesions. Targeted therapy is a new optional approach that has successfully prolonged overall survival for CRC patients. Following successes with the anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) agent cetuximab and the anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab, new agents blocking different critical pathways as well as immune checkpoints are emerging at an unprecedented rate. Guidelines worldwide are currently updating the recommended targeted drugs on the basis of the increasing number of high-quality clinical trials. This review provides an overview of existing CRC-targeted agents and their underlying mechanisms, as well as a discussion of their limitations and future trends."
"Contemporary theories propose that dysregulation of emotional perception is involved in the aetiology of psychosis. 298 healthy adolescents were assessed at age 14- and 19-years using fMRI while performing a facial emotion task. Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) were assessed with the CAPE-42 questionnaire at age 19. The high PLEs group at age 19 years exhibited an enhanced response in right insular cortex and decreased response in right prefrontal, right parahippocampal and left striatal regions; also, a gradient of decreasing response to emotional faces with age, from 14 to 19 years, in the right parahippocampal region and left insular cortical area. The right insula demonstrated an increasing response to emotional faces with increasing age in the low PLEs group, and a decreasing response over time in the high PLEs group. The change in parahippocampal/amygdala and insula responses during the perception of emotional faces in adolescents with high PLEs between the ages of 14 and 19 suggests a potential ‘aberrant’ neurodevelopmental trajectory for critical limbic areas. Our findings emphasize the role of the frontal and limbic areas in the aetiology of psychotic symptoms, in subjects without the illness phenotype and the confounds introduced by antipsychotic medication."
"Study designQualitative study, using in-depth, and semi-structured interviews.ObjectiveTo identify the psychosocial challenges of social reintegration for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Iran.SettingPeople with SCI living in the community in Iran.MethodEleven individuals with SCI with a median time since injury of 12 years (between 9 and 20 years), two family members, and three specialists (two social workers and one physiotherapist) were selected by purposive sampling with maximum variation. In-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted and finally the data analyzed through qualitative content methodology.ResultsThe psychosocial challenges were categorized into four main categories and twelve subcategories: early crises (denial and disbelief; feelings of isolation and depression; dependency crisis; and a sudden change in the normal course of life), disabling society (stigma; discrimination; employment challenges; and educational restriction), environmental barriers to access (lack of barrier-free environments and transportation challenges), and inappropriate services delivery (incomprehensive rules and lack of specialized training).ConclusionsProviding various psychosocial services is essential for the social reintegration of people with SCI. This goal could be achieved by the provision of medical and physical rehabilitation services. The ultimate purpose of rehabilitation is to reintegrate individuals into society after injury or illness; thus, psychosocial issues must also be considered to ensure effective rehabilitation."
"Prevention and treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are presently limited, underscoring the necessity for further elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development and identifying new prevention and therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate a unique protumorigenic niche in the livers of Ncoa5+/− mouse model of HCC, which is characterized by altered expression of a subset of genes including p21WAF1/CIP1 and proinflammatory cytokine genes, increased putative hepatic progenitors, and expansions of activated and tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. Importantly, prophylactic metformin treatment reversed these characteristics including aberrant p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and subsequently reduced HCC incidence in Ncoa5+/− male mice. Heterozygous deletion of the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene alleviated the key features associated with the protumorigenic niche in the livers of Ncoa5+/− male mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis reveals that preneoplastic livers of Ncoa5+/− mice are similar to the livers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients as well as the adjacent noncancerous liver tissues of a subset of HCC patients with a relatively poor prognosis. Together, our results suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression is essential in the development of protumorigenic microenvironment induced by NCOA5 deficiency and metformin prevents HCC development via alleviating p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression and protumorigenic microenvironment."
"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a frequent cause of liver injury and acute liver failure. We aimed to review all hospitalized DILI cases in a tertiary Egyptian center from January 2015 through January 2016. Cases with elevated alanine aminotransferase more than 3-fold and/or alkaline phosphatase more than 2-fold the upper limit of normal value were prospectively recruited and followed for one year. Drug history, liver biopsy whenever feasible and application of Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) were the diagnostic prerequisites after exclusion of other etiologies of acute liver injury. In order of frequency, the incriminated drugs were: Diclofenac (31 cases, 41.3%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (14 cases, 18.7%), halothane toxicity (8 cases, 10.7%), ibuprofen (4 cases, 5.3%), Khat (3 cases, 4%), tramadol (3 cases, 4%), Sofosbuvir with ribavirin (2 cases, 2.7%), and acetylsalicylic acid (2 cases, 2.7%) with one offending drug in 93.3% of cases. Forty-four cases (58.7%) were males; while 56 cases (74.7%) had HCV related chronic liver disease. Thirty-two cases (42.7%) presented with pattern of hepatocellular injury, while 23 cases (30.7%) were with cholestasis, and 20 cases (20.7%) with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic injury. One case received a transplant (0.75%), 7 cases died (9.3%), 23 cases (30.6%) developed liver decompensation (hepatic encephalopathy and ascites), and 44 cases completely resolved (58.7%). In conclusion, Diclofenac is the commonest offender in DILI occurrence in an Egyptian cohort. Age and prothrombin concentration were the only predictors of unfavorable outcomes of DILI."
"Oral diseases (e.g., dental caries, periodontitis) are developed when the healthy oral microbiome is imbalanced allowing the increase of pathobiont strains. Common practice to prevent or treat such diseases is the use of antiseptics, like chlorhexidine. However, the impact of these antiseptics on the composition and metabolic activity of the oral microbiome is poorly addressed. Using two types of oral biofilms—a 14-species community (more controllable) and human tongue microbiota (more representative)—the impact of short-term chlorhexidine exposure was explored in-depth. In both models, oral biofilms treated with chlorhexidine exhibited a pattern of inactivation (>3 log units) and fast regrowth to the initial bacterial concentrations. Moreover, the chlorhexidine treatment induced profound shifts in microbiota composition and metabolic activity. In some cases, disease associated traits were increased (such as higher abundance of pathobiont strains or shift in high lactate production). Our results highlight the need for alternative treatments that selectively target the disease-associated bacteria in the biofilm without targeting the commensal microorganisms."
"The mode of action for oncolytic viruses (OVs) in cancer treatment is thought to depend on a direct initial cytotoxic effect against infected tumor cells and subsequent activation of immune cell responses directed against the neoplasm. To study both of these effects in a mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM), we employed murine GBM cells engineered to constitutively express the type I Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV1) HSV-1 receptor, nectin-1, to allow for more efficient infection and replication by oncolytic HSV (oHSV). These cells were further engineered with a surrogate tumor antigen to facilitate assays of T cell activity. We utilized MRI-based volumetrics to measure GBM responses after injection with the oHSV and bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to determine oHSV replicative kinetics in the injected tumor mass. We found increased infiltration of both surrogate tumor antigen- and oHSV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells within 7 days after oHSV injection. There was no increase in tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressing “exhaustion” markers, yet oHSV infection led to a reduction in PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in injected GBMs and an increase in IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells. There was a significant direct correlation between oHSV-mediated reduction in GBM volume and increased infiltration of both viral and tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, as well as oHSV intratumoral gene activity. These findings imply that CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity against both tumor and viral antigens as well as intratumoral oHSV gene expression are important in oHSV-mediated GBM therapy."
"The Shwachman-Bodian Diamond syndrome (SBDS)-associated gene, SBDS, is involved in rRNA synthesis and ribosome maturation, but the role of SBDS in cancer is largely elusive. In this study, we found that SBDS is often overexpressed or amplified in human cancers, and high level of endogenous SBDS is significantly associated with unfavorable prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of SBDS leads to p53 stabilization and activation through the ribosomal stress-RPL5/RPL11-MDM2 pathway, resulting in the repression of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Interestingly, ectopic SBDS in the nucleoplasm also suppresses tumor cell growth and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed SBDS triggered by, for example, ribosomal stress binds to the transactivation domain of p53 and perturbs the MDM2–p53 interaction, consequently leading to impaired p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Altogether, our finding for the first time demonstrates the dual functions of SBDS in cancer development by coordinating ribosome biogenesis and p53 activity."
"In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the switch from asexual multiplication to sexual differentiation into gametocytes is essential for transmission to mosquitos. The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I. These results clarify the functional role of PfAP2-G during sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis."
"This review summarizes the last decade of work by the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium, a global alliance of over 1400 scientists across 43 countries, studying the human brain in health and disease. Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of “big data” (i.e., genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first decade of ENIGMA’s activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors."
"Measles is an acute and highly contagious but vaccine-preventable infectious disease. Despite years of being considered eliminated, decreased vaccination rates have produced virus reemergence in several countries, including Brazil. Measles can be controlled through immunization programs, through which aim to achieve 95% coverage with two doses of the vaccine. Measles can also be controlled if suspected cases can be properly identified in order to contain outbreaks. This cross-sectional study determined the prevalence of measles antibodies and their correlation with rubella antibodies (resulting from the combination vaccine used in Brazil’s public immunization program) in individuals aged higher 10 years old in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo State, Brazil, participants of a prospective cohort of arbovirosis surveillance before virus reemergence in the country. Our findings presented that 32.9% of individuals aged 10–40 years old had not antibodies against measles; 39.3% of total individuals with documented evidence of measles vaccination did not have anti-measles IgG, though only 20.2% of individuals with documented evidence of rubella vaccination lacked anti-rubella IgG. Besides, the most of measles cases reported in the city, following the virus spreading in the country, occurred especially in groups defined by us as susceptible. Because the combination MMR vaccine is part of Brazil’s national vaccine schedule, the possible reasons for this relatively high rate of seronegativity need to be investigated further, once that it reflects outbreak risk."
"An updated Cochrane Review showed that maternal supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reduced preterm birth, offering a potential strategy for prevention. We hypothesised that pregnant women with obesity, at higher risk of preterm birth, would have low omega-3 fatty acid levels and may benefit from supplementation. Our study measured the omega-3 fatty acid levels of 142 participants from the Healthy Mums and Babies study, Counties Manukau, Auckland, New Zealand. Counties Manukau is a multi-ethnic community with high rates of socio-economic deprivation, obesity, and preterm birth. Red blood cell omega-3 fatty acid levels were measured from samples collected between 120 and 176 weeks’ gestation. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants in our study had similar or higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids to those reported in pregnant populations in Australia, Norway, China, and Germany. Our findings emphasise the importance of testing omega-3 fatty acid status before supplementing groups at risk of preterm birth."
"BackgroundUnsupervised learning methods, such as Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, are commonly used for the analysis of genomic platform data. Unfortunately, such approaches ignore the well-documented heterogeneous composition of prostate cancer samples. Our aim is to use more sophisticated analytical approaches to deconvolute the structure of prostate cancer transcriptome data, providing novel clinically actionable information for this disease.MethodsWe apply an unsupervised model called Latent Process Decomposition (LPD), which can handle heterogeneity within individual cancer samples, to genome-wide expression data from eight prostate cancer clinical series, including 1,785 malignant samples with the clinical endpoints of PSA failure and metastasis.ResultsWe show that PSA failure is correlated with the level of an expression signature called DESNT (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = [1.36, 1.7], P = 9.0 × 10−14, Cox model), and that patients with a majority DESNT signature have an increased metastatic risk (X2 test, P = 0.0017, and P = 0.0019). In addition, we develop a stratification framework that incorporates DESNT and identifies three novel molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.ConclusionsThese results highlight the importance of using more complex approaches for the analysis of genomic data, may assist drug targeting, and have allowed the construction of a nomogram combining DESNT with other clinical factors for use in clinical management."
"An increasing body of evidence has implicated the innate immune system in the causation of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are newly identified members of the lymphoid lineage that are important effectors of innate immunity. The role of ILCs in STEMI has not been explored. We characterized the ILCs present in peripheral blood of 176 STEMI patients and 52 controls. Patients were followed up for up to 23 months. Flow cytometry showed that the proportion of total ILCs and ILC1s were significantly increased compared with controls; contrary to ILC1s, the proportion of ILC2s among total ILCs decreased significantly during the acute phase of STEMI. ILC1s percentage was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). On multivariate Cox regression, the 3rd tertile of ILC1s was associated with a higher MACE rate compared with the 1st tertile (hazard ratio: 2.26; 95% confidence interval 1.56–3.27; P = 0.014). RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed increased expressions of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), and matrix metallopeptidase 9. Moreover, as active factors secreted by ILC1s, levels of interleukin (IL)−12 and IL-18 were significantly increased in STEMI patients. Increased ILC1s in patients with STEMI was associated with poor outcomes. Our findings suggest that ILC1s may play an important role in STEMI."
"The long-term outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) remain inconclusive. To address this issue, we conducted a nationwide registry-based study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) age 50 years or older who underwent allogeneic HCT in complete remission using RIC (n = 284) or myeloablative conditioning (MAC, n = 190) between 2002 and 2007. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 10.1 years for RIC recipients and 10.4 years for MAC recipients. The 10-year probabilities of overall survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 36.4%, 30.0%, and 35.7% for RIC recipients, and 39.8%, 26.3%, and 35.5% for MAC recipients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the conditioning intensity did not affect overall mortality (P = 0.184), relapse (P = 0.904), or non-relapse mortality (P = 0.387). For the 218 patients qualifying for propensity score-matched pairing (109 pairs), RIC was found to be associated with similar survival (P = 0.095) and relapse (P = 0.467), and significantly lower non-relapse mortality (P = 0.046) compared with MAC. Our results confirm the long-term efficacy of RIC allogeneic HCT for older patients with AML and mitigate concerns over an increase in late relapse."
"This study investigates the effects of intrauterine G-CSF on endometrial thickness, clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate in a recurrent implantation failure (RIF) group with normal endometrium. This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial with the involvement of 157 RIF group pati; ents. The RIF group was formed on the basis of the RIF criteria: “The failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after the transfer of at least four good-quality embryos in a minimum of three fresh or frozen cycles to a woman under the age of 40 years. The study sample included 82 patients in the G-CSF group who received G-CSF once a day on hCG. The procedure was performed by administering 30 mIU of Leucostim®(Filgrastim [G-CSF] 30 mIU/mL; DEM Medical, Dong-A; South Korea) through slow infusion into the endometrial cavity using a soft embryo transfer catheter. Normal saline of 1 mL was infused into the endometrial cavity in the same way in 75 patients in the control group. The standard ICSI procedure was used for all patients, and fresh cycle embryos were transferred on the third or fifth day. No statistically significant difference was identified in clinical pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates and live birth rates between the G-CSF group and the control group (p = 0.112, p = 0.171, p = 0.644, respectively), and no difference was observed between the two groups regarding endometrial thickness (p = 0.965). The intervention of administration G-CSF into the uterine cavity in RIF patients with normal endometrium, did not alter the endometrial thickness, clinical pregnancy rates, or live birth rates."
"Genetic polymorphisms of NEIL1 and NEIL2 maybe change protein function, and increased carcinogenesis. In this study, seven NEIL1 SNPs and three NEIL2 SNPs were selected. 400 CSCCs, 400 CIN III, and 1200 normal healthy controls were genotyped by mismatch amplification PCR. mRNA and protein expression of NEIL2 was measured in 92 freshly-obtained CSCC tumor tissues. The association between homozygote CC genotype of NEIL2 rs804270 with susceptible risk was gradually increased in CIN III (OR = 1.44) and CSCC (OR = 2.22). Carriers of C-allele (GC + CC) at rs804270 had a high risk of CSCC (OR = 1.46). The heterozygote GT genotype of rs8191664 was also closely related to the higher risk of CINIII (OR = 1.59) and CSCC (OR = 2.54). Carriers of T-allele (GT + TT) at rs8191664 had a high risk for CIN III (OR = 1.55) and CSCC (OR = 2.34). The genotypes of NEIL2 rs804270 (G/C) and rs8191664 (G/T) that were related to the higher risk for CIN III were CC-GG (OR = 1.42) and CC-GT (OR = 2.07). More notably, there was a greater risk for CSCC with the GC-GT (OR = 1.91), CC-GG (OR = 1.67), and CC-GT (OR = 6.18) genotypes. NEIL2 mRNA expression in CSCCs with the rs804270-CC genotype was lower expression than those in CSCCs with the rs804270-GG and rs804270-GC genotypes. Similarly, NEIL2 protein expression was significantly decreased in CSCCs with the rs804270-CC genotype. In summary, the two genetic polymorphisms (rs804270 and rs8191664) of NEIL2 gene were significantly associated to the increased susceptibility of CIN III or CSCC. This increased susceptibility maybe due to altered NEIL2 repair activity through altered protein expression, or changed structure of the functional domain. The genotypes of GC-GT, CC-GG, and CC-GT of rs804270 and rs8191664 of NEIL2 gene could act as a genetic predictive biomarker of susceptibility to CIN III and CSCC."
"The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonin signaling by rapid presynaptic reuptake. SERT activity is modulated by antidepressants, e.g., S-citalopram and imipramine, to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. SERT crystal structures reveal two S-citalopram binding pockets in the central binding (S1) site and the extracellular vestibule (S2 site). In this study, our combined in vitro and in silico analysis indicates that the bound S-citalopram or imipramine in S1 is allosterically coupled to the ligand binding to S2 through altering protein conformations. Remarkably, SERT inhibitor Lu AF60097, the first high-affinity S2-ligand reported and characterized here, allosterically couples the ligand binding to S1 through a similar mechanism. The SERT inhibition by Lu AF60097 is demonstrated by the potentiated imipramine binding and increased hippocampal serotonin level in rats. Together, we reveal a S1-S2 coupling mechanism that will facilitate rational design of high-affinity SERT allosteric inhibitors."
"Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Fields (nsPEF) have the potential to treat a variety of cancer types including melanoma, pancreatic and lung squamous cancers. Recent studies show that nsPEF-based cancer therapy may be improved further with the assistance of moderate heating of the target. A feedback-looped heating system, utilizing a 980-nm fiber optic laser, was integrated into nsPEF electrodes for tumor ablation. The laser beam profile was determined to be Gaussian using a knife-edge technique. Thermal properties of the biological target were evaluated based on the treatment area, penetration depth and thermal distribution due to laser irradiation with or without nsPEF. Synergistic effects between nsPEF and the moderately elevated temperature at the target was observed, resulting in enhanced overall survival tumor regression up to 50% in the treatment of lung squamous cell cancer in mice."
"Low maternal serum levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) are known to be associated with the development of pregnancy-related complications like small for gestational age infants, intrauterine fetal demise, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The study aims to find possible long-term correlations with the development of metabolic and cardiovascular complications in the mothers and their progeny in later life. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on consecutive unselected women screened for chromosomal anomalies in the first trimester of pregnancy between 2004 and 2010. PAPP-A values as well as clinical data collected at childbirth were considered. A maternal and neonatal follow-up was performed through a telephone interview with the mother during 2015. The body-mass-index and the presence of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus were evaluated. The analysis included 988 patients. The median time of follow-up was 7 years (IQR 6–9). Lower first trimester maternal blood PAPP-A quartiles were associated with small stature of the offspring (z-score 1st-2nd quartile 0.37 IQR −0.42 and 1.17 vs 3rd-4th quartile 0.67 IQR −0.17 and 1.36, p < 0.05). Furthermore, low first trimester PAPP-A in pregnancy without other gestations following the index one, in Kaplan-Meier analysis was associated to a significant increase of hypoglycemic agents use at 7 and 10 years (respectively 1.12% CI.95 0–2.38% and 5.45% CI.95 0–10.82%) compared to the control group of high first trimester PAPP-A values (0% CI.95 0–0%) (p < 0.05). Low PAPP-A serum levels in the first trimester of pregnancy are associated with short stature in offspring and de-novo development of maternal diabetes mellitus in later life."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported substantial single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), but the underlying functional variations in the GWAS risk loci are unclear. Here we show that the European MDD genome-wide risk-associated allele of rs12129573 at 1p31.1 is associated with MDD in Han Chinese, and this SNP is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a human-unique Alu insertion polymorphism (rs70959274) in the 5′ flanking region of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01360 (Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 1360), which is preferably expressed in human testis in the currently available expression datasets. The risk allele at rs12129573 is almost completely linked with the absence of this Alu insertion. The Alu insertion polymorphism (rs70959274) is significantly associated with a lower RNA level of LINC01360 and acts as a transcription silencer likely through modulating the methylation of its internal CpG sites. Luciferase assays confirm that the presence of Alu insertion at rs70959274 suppresses transcriptional activities in human cells, and deletion of the Alu insertion through CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing increases RNA expression of LINC01360. Deletion of the Alu insertion in human cells also leads to dysregulation of gene expression, biological processes and pathways relevant to MDD, such as the alterations of mRNA levels of DRD2 and FLOT1, transcription of genes involved in synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, learning or memory, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In summary, we identify a human-unique DNA repetitive polymorphism in robust LD with the MDD risk-associated SNP at the prominent 1p31.1 GWAS loci, and offer insights into the molecular basis of the illness."
"The recent literature has shown that vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) can be stratified into two prognostically relevant groups based on human papillomavirus (HPV) status. The prognostic value of p53 for further sub-stratification, particularly in the HPV-independent group, has not been agreed upon. This disagreement is likely due to tremendous variations in p53 immunohistochemical (IHC) interpretation. To address this problem, we sought to compare p53 IHC patterns with TP53 mutation status. We studied 61 VSCC (48 conventional VSCC, 2 VSCC with sarcomatoid features, and 11 verrucous carcinomas) and 42 in situ lesions (30 differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [dVIN], 9 differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesions [deVIL], and 3 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [HSIL/uVIN]). IHC for p16 and p53, and sequencing of TP53 exons 4–9 were performed. HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed in selected cases. We identified six major p53 IHC patterns, two wild-type patterns: (1) scattered, (2) mid-epithelial expression (with basal sparing), and four mutant patterns: (3) basal overexpression, (4) parabasal/diffuse overexpression, (5) absent, and (6) cytoplasmic expression. These IHC patterns were consistent with TP53 mutation status in 58/61 (95%) VSCC and 39/42 (93%) in situ lesions. Cases that exhibited strong scattered staining and those with a weak basal overexpression pattern could be easily confused. The mid-epithelial pattern was exclusively observed in p16-positive lesions; the basal and parabasal layers that had absent p53 staining, appeared to correlate with the cells that were positive for HPV-ISH. This study describes a pattern-based p53 IHC interpretation framework, which can be utilized as a surrogate marker for TP53 mutational status in both VSCC and vulvar in situ lesions."
"Defining the risks associated with diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation remains controversial. Our study aims to assess whether preoperative hemoglobin a1c and preoperative blood glucose levels are associated with an increased risk for postoperative infection in diabetic men. We performed a retrospective review of 932 diabetic patients undergoing primary penile prosthesis implantation from 18 high-volume penile prosthesis implantation surgeons throughout the United States, Germany, Belgium, and South Korea. Preoperative hemoglobin a1c and blood glucose levels within 6 h of surgery were collected and assessed in univariate and multivariate models for correlation with postoperative infection, revision, and explantation rates. The primary outcome is postoperative infection and the secondary outcomes are postoperative revision and explantation. In all, 875 patients were included in the final analysis. There were no associations between preoperative blood glucose levels or hemoglobin a1c levels and postoperative infection rates; p = 0.220 and p = 0.598, respectively. On multivariate analysis, a history of diabetes-related complications was a significant predictor of higher revision rates (p = 0.034), but was nonsignificant for infection or explantation rates. We conclude preoperative blood glucose levels and hemoglobin a1c levels are not associated with an increased risk for postoperative infection, revision, or explantation in diabetic men undergoing penile prosthesis implantation."
"ObjectiveNo single test can accurately identify neonatal late-onset sepsis (LOS). Our aim was to use clinical evaluation with laboratory tests to rapidly assess sepsis risk.Study designA retrospective case-control study was performed in a tertiary Neonatal Center during the years 2016–2019. Infants with bacteriologically confirmed LOS were compared with control infants. A clinical health evaluation score was assigned to each infant. A prediction model was developed and validated by multivariable analysis.ResultsThe study included 145 infants, 48 with sepsis, and 97 controls. LOS was independently associated with: sick appearance (OR: 5.7, 95% CI: 1.1–29.1), C-reactive protein > 0.75 (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 1.1–26.3), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 1.5 (OR: 6.7, 95% CI: 1.2–38.5). Our model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86–0.97).ConclusionsClinical evaluation with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein can rapidly identify LOS enabling decreased health costs and antibiotic use."
"Ascaris spp. is a major health problem of humans and animals alike, and understanding the immunogenicity of its antigens is required for developing urgently needed vaccines. The parasite-secreted products represent the most relevant, yet complex (>250 proteins) antigens of Ascaris spp. as defining the pathogen-host interplay. We applied an in vitro antigen processing system coupled to quantitative proteomics to identify potential CD4+ Th cell epitopes in Ascaris-secreted products. This approach considerably restricts the theoretical list of epitopes using conventional CD4+ Th cell epitope prediction tools. We demonstrate the specificity and utility of our approach on two sets of candidate lists, allowing us identifying hits excluded by either one or both computational methods. More importantly, one of the candidates identified experimentally, clearly demonstrates the presence of pathogen-reactive T cells in healthy human individuals against these antigens. Thus, our work pipeline identifies the first human T cell epitope against Ascaris spp. and represents an easily adaptable platform for characterization of complex antigens, in particular for those pathogens that are not easily amenable for in vivo experimental validation."
"Genetic-driven deregulation of the Wnt pathway is crucial but not sufficient for colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis. Here, we show that environmental glutamine restriction further augments Wnt signaling in APC-mutant intestinal organoids to promote stemness, and leads to adenocarcinoma formation in vivo via decreasing intracellular α-ketoglutarate (αKG) levels. αKG supplementation is sufficient to rescue low-glutamine-induced stemness and Wnt hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we found that αKG promotes hypomethylation of DNA and histone H3K4me3, leading to an upregulation of differentiation-associated genes and downregulation of Wnt target genes, respectively. Using organoids derived from patients with CRC and several in vivo CRC tumor models, we show that αKG supplementation suppresses Wnt signaling and promotes cellular differentiation, thereby significantly restricting tumor growth and extending survival. Together, our results reveal how the metabolic microenvironment impacts Wnt signaling and identify αKG as a potent antineoplastic metabolite for potential differentiation therapy for patients with CRC."
"The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are driven by oncogenic KIT signaling and can therefore be effectively treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate. However, most GISTs develop imatinib resistance through secondary KIT mutations. The type of resistance mutation determines sensitivity to approved second-/third-line TKIs but shows high inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that target KIT independently of the mutational status are intriguing. Inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery with bortezomib is effective in GIST cells through a dual mechanism of KIT transcriptional downregulation and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic histone H2AX but clinically problematic due to the drug’s adverse effects. We therefore tested second-generation inhibitors of the 20S proteasome (delanzomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib) with better pharmacologic profiles as well as compounds targeting regulators of ubiquitination (b-AP15, MLN4924) for their effectiveness and mechanism of action in GIST. All three 20S proteasome inhibitors were highly effective in vitro and in vivo, including in imatinib-resistant models. In contrast, b-AP15 and MLN4924 were only effective at high concentrations or had mostly cytostatic effects, respectively. Our results confirm 20S proteasome inhibitors as promising strategy to overcome TKI resistance in GIST, while highlighting the complexity of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery as a therapeutic target."
"Accumulating data suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in younger people (aged <40 years), referred to as young-onset T2DM, has a more rapid deterioration of β-cell function than is seen in later-onset T2DM. Furthermore, individuals with young-onset T2DM seem to have a higher risk of complications than those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As the number of younger adults with T2DM increases, young-onset T2DM is predicted to become a more frequent feature of the broader diabetes mellitus population in both developing and developed nations, particularly in certain ethnicities. However, the magnitude of excess risk of premature death and incident complications remains incompletely understood; likewise, the potential reasons for this excess risk are unclear. Here, we review the evidence pertaining to young-onset T2DM and its current and future burden of disease in terms of incidence and prevalence in both developed and developing nations. In addition, we highlight the associations of young-onset T2DM with premature mortality and morbidity."
"Recent studies showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) had effects on the progression of multiple tumors, but the role of PPARD and PPARG in glioma remains poorly understand. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in PPARD and PPARG with glioma risk and prognosis in the Chinese Han population. Seven polymorphisms (PPARD: rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049 and rs2206030; PPARG: rs2920503, rs4073770 and rs1151988) were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY system in 568 glioma patients and 509 healthy controls. The odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the association of PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms with glioma risk. The Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used to analysis interactions of genetic polymorphisms on glioma risk. Then, we conducted log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model to evaluate the relationship of PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms with glioma prognosis. We found PPARD polymorphisms (rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049) were significantly associated with glioma risk in multiple models (P < 0.05). Stratified analysis showed rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049 of PPARD significantly decreased risk of glioma in the subgroup of age > 40 and astrocytoma (P < 0.05). For male, PPARD rs1053049 had a strong relationship with glioma risk in allele (P = 0.041), dominant (P = 0.040) and additive (P = 0.040) models. The effect of PPARG rs2920503 on glioma risk was related to glioma grade (P < 0.05). MDR showed that a seven-locus model was the best polymorphisms interaction pattern. Moreover, surgery and chemotherapy had strongly impact on overall survival and progression free survival of glioma patients. Our findings suggested that PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms were associated with glioma risk and prognosis in the Chinese Han population, and further studies are need to confirm our results."
"Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as novel biomarkers for various diseases. But circulating biomarkers for predicting the radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have not been used in clinical practice. To screen out of differently expressed serum miRNAs from NPC patients with different radiosensitivity may be helpful for its individual therapy. NPC patients with different radiosensitivity were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RNA was isolated from serum of these NPC patients before treatment. We investigated the differential miRNA expression profiles using microarray test (GSE139164), and the candidate miRNAs were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis has been applied to estimate the diagnostic value. In this study, 37 serum-specific miRNAs were screened out from 12 NPC patients with different radiosensitivity by microarray test. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that hsa-miR-1281 and hsa-miR-6732-3p were significantly downregulated in the serum of radioresistant NPC patients (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the results of microarray test. ROC curves demonstrated that the AUC for hsa-miR-1281 was 0.750 (95% CI: 0.574–0.926, SE 87.5%, SP 57.1%). While the AUC for hsa-miR-6732-3p was 0.696 (95% CI: 0.507–0.886, SE 56.3%, SP 78.6%). These results suggested that hsa-miR-1281 and hsa-miR-6732-3p in serum might serve as potential biomarkers for predicting the radiosensitivity of NPC."
"Coronary artery lesion (CAL) caused by Kawasaki disease (KD) is currently the most common acquired heart disease in children in many countries. Nevertheless, there is no single useful marker existing for predicting CAL of KD. Recently, many reports have noted that N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be utilized as a biomarker to predict CAL. Thus, we perform a meta-analysis to ascertain the diagnostic value of NT-proBNP in detecting CAL of KD in the acute phase. PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched to detect relevant publications. Finally, eight eligible studies were included. The overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78–0.89) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68–0.75), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curves value (SROC) curve was 0.8582 ± 0.0531. Moreover, the overall sensitivity and specificity across five studies adopted the threshold of approximately 900 ng/L were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73–0.89) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68–0.76), respectively. SROC was 0.8868 ± 0.0486. This meta-analysis would be the first one to describe the role of NT-proBNP in detecting CAL of KD. We register this study with PROSPERO (CRD42019130083)."
"Approaches to deplete persistent HIV infection are needed. We investigated the combined impact of the latency reversing agent vorinostat (VOR) and AGS-004, an autologous dendritic cell immunotherapeutic, on the HIV reservoir. HIV+, stably treated participants in whom resting CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA (rca-RNA) increased after VOR exposure ex vivo and in vivo received 4 doses of AGS-004 every 3 weeks, followed by VOR every 72 hours for 30 days, and then the cycle repeated. Change in VOR-responsive host gene expression, HIV-specific T cell responses, low-level HIV viremia, rca-RNA, and the frequency of resting CD4+ T-cell infection (RCI) was measured at baseline and after each cycle. No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed among five participants. As predicted, VOR-responsive host genes responded uniformly to VOR dosing. Following cycles of AGS-004 and VOR, rca-RNA decreased significantly in only two participants, with a significant decrease in SCA observed in one of these participants. However, unlike other cohorts dosed with AGS-004, no uniform increase in HIV-specific immune responses following vaccination was observed. Finally, no reproducible decline of RCI, defined as a decrease of >50%, was observed. AGS-004 and VOR were safe and well-tolerated, but no substantial impact on RCI was measured. In contrast to previous clinical data, AGS-004 did not induce HIV-specific immune responses greater than those measured at baseline. More efficacious antiviral immune interventions, perhaps paired with more effective latency reversal, must be developed to clear persistent HIV infection."
"More than 20 unique diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease are caused by the abnormal aggregations of pathogenic proteins such as amylin, β-amyloid (Aβ), and α-synuclein. All pathogenic proteins differ from each other in biological function, primary sequences, and morphologies; however, the proteins are toxic when aggregated. Here, we investigated the cellular toxicity of pathogenic or non-pathogenic protein aggregates. In this study, six proteins were selected and they were incubated at acid pH and high temperature. The aggregation kinetic and cellular toxicity of protein species with time were characterized. Three non-pathogenic proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA), catalase, and pepsin at pH 2 and 65 °C were stable in protein structure and non-toxic at a lower concentration of 1 mg/mL. They formed aggregates at a higher concentration of 20 mg/mL with time and they induced the toxicity in short incubation time points, 10 min and 20 min only and they became non-toxic after 30 min. Other three pathogenic proteins, lysozyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and insulin, also produced the aggregates with time and they caused cytotoxicity at both 1 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL after 10 min. TEM images and DSC analysis demonstrated that fibrils or aggregates at 1 mg/mL induced cellular toxicity due to low thermal stability. In DSC data, fibrils or aggregates of pathogenic proteins had low thermal transition compared to fresh samples. The results provide useful information to understand the aggregation and cellular toxicity of pathogenic and non-pathogenic proteins."
"The gold standard for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is prostate biopsy. However, it remines controversial as an invasive mean for patients with PSA levels in the gray zone (4–10 ng/mL). This study aimed to develop strategy to reduce the unnecessary prostate biopsy. We retrospectively identified 235 patients with serum total PSA testing in the gray zone before prostate biopsy between 2014 and 2018. Age, PSA derivates, prostate volume and multiparametric magnetic imaging (mpMRI) examination were assessed as predictors for PCa and clinically significant PCa with Gleason score ≥ 7 (CSPCa). Univariate analysis showed that prostate volume, PSAD, and mpMRI examination were significant predictors of PCa and CSPCa (P < 0.05). The differences of diagnostic accuracy between mpMRI examination (AUC = 0.69) and other clinical parameters in diagnostic accuracy for PCa were not statistically significant. However, mpMRI examination (AUC = 0.79) outperformed prostate volume and PSAD in diagnosis of CSPCa. The multivariate models (AUC = 0.79 and 0.84 for PCa and CSPCa) performed significantly better than mpMRI examination for detection of PCa (P = 0.003) and CSPCa (P = 0.036) among patients with PSA level in the gray zone. At the same level of sensitivity as the mpMRI examination to diagnose PCa, applying the multivariate models could reduce the number of biopsies by 5% compared with mpMRI examination. Overall, our results supported the view that the multivariate model could reduce unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to diagnose PCa and CSPCa. Further prospective validation is required."
"The function of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1) and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be involved in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aims to explore the role of the HCN1 channel, BDNF, and mTOR in the actions of PTSD and to examine whether synaptic transmission or plasticity is involved in the regulation of this disease. In the present study, rats were exposed to the single prolonged stress and electric foot shock (SPS&S) procedure, which can induce PTSD-like behaviors in rats. ZD7288 was administered by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection to one experimental group to inhibit the function of the HCN1 ion channel while 8-Br-cAMP was administered to another group to activate the function of the HCN1 ion channel. A series of behavioral tests and biochemical assessments of certain proteins (HCN1, BDNF, and pmTOR) and synaptic ultrastructure in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hip) were then conducted. The SPS&S procedure induced apparent PTSD-like symptoms in rats. The administration of ZD7288 reduced the immobility time and escape latency time in the forced swim test (FST) and water maze test (WMT) with a decreased level of HCN1, upregulated BDNF-mTOR signaling pathways in the PFC and Hip, and synaptic ultrastructure changes in the PFC. In contrast, the administration of 8-Br-cAMP, which led to a higher level of HCN1 in PFC and Hip, resulted in a decreased number of entries to the open arms without significant change in total arm entries in the elevated plus maze test (EPMT) as well as a shorter center square distance and total distance in the open field test (OFT). Extended escape latency time was also observed in the WMT although there was no alteration of BDNF-mTOR signaling pathways and synaptic ultrastructure in the PFC and Hip. Overall, the inhibition of HCN1, which can alleviate PTSD-like behavior of rats by relieving depression and improving learning ability, may be related to the upregulated BDNF-mTOR signaling pathways and synaptic transmission."
"Tuberculosis prevalence is significantly higher among men than women. We have previously revealed an increased susceptibility of male C57BL/6 mice towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv. In the current study, we confirm the male bias for infection with the Beijing strain HN878. Males succumbed to HN878 infection significantly earlier than females. In both models, premature death of males was associated with smaller B cell follicles in the lungs. Analysis of homeostatic chemokines and their receptors revealed differences between H37Rv and HN878 infected animals, indicating different immune requirements for follicle formation in both models. However, expression of IL-23, which is involved in long-term containment of Mtb and lymphoid follicle formation, was reduced in male compared to female lungs in both models. Our study reveals sex differences in the formation of B cell follicles in the Mtb infected lung and we propose that impaired follicle formation is responsible for accelerated disease progression in males."
"One quarter of individuals with Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm) will develop airflow obstruction, but there are no established methods to identify these individuals. We examined the utility of FVC/TLC in identifying features of obstructive lung disease. The ratio of post-bronchodilator FVC and TLCCT from chest CT (FVC/TLCCT) among current and former smokers with PRISm (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 and FEV1 < 80%) in COPDGene was used to stratify subjects into quartiles: very high, high, low, and very low. We examined the associations between FVC/TLCCT quartiles and (1) baseline characteristics, (2) respiratory exacerbations, (3) progression to COPD at 5 years, and (4) all-cause mortality. Among participants with PRISm at baseline (n = 1,131), the very low FVC/TLCCT quartile was associated with increased gas trapping and emphysema, and higher rates of progression to COPD at 5 years (36% versus 17%; p < 0.001) relative to the very high quartile. The very low FVC/TLCCT quartile was associated with increased total (IRR = 1.65; 95% CI [1.07–2.54]) and severe (IRR = 2.24; 95% CI [1.29–3.89]) respiratory exacerbations. Mortality was lower in the very high FVC/TLCCT quartile relative to the other quartiles combined. Reduced FVC/TLCCT ratio in PRISm is associated with increased symptoms, radiographic emphysema and gas trapping, exacerbations, and progression to COPD."
"Rare sequence variants in the non-coding part of the BRCA genes are often reported as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which leave patients and doctors in a challenging position. The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenicity of the BRCA1 c.5407-25T>A variant found in 20 families from Norway, France and United States with suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. This was done by combining clinical and family information with allele frequency data, and assessment of the variant’s effect on mRNA splicing. Mean age at breast (n = 12) and ovarian (n = 11) cancer diagnosis in female carriers was 49.9 and 60.4 years, respectively. The mean Manchester score in the 20 families was 16.4. The allele frequency of BRCA1 c.5407-25T>A was 1/64,566 in non-Finnish Europeans (gnomAD database v2.1.1). We found the variant in 1/400 anonymous Norwegian blood donors and 0/784 in-house exomes. Sequencing of patient-derived cDNA from blood, normal breast and ovarian tissue showed that BRCA1 c.5407-25T>A leads to skipping of exon 23, resulting in frameshift and protein truncation: p.(Gly1803GlnfsTer11). Western blot analysis of transiently expressed BRCA1 proteins in HeLa cells showed a reduced amount of the truncated protein compared with wild type. Noteworthily, we found that a small amount of full-length transcript was also generated from the c.5407-25T>A allele, potentially explaining the intermediate cancer burden in families carrying this variant. In summary, our results show that BRCA1 c.5407-25T>A leads to partial skipping of exon 23, and could represent a likely pathogenic variant with reduced penetrance."
"Some studies show that children born after ICSI with non-ejaculated sperm are at increased risk of birth defects, other studies hold the opposite view. Does neonatal outcome including congenital malformations in children born after ICSI with percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) differ from neonatal outcome in children born after ICSI with ejaculated sperm? In this study, we examined the data from our IVF center from 2006 to 2016, to compare neonatal outcomes and rates of congenital malformations in children born after ICSI with different sperm origin. The results showed the clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate of non-ejaculated sperm group were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than ejaculated sperm group. There were 775 clinical pregnancies from non-ejaculated sperm group and 2,486 clinical pregnancies from ejaculated sperm group. Most of the clinical pregnancy outcomes were comparable between non-ejaculated sperm group and ejaculated sperm group (p > 0.05): the miscarriage rate per transfer, ectopic pregnancy rate per clinical pregnancy, induced abortion rate per clinical pregnancy and fetal deaths per clinical pregnancy. However, the live delivery rate per transfer of non-ejaculated sperm group was significantly higher than that of ejaculated sperm group (45.4% vs 36.7%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the comparison between the epididymal sperm, testicular sperm and ejaculated sperm groups showed there were no difference in the incidence of congenital malformations of babies live birth. Among singleton gestation live births, there were more girls than boys in both non-ejaculated sperm and ejaculated sperm group. In conclusion, the present study clearly showed no statistical increased risk in neonatal outcomes of newborns were found in the ICSI treatment with epididymal or testicular sperm. It may provide information for consultation for ICSI treatment in PESA or TESA patients."
"Delayed resorption of crown-covered bone is a critical cause of delayed tooth eruption. Traditional herbal medicines may be good auxiliary treatments to promote the resorption of crown-covered bone. This study was carried out to analyse the effect of isorhamnetin 3-O-neohesperidoside on receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and resorption of the crown-covered bone of the lower first molars in mice in vivo. Isorhamnetin 3-O-neohesperidoside promoted osteoclastogenesis and the bone resorption of mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and upregulated mRNA expression of the osteoclast-specific genes cathepsin K (CTSK), vacuolar-type H + -ATPase d2(V-ATPase d2), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). NFATc1, p38 and AKT signalling was obviously activated by isorhamnetin 3-O-neohesperidoside in osteoclastogenesis. Isorhamnetin 3-O-neohesperidoside aggravated resorption of crown-covered bone in vivo. In brief, isorhamnetin 3-O-neohesperidoside might be a candidate adjuvant therapy for delayed intraosseous eruption."
"Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) break down cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP, reducing the signaling of these important intracellular second messengers. Several unique families of phosphodiesterases exist, and certain families are clinically important modulators of vasodilation. In the current work, we have summarized the body of literature that describes an emerging role for the PDE4 subfamily of phosphodiesterases in malignancy. We have systematically investigated PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D isoforms and found evidence associating them with several cancer types including hematologic malignancies and lung cancers, among others. In this review, we compare the evidence examining the functional role of each PDE4 subtype across malignancies, looking for common signaling themes, signaling pathways, and establishing the case for PDE4 subtypes as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
"Fractures of the pelvic ring are a potential source of significant bleeding. Pelvic circumferential compression devices (PCCDs) can reduce and immobilize unstable fractures, but their hemostatic effect is unproven. Our aim was to assess the current practice of prehospital PCCD application and to identify factors available in the field predictive of significant pelvic ring injuries. All interventions (n = 13,435) in the Lausanne University Hospital Emergency Medical Service (EMS) were screened for PCCD placements from January 2008 to November 2014. Significant pelvic ring injuries (Tile types B or C) were considered as potentially benefitting from a PCCD. Data were extracted from the local prehospital registry. During the study period, 2366 trauma missions were performed. A PCCD was applied to 552/2366 (23%) patients. Significant pelvic ring injuries were present in 105/2366 (4.4%). Factors associated with the presence of significant pelvic ring injury were increased respiratory rate (OR 1.04), prolonged capillary refill time (OR 2.11), increased shock index (OR 3.91), pedestrians hit by a vehicle (OR 2.19), and presenting with falls from more than 2 m (OR 1.91). Among patients with a significant pelvic ring injury, a PCCD was placed in 79 (75%) and omitted in 26 (25%). One sixth of patients with a PCCD had a final diagnosis of significant pelvic ring injury. Further studies are needed to better understand which patient-, or accident-related factors are associated with prehospital PCCD omission among patients with significant pelvic ring injury."
"The therapeutic effects of C16, which is an inhibitor of RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), on growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. Huh7 cells, a human HCC cell line, were used. The effects of C16 on cell viability were evaluated with the MTT assay, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. Huh7 cells were grafted into immunodeficient mice, and the in vivo effects of C16 on tumorigenesis were examined. C16 suppressed proliferation of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Mouse models with xenograft transplantation showed that the inhibitor suppressed the growth of HCC cells in vivo. Moreover, C16 decreased angiogenesis in HCC tissue in the xenograft model. Consistent with these results in mice, transcript levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and factor-B, platelet-derived growth factor-A and factor-B, fibroblast growth factor-2, epidermal growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, which are angiogenesis-related growth factors, were significantly decreased by C16 in vitro. In conclusion, the PKR inhibitor C16 blocked tumor cell growth and angiogenesis via a decrease in mRNA levels of several growth factors. C16 may be useful in the treatment of HCC."
"Adaptive immunity is essential for pathogen and tumor eradication, but may also trigger uncontrolled or pathological inflammation. T cell receptor, co-stimulatory and cytokine signals coordinately dictate specific signaling networks that trigger the activation and functional programming of T cells. In addition, cellular metabolism promotes T cell responses and is dynamically regulated through the interplay of serine/threonine kinases, immunological cues and nutrient signaling networks. In this review, we summarize the upstream regulators and signaling effectors of key serine/threonine kinase-mediated signaling networks, including PI3K–AGC kinases, mTOR and LKB1–AMPK pathways that regulate metabolism, especially in T cells. We also provide our perspectives about the pending questions and clinical applicability of immunometabolic signaling. Understanding the regulators and effectors of immunometabolic signaling networks may uncover therapeutic targets to modulate metabolic programming and T cell responses in human disease."
"BackgroundA Mediterranean-style eating pattern is consistently associated with a decreased diabetes risk in Mediterranean and European populations. However, results in U.S. populations are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess whether a Mediterranean-style eating pattern would be associated with diabetes risk in a large, nationally representative U.S. cohort of black and white men and women.MethodsParticipants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study prospective cohort without diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline (visit 1, 1987–1989; n = 11,991) were included (mean age 54 years, 56% female, 75% white). Alternate Mediterranean Diet scores (aMed) were calculated using the mean dietary intake self-reported at visit 1 and visit 3 (1993–1995) or visit 1 only for participants censored before visit 3. Participants were followed from visit 1 through 31 December 2016 for incident diabetes. We used Cox regression models to characterize associations of aMed (quintiles as well as per 1-point higher) with incident diabetes adjusted for energy intake, age, sex, race and study center, and education (Model 1) for all participants then stratified by race and body mass index (BMI). Model 2 included potential mediating behavioral and clinical measures associated with diabetes. Results are presented as hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.ResultsOver a median follow-up of 22 years, there were 4024 incident cases of diabetes. Higher aMed scores were associated with lower diabetes risk [Model 1: 0.83 (0.73–0.94) for Q5 vs Q1 (p-trend < 0.001) and 0.96 (0.95–0.98) for 1-point higher]. Associations were stronger for black vs white participants (interaction p < 0.001) and weaker for obese vs normal BMI (interaction p < 0.01). Associations were attenuated but statistically significant in Model 2.ConclusionsAn eating pattern high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fish, and moderate in alcohol was associated with a lower risk of diabetes in a community-based U.S. population."
"Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is very common in older adults and has major impact on quality of life. The heritability of ARHI has been estimated to be around 50%. The present study aimed to estimate heritability and environmental contributions to liability of ARHI and the extent to which a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a recent genome-wide association study of questionnaire items regarding hearing loss using the UK Biobank is predictive of hearing loss in other samples. We examined (1) a sample from TwinsUK who have had hearing ability measured by pure-tone audiogram and the speech-to-noise ratio test as well as questionnaire measures that are comparable with the UK Biobank questionnaire items and (2) European and non-European samples from the UK Biobank which were not part of the original GWAS. Results indicated that the questionnaire items were over 50% heritable in TwinsUK and comparable with the objective hearing measures. In addition, we found very high genetic correlation (0.30–0.84) between the questionnaire responses and objective hearing measures in the TwinsUK sample. Finally, PRS computed from weighted UK Biobank GWAS results were predictive of both questionnaire and objective measures of hearing loss in the TwinsUK sample, as well as questionnaire-measured hearing loss in Europeans but not non-European subpopulations. These results demonstrate the utility of questionnaire-based methods in genetic association studies of hearing loss in adults and highlight the differences in genetic predisposition to ARHI by ethnic background."
"Treosulfan-based conditioning prior to allogeneic transplantation has been shown to have myeloablative, immunosuppressive, and antineoplastic effects associated with reduced non-relapse mortality (NRM) in adults. Therefore, we prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of treosulfan-based conditioning in children with hematological malignancies in this phase II trial. Overall, 65 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (35.4%), acute myeloid leukemia (44.6%), myelodysplastic syndrome (15.4%), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (4.6%) received treosulfan intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/m2/day (7.7%), 12 g/m2/day (35.4%), or 14 g/m2/day (56.9%) according to their individual body surface area in combination with fludarabine and thiotepa. The incidence of complete donor chimerism at day +28 was 98.4% with no primary and only one secondary graft failure. At 36 months, NRM was only 3.1%, while relapse incidence was 21.7%, and overall survival was 83.0%. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-vs.-host disease was 45.3% for grades I–IV and 26.6% for grades II–IV. At 36 months, 25.8% overall and 19.4% moderate/severe chronic graft-vs.-host disease were reported. These data confirm the safe and effective use of treosulfan-based conditioning in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. Therefore, treosulfan/fludarabine/thiotepa can be recommended for myeloablative conditioning in children with hematological malignancies."
"Blood damage (hemolysis) can occur during clinical procedures, e.g. dialysis, due to human error or faulty equipment, and it can cause significant harm to the patient or even death. We propose a simple technique to monitor changes in hemolysis levels continuously and in real time. As red blood cells rupture, the overall conductivity of the blood increases. Here, we demonstrate that small changes in porcine blood hemolysis can be detected through a simple resistance measurement."
"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common type of cancer that originates in the bone and usually occurs in young children. OSA patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, and the results were disappointing. Marine antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been the focus of antibiotic research because they are resistant to pathogen infection. Piscidin-1 is an AMP from the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis × M. chrysops) and has approximately 22 amino acids. Research has shown that piscidin-1 can inhibit bacterial infections and has antinociception and anti-cancer properties; however, the regulatory effects of piscidin-1 on mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells are still unknown. We aimed to identify the effects of piscidin-1 on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and apoptosis in OSA cells. Our analyses indicated that piscidin-1 has more cytotoxic effects against OSA cells than against lung and ovarian cancer cells; however, it has no effect on non-cancer cells. Piscidin-1 induces apoptosis in OSA cells, regulates mtROS, reduces mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and decreases adenosine 5′-triphosphate production, thus leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The mitochondrial antioxidant, mitoTempo, reduces the apoptosis induced by piscidin-1. Results suggest that piscidin-1 has potential for use in OSA treatment."
"Therapeutic success of B cell-targeting approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS) has intensified research into the pathogenic and regulatory roles these cells play in demyelinating disease. Dissecting the function of B cells in the MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is largely confined to induction with either the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein epitope MOG35–55 or the full-length recombinant human MOG protein, the latter representing the most-used B cell-dependent EAE model. There is a clear need to investigate B cell function in additional myelin antigen contexts. Unlike MOG35–55, where lack of B cells yields more severe disease, we show here that the immunodominant myelin proteolipid protein epitope (PLP178–191) elicited identical EAE in WT and μMT mice, suggesting an absence of B cell engagement by this peptide. We hypothesized that a longer PLP antigen may better engage B cells and designed a peptide encompassing the extracellular domains (ECD) of PLP. We demonstrate here that PLPECD-immunized B cell-deficient mice failed to exhibit EAE. In contrast, PLPECD induced EAE not only in WT mice, but in B cell-sufficient mice incapable of secreting antibodies, suggesting a predominant antigen presentation role. These results establish a novel, efficient B cell-dependent EAE model."
"Suprarenal aortic clamping during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair results in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in local (i.e. kidney) and distant (i.e. heart) tissue. To investigate perioperative approaches that mitigate IRI-induced tissue damage, Wistar rats underwent suprarenal aortic clamping either alone or in combination with short cycles of ischemic conditioning before and/or after clamping. Serum analysis revealed significant reduction in key biochemical parameters reflecting decreased tissue damage at systemic level and improved renal function in conditioned groups compared to controls (p < 0.05), which was corroborated by histolopathological evaluation. Importantly, the levels of DNA damage, as reflected by the biomarkers 8-oxo-G, γH2AX and pATM were reduced in conditioned versus non-conditioned cases. In this setting, NADPH oxidase, a source of free radicals, decreased in the myocardium of conditioned cases. Of note, administration of 5-HD and 8-SPT blocking key protective signaling routes abrogated the salutary effect of conditioning. To further understand the non-targeted effect of IRI on the heart, it was noted that serum TGF-β1 levels decreased in conditioned groups, whereas this difference was eliminated after 5-HD and 8-SPT administration. Collectively, conditioning strategies reduced both renal and myocardial injury. Additionally, the present study highlights TGF-β1 as an attractive target for manipulation in this context."
"We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of stationary tissue background phase correction for affecting precision in the measurement of Qp/Qs by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We enrolled consecutive patients (n = 91) referred for CMR at 1.5T without suspicion of cardiac shunt, and patients (n = 10) with verified cardiac shunts in this retrospective study. All patients underwent phase contrast flow quantification in the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. Flow was quantified using two semi-automatic software platforms (SyngoVia VA30, Vendor 1; Segment 2.0R4534, Vendor 2). Measurements were performed both uncorrected and corrected for linear (Vendor 1 and Vendor 2) or quadratic (Vendor 2) background phase. The proportion of patients outside the normal range of Qp/Qs was compared using the McNemar’s test. Compared to uncorrected measurements, there were fewer patients with a Qp/Qs outside the normal range following linear correction using Vendor 1 (10% vs 18%, p < 0.001), and Vendor 2 (10% vs 18%, p < 0.001), and following quadratic correction using Vendor 2 (7% vs 18%, p < 0.001). No patient with known shunt was reclassified as normal following stationary background correction. Therefore, we conclude that stationary tissue background correction reduces the number of patients with a Qp/Qs ratio outside the normal range in a consecutive clinical population, while simultaneously not reclassifying any patient with known cardiac shunts as having a normal Qp/Qs. Stationary tissue background correction may be used in clinical patients to increase diagnostic precision."
"Comprehensive development is critical for gut macrophages being essential for the intestinal immune system. However, the underlying mechanisms of macrophage development in the colon remain elusive. To investigate the function of branched-chain amino acids in the development of gut macrophages, an inducible knock-out mouse model for the branched-chain amino acid transporter CD98hc in CX3CR1+ macrophages was generated. The relatively selective deletion of CD98hc in macrophage populations leads to attenuated severity of chemically-induced colitis that we assessed by clinical, endoscopic, and histological scoring. Single-cell RNA sequencing of colonic lamina propria macrophages revealed that conditional deletion of CD98hc alters the “monocyte waterfall”-development to MHC II+ macrophages. The change in the macrophage development after deletion of CD98hc is associated with increased apoptotic gene expression. Our results show that CD98hc deletion changes the development of colonic macrophages."
"Dysregulation of peptide-activated pathways causes a range of diseases, fostering the discovery and clinical development of peptide drugs. Many endogenous peptides activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) — nearly 50 GPCR peptide drugs have been approved to date, most of them for metabolic disease or oncology, and more than 10 potentially first-in-class peptide therapeutics are in the pipeline. The majority of existing peptide therapeutics are agonists, which reflects the currently dominant strategy of modifying the endogenous peptide sequence of ligands for peptide-binding GPCRs. Increasingly, novel strategies are being employed to develop both agonists and antagonists, to both introduce chemical novelty and improve drug-like properties. Pharmacodynamic improvements are evolving to allow biasing ligands to activate specific downstream signalling pathways, in order to optimize efficacy and reduce side effects. In pharmacokinetics, modifications that increase plasma half-life have been revolutionary. Here, we discuss the current status of the peptide drugs targeting GPCRs, with a focus on evolving strategies to improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties."
"Pancreatic β-cell mass is known to be considerably altered during pregnancy and after parturition in rodents and humans. While β-cell mass increases during pregnancy and starts to return toward its original level after parturition, the cellular mechanisms by which β-cell mass during this period is regulated remains unclear. To address this issue in mice, we quantified β-cell mass and investigated the mechanisms underlying its regulation throughout the perinatal and postpartum period. The increased β-cell size and proliferation during pregnancy were significantly reduced shortly after parturition, whereas there was no evidence of β-cell reprogramming or increased apoptosis. Direct RNA sequencing of islets from pregnant and postpartum mice demonstrated dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, showing robust downregulation of cell cycle-related genes 1 day after parturition, and the reupregulation of serotonin metabolism-related genes at postpartum day 7. Serotonin synthesis was activated only in lactating females, accompanied by increased β-cell mass. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that β-cell mass is decreased shortly after parturition owing to reduced β-cell size and proliferation, and is subsequently increased, in association with lactation and serotonin biosynthesis."
"The tumor microenvironment is increasingly recognized as key player in cancer progression. Investigating heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment is important for understanding how specific cell types support cancer. Forming the vasculature, endothelial cells (ECs) are a prominent cell type in the microenvironment of both normal and neoplastic breast gland. Here, we sought out to analyze epithelial–endothelial cross talk in the breast using isogenic non-tumorigenic vs. tumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines and primary ECs. The cellular model used here consists of D492, a breast epithelial cell line with stem cell properties, and two isogenic D492-derived EMT cell lines, D492M and D492HER2. D492M was generated by endothelial-induced EMT and is non-tumorigenic while D492HER2 is tumorigenic, expressing the ErbB2/HER2 oncogene. To investigate cellular cross talk, we used both conditioned medium (CM) and 2D/3D co-culture systems. Secretome analysis of D492 cell lines was performed using mass spectrometry and candidate knockdown (KD), and overexpression (OE) was done using siRNA and CRISPRi/CRISPRa technology. D492HER2 directly enhances endothelial network formation and activates a molecular axis in ECs promoting D492HER2 migration and invasion, suggesting an endothelial feedback response. Secretome analysis identified extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) as potential angiogenic inducer in D492HER2. Confirming its involvement, KD of ECM1 reduced the ability of D492HER2-CM to increase endothelial network formation and induce the endothelial feedback, while recombinant ECM1 (rECM1) increased both. Interestingly, NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 expression was upregulated in ECs upon treatment with D492HER2-CM or rECM1 but not by CM from D492HER2 with ECM1 KD. Blocking endothelial NOTCH signaling inhibited the increase in network formation and the ability of ECs to promote D492HER2 migration and invasion. In summary, our data demonstrate that cancer-secreted ECM1 induces a NOTCH-mediated endothelial feedback promoting cancer progression by enhancing migration and invasion. Targeting this interaction may provide a novel possibility to improve cancer treatment."
"BackgroundDespite advances in the treatment of neuroblastoma, patients with high-risk disease still have dismal survival prognosis. Neuroblastoma cells display elevated expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins, suggesting that BH3-mimetics may be a promising treatment option. Here, we investigated the role of BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 in neuroblastoma.MethodsA panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and primary patient-derived cells were exposed to BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-2 (ABT-199), BCL-XL (A1331852) or MCL-1 (S63845). In addition, protein expression and interaction patterns were analysed using Western blotting and immunoprecipitation.ResultsAll tested BH3-mimetics were able to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines, indicating that not only BCL-2 but also BCL-XL and MCL-1 may be promising therapeutic targets. Primary patient-derived cells displayed highest sensitivity to A1331852, highlighting the important role of BCL-XL in neuroblastoma. Further analysis into the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis revealed that A1331852 and S63845 displaced proapoptotic proteins like BIM and BAK from their antiapoptotic targets, subsequently leading to the activation of BAX and BAK and caspase-dependent apoptosis.ConclusionsBy using selective BH3-mimetics, this study demonstrates that BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 are all relevant therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma. A1331852 and S63845 induce rapid apoptosis that is initiated following a displacement of BAK from BCL-XL or MCL-1, respectively."
"With the advent of whole genome-sequencing (WGS) studies, family-based designs enable sex-specific analysis approaches that can be applied to only affected individuals; tests using family-based designs are attractive because they are completely robust against the effects of population substructure. These advantages make family-based association tests (FBATs) that use siblings as well as parents especially suited for the analysis of late-onset diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, the application of FBATs to assess sex-specific effects can require additional filtering steps, as sensitivity to sequencing errors is amplified in this type of analysis. Here, we illustrate the implementation of robust analysis approaches and additional filtering steps that can minimize the chances of false positive-findings due to sex-specific sequencing errors. We apply this approach to two family-based AD datasets and identify four novel loci (GRID1, RIOK3, MCPH1, ZBTB7C) showing sex-specific association with AD risk. Following stringent quality control filtering, the strongest candidate is ZBTB7C (Pinter = 1.83 × 10−7), in which the minor allele of rs1944572 confers increased risk for AD in females and protection in males. ZBTB7C encodes the Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 7C, a transcriptional repressor of membrane metalloproteases (MMP). Members of this MMP family were implicated in AD neuropathology."
"At the initial stage of carcinogenesis, when RasV12-transformed cells are surrounded by normal epithelial cells, RasV12 cells are apically extruded from epithelia through cell competition with the surrounding normal cells. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)−2 is upregulated in normal cells surrounding RasV12-transformed cells. Addition of COX inhibitor or COX-2-knockout promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Furthermore, production of Prostaglandin (PG) E2, a downstream prostanoid of COX-2, is elevated in normal cells surrounding RasV12 cells, and addition of PGE2 suppresses apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. In a cell competition mouse model, expression of COX-2 is elevated in pancreatic epithelia harbouring RasV12-exressing cells, and the COX inhibitor ibuprofen promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Moreover, caerulein-induced chronic inflammation substantially suppresses apical elimination of RasV12 cells. These results indicate that intrinsically or extrinsically mediated inflammation can promote tumour initiation by diminishing cell competition between normal and transformed cells."
"The development of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics, a feasible and efficient method for exchanging complex clinical genomic data and interpretations, is described. FHIR Genomics is a subset of the emerging Health Level 7 FHIR standard and targets data from increasingly available technologies such as next-generation sequencing. Much care and integration of feedback have been taken to ease implementation, facilitate wide-scale interoperability, and enable modern app development toward a complete precision medicine standard. A new use case, the integration of the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) “meta-knowledgebase” into a third-party application, is described."
"Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMCs) are critical regulators of cancer growth. The different phenotypes, functions and therapeutic effects of these phagocytes have, however, been difficult to study. With the advent of single-cell-based technologies, a new ‘worldview’ is emerging: the classification of TIMCs into subtypes that are conserved across patients and across species. As the landscape of TIMCs is beginning to be understood, it opens up questions about the function of each TIMC subtype and its drugability. In this Perspective, we outline the current map of TIMC populations in cancer and their known and presumed functions, and discuss their therapeutic implications and the biological research questions that they give rise to. The answers should be particularly relevant for bioengineers, materials scientists and the chemical and pharmaceutical communities developing the next generation of cancer therapies."
"Pterygium morphology had great effect on corneal astigmatism and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in cataract patients. However, previous studies all focused on the pterygium surface parameters, the invasion degree or cross-sectional area of the pterygia into the corneal stroma were neglected. We studied the effect of three-dimensional parameters of pterygium on corneal astigmatism and IOL power prediction. We enrolled 81 eyes of 81 patients with primary nasal pterygium, measured the corneal astigmatism (Pentacam HR) and predicted IOL power change (IOLmaster500) before and after pterygium surgery. The three-dimensional parameters of pterygium (length, width, area, height and invasion cross-sectional area) were measured by slit lamp photography and Scheimpflug images. After pterygium surgery, corneal astigmatism decreased from 4.35 ± 4.24 to 1.07 ± 0.95 D and total corneal refractive power increased from 43.02 ± 1.96 to 43.95 ± 0.95 D (both P < 0.001). The predicted IOL power decreased from 22.87 ± 2.82 to 21.71 ± 2.85 D (P < 0.001) after surgery. Notably, 34 eyes (41.98%) had ≥3.0 D of pterygium induced astigmatism (PIA), and 33 eyes (40.74%) had ≥1.0 D of predicted IOL power change. PIA was independently influenced by the pterygium surface area (r = 0.43, P < 0.001) and cross-sectional area (r = 1.25, P = 0.018), while the predicted IOL power change was independently affected by the pterygium width (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Cataract surgeons could evaluate the effects of a pterygium according to its three-dimensional parameters and prepare an optimal surgical strategy for cataract combined pterygium patients."
"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative procedure in patients with Shwachman–Diamond syndrome (SDS) with bone marrow abnormalities. The results of 74 patients with SDS (6 acute myeloid leukemia, 7 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 61 bone marrow failure) treated with HSCT between 1988 and 2016 are reported. The donor source was: 24% sibling, 8% parent, and 68% unrelated donor. The stem cell source was: 70% bone marrow, 19% peripheral blood stem cells, and 11% cord blood. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 54% and reduced intensity in 46%. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 84% of patients after a median time of 17.5 days. Graft failure occurred in 15% of HSCTs. Grades I–IV acute and chronic GVHD were observed in 55% and 20% of patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 7.3 years (95% CI 4.8–10.2), 28 patients died for progression/relapse (7) or toxicity (21). The 5-year overall survival and nonrelapse mortality were 63.3% (95% CI 50.8–73.4) and 19.8% (95% CI 10.8–30.8), respectively. In conclusion, this is the largest series so far reported and confirms that HSCT is a suitable option for patients with SDS. Further efforts are needed to lower transplant-related toxicity and reduce graft failure."
"The scarcity of novel antibiotic compounds in a time of increasing resistance rates has begun to ring alarm bells at the highest echelons of government. Large new financial incentives to accelerate antibiotic research and development, such as market entry rewards (MERs), are being considered. However, there is little focus on how to sustain the efficacy of new, promising antibiotics reaching the market. Currently, inappropriate use of antibiotics is commonplace, which has accelerated resistance development. In an attempt to halt this trend, antibiotic stewardship policies are being implemented in many resource-rich settings. Unfortunately, this has not yet had an impact on the amount of antibiotics being prescribed globally. One important hurdle is misalignment of incentives. While governments and health services are incentivized to promote prudent use of this common good, pharmaceutical companies are incentivized to increase volume of sales to maximize profits. This problem must be addressed or else the major efforts going into developing new antibiotics will be in vain. In this paper we outline an approach to realign the incentives of pharmaceutical companies with wider antibiotic conservation efforts by making a staged bonus a component of an MER for antibiotic developers when resistance to their drug remains low over time. This bonus could address the lack of stewardship focus in any innovation-geared incentive."
"Carbapenemase-producing bacteria are a growing issue worldwide. Most phenotypic detection methods are culture-based, requiring long incubation times. We present a phenotypic screening panel for detection of carbapenem non-susceptibility and differentiation of carbapenemase classes and AmpC, the MALDI-TOF MS-based direct-on-target microdroplet growth assay (DOT-MGA). It was validated on 7 reference strains and 20 challenge Enterobacterales isolates. Broth microdilution (BMD) and combination disk test (CDT) were also performed, as well as PCR as reference method. The panel based on the synergy between meropenem and carbapenemase inhibitors, determined by incubating these substances with bacterial suspension on a MALDI-TOF MS target and subsequently assessing bacterial growth on the target’s spots by MS. After 4 hours of incubation, DOT-MGA correctly identified KPC, MBL and OXA (100% agreement with PCR). Detection of AmpC coincided with BMD and CDT but agreement with PCR was low, not ruling out false negative PCR results. DOT-MGA delivered more accurate results than BMD and CDT in a significantly shorter time, allowing for detection of carbapenem non-susceptibility, MIC determination and carbapenemase differentiation in one step."
"Contrast sensitivity is mostly used as a tool for testing aspects of visual functions. Infantile nystagmus is a pathological phenomenon that affects the spatial-temporal visual functions due to spontaneous oscillating movements of the eyes. We examined the spatial-temporal aspects of nystagmus perception, aiming to investigate the mechanisms underlying the deterioration of their visual performance. We tested the monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity of nystagmus and normally sighted subjects by measuring contrast detection of a Gabor target with spatial frequencies slightly above the cutoff threshold of each subject (nystagmus ~3; controls = 9cpd; presentation times 60–480 ms). The dominant eye of nystagmus revealed large differences over the non-dominant eye, highlighting the superiority of the dominant over the non-dominant eye in nystagmus. In addition, binocular summation mechanism was impaired in majority of the nystagmus subjects. Furthermore, these differences are not attributed to differences in visual acuity. Moreover, the visual performance in nystagmus continue to improve for longer presentation time compared with controls and was longer in the poor eye. Since the results are not due to differences in eye movements and strabismus, we suggest that the differences are due to developmental impairment in the visual system during the critical period."
"In-line filtration is increasingly used in critically-ill infants but its benefits, by preventing micro-particle infusion in very preterm neonates, remain to be demonstrated. We conducted a randomized controlled trial among very preterm infants allocated to receive either in-line filtration of all the intra-venous lines or standard care without filters. The primary outcome was differences greater than 20% in the median changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine serum concentrations measured at day 3 and day 8 (+/−1) using a Luminex multianalytic profiling technique. Major neonatal complications were analyzed as secondary predefined outcomes. We randomized 146 infants, assigned to filter (n = 73) or control (n = 73) group. Difference over 20% in pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration between day 3 and day 8 was not found statistically different between the two groups, both in intent-to-treat (with imputation) and per protocol (without imputation) analyses. The incidences of most of neonatal complications were found to be similar. Hence, this trial did not evidence a beneficial effect of in-line filtration in very preterm infants on the inflammatory response syndrome and neonatal morbidities. These data should be interpreted according to local standards in infusion preparation and central line management."
"Obesity is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality in the general population and is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We sought to evaluate the effect of overweight/obesity on clinical outcomes of patients with vasospastic angina (VA) at 1-year follow-up. The VA-KOREA (Vasospastic Angina in Korea) registry was a cohort of 11 centers from 2010 to 2015. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death (CD), new-onset arrhythmia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Using the body mass index (BMI) cut-off for Asians, 517 patients with definite VA were divided into either an overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 23 kg/m2) group (n = 378) or a normal weight (BMI 18.5–22.9 kg/m2) group (n = 139). The overweight/obese group showed a significantly lower rate of the primary endpoint composite (2.4% vs 7.9%, p = 0.004) and ACS (0.8% vs 4.3%, p = 0.007) than the normal weight group in the crude population. Similarly, in propensity-score matched analysis, the overweight/obese group showed a significantly lower rate of the primary endpoint composite (2.3% vs 8.4%, p = 0.006) and ACS (1.1% vs 4.6%, p = 0.035) than the normal weight group. However, there were no significant differences in CD and new-onset arrhythmia between the two groups in both the crude and propensity-score matched population. Independent predictors of the primary endpoint were overweight/obesity and dyslipidemia. In patients with VA, the overweight/obese group was associated with a favorable 1-year primary endpoint and the difference was mainly driven by the lower rate of ACS compared with the normal weight group."
"How the brain processes information accurately despite stochastic neural activity is a longstanding question1. For instance, perception is fundamentally limited by the information that the brain can extract from the noisy dynamics of sensory neurons. Seminal experiments2,3 suggest that correlated noise in sensory cortical neural ensembles is what limits their coding accuracy4,5,6, although how correlated noise affects neural codes remains debated7,8,9,10,11. Recent theoretical work proposes that how a neural ensemble’s sensory tuning properties relate statistically to its correlated noise patterns is a greater determinant of coding accuracy than is absolute noise strength12,13,14. However, without simultaneous recordings from thousands of cortical neurons with shared sensory inputs, it is unknown whether correlated noise limits coding fidelity. Here we present a 16-beam, two-photon microscope to monitor activity across the mouse primary visual cortex, along with analyses to quantify the information conveyed by large neural ensembles. We found that, in the visual cortex, correlated noise constrained signalling for ensembles with 800–1,300 neurons. Several noise components of the ensemble dynamics grew proportionally to the ensemble size and the encoded visual signals, revealing the predicted information-limiting correlations12,13,14. Notably, visual signals were perpendicular to the largest noise mode, which therefore did not limit coding fidelity. The information-limiting noise modes were approximately ten times smaller and concordant with mouse visual acuity15. Therefore, cortical design principles appear to enhance coding accuracy by restricting around 90% of noise fluctuations to modes that do not limit signalling fidelity, whereas much weaker correlated noise modes inherently bound sensory discrimination."
"Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is a measure of the abundance of somatic mutations in a tumor, which has been shown to be an emerging biomarker for both anti-PD-(L)1 treatment and prognosis; however, multiple challenges still hinder the adoption of TMB as a biomarker. The key challenges are the inconsistency of tumor mutational burden measurement among assays and the lack of a meaningful threshold for TMB classification. Here we describe a new method, ecTMB (Estimation and Classification of TMB), which uses an explicit background mutation model to predict TMB robustly and to classify samples into biologically meaningful subtypes defined by tumor mutational burden."
"In lobular capillary hemangioma (LCH), misnamed pyogenic granuloma, only sprouting angiogenesis (SA) has been considered. We assess the occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis (IA) in LCH and whether IA determines the specific and other focal patterns in the lesion. For this purpose, we study specimens of 120 cases of LCH, using semithin sections (in 10), immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy (in 20). In addition to SA, the results in LCH showed (1) intussusceptive phenomena, including pillars/folds and associated vessel loops, which encircled interstitial tissue structures (ITSs). (2) Two types of evolved loops depending on interendothelial contacts from opposite walls: (a) numerous interendothelial contacts, alternating with capillary-sized lumens (main capillary pattern of the lesion) and (b) few interendothelial contacts, wide open lumens, and intravascular transport of pillars/folds, which were arranged linearly, forming septa (focal sinusoidal-like pattern) or were irregularly grouped (focal intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia, IPEH-like pattern). In conclusion, we demonstrate that IA participates in synergistic interaction with SA in LCH development and that the prevalence of specific intussusceptive phenomena determines the predominant capillary pattern and associated sinusoidal hemangioma-like and IPEH-like patterns in the lesion, which suggest a role of IA as conditioner of vessel tumour/pseudo-tumour morphology."
"Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) exhibit higher suicide rates than the general population. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the high rate of suicidal behavior in SCZ remains poorly understood. MTHFR Ala222Val (C677T; rs 1801133) polymorphism has repeatedly demonstrated to play a pathological role in numerous mental disorders, but none of these studies focused on the susceptibility of suicidal behavior in SCZ. In the present cross-sectional study, we recruited 957 chronic inpatients with SCZ and 576 healthy controls to assess the psychopathological symptoms of SCZ and compare the frequency of the MTHFR Ala222Val genotype in both suicide attempters and non-attempters. Our results demonstrated no significant differences in MTHFR Ala222Val genotype and allele distributions between the SCZ patients and controls (p > 0.05), but showed a statistical significance in the distribution of Ala/Val genotype between suicide attempters and non-attempters (p < 0.05). Further logistic regression analysis showed that MTHFR Ala222Val genotype, psychopathological symptoms, number of cigarettes smoked per day and drinking status were related to suicide attempts in SCZ (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that MTHFR Ala222Val polymorphism and some clinical characteristics might confer susceptibility to suicide in patients with SCZ."
"Gut microbial enzymes, bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) are the gateway enzymes for bile acid (BA) modification in the gut. This activity is a promising target for developing innovative non-antibiotic growth promoters to enhance animal production and health. Compelling evidence has shown that inhibition of BSH activity should enhance weight gain by altering the BA pool, host signalling and lipid metabolism. We recently identified a panel of promising BSH inhibitors. Here, we address the potential of them as alternative, effective, non-antibiotic feed additives, for commercial application, to promote animal growth using a chicken model. In this study, the in vivo efficacy of three BSH inhibitors (caffeic acid phenethylester, riboflavin, carnosic acid) were evaluated. 7-day old chicks (10 birds/group) were either untreated or they received one of the specific BSH inhibitors (25 mg/kg body weight) via oral gavage for 17 days. The chicks in treatment groups consistently displayed higher body weight gain than the untreated chicks. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that BSH inhibitor treatment led to significant changes in both circulating and intestinal BA signatures in support of blunted intestinal BSH activity. Consistent with this finding, liver and intestinal tissue RNA-Seq analysis showed that carnosic acid treatment significantly altered expression of genes involved in lipid and bile acid metabolism. Taken together, this study validates microbial BSH activity inhibition as an alternative target and strategy to antibiotic treatment for animal growth promotion."
"The SHP-1 protein encoded by the Ptpn6 gene has been extensively studied in hematopoietic cells in the context of inflammation. A point mutation in this gene (Ptpn6spin) causes spontaneous inflammation in mice, which has a striking similarity to neutrophilic dermatoses in humans. Recent findings highlighted the role of signaling adapters and kinases in promoting inflammation in Ptpn6spin mice; however, the underlying transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report that SYK is important for driving neutrophil infiltration and initiating wound healing responses in Ptpn6spin mice. Moreover, we found that deletion of the transcription factor Ets2 in myeloid cells ameliorates cutaneous inflammatory disease in Ptpn6spin mice through transcriptional regulation of its target inflammatory genes. Furthermore, Ets-2 drives IL-1α-mediated inflammatory signaling in neutrophils of Ptpn6spin mice. Overall, in addition to its well-known role in driving inflammation in cancer, Ets-2 plays a major role in regulating IL-1α-driven Ptpn6spin-mediated neutrophilic dermatoses.
Model for the role of ETS-2 in neutrophilic inflammation in Ptpn6spin mice. Mutation of the Ptpn6 gene results in SYK phosphorylation which then sequentially activates MAPK signaling pathways and activation of ETS-2. This leads to activation of ETS-2 target genes that contribute to neutrophil migration and inflammation. When Ets2 is deleted in Ptpn6spin mice, the expression of these target genes is reduced, leading to the reduced pathology in neutrophilic dermatoses.

"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a sudden, needle-like pain in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve, can seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients. In chronic pain conditions including TN, increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may enhance pain transmission. This study compares the effect of palmatine administration on the expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) in trigeminal ganglion cells of Sprague-Dawley rats in a sham versus TN model group. Within 14 days of surgery, the mechanical allodynia threshold of the TN group was significantly lower than that of the sham group, while the TN + palmatine group had a higher mechanical pain sensitivity threshold than the TN group (p < 0.05). Real-time quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence showed that BDNF and TrkB expression in the TN group was higher than that in the sham group, while palmatine treatment could reverse these changes. Western blotting showed that palmatine treatment could reduce the elevated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in TN rats. Thus, the BDNF/TrkB pathway may be involved in the pain transmission process of TN, and palmatine treatment may reduce pain transmission by inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB pathway and suppressing ERK1/2 phosphorylation."
"Obesity predicts adverse microvasculature from childhood, potentially via inflammatory pathways. We investigated whether inflammation mediates associations between obesity and microvascular parameters. In 1054 children (mean age 11 years) and 1147 adults (44 years) from a cross-sectional study, we measured BMI (z-scores for children) and WHtR, Glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), an inflammatory marker, and retinal arteriolar and venular calibre. Causal mediation analysis methods decomposed a “total effect” into “direct” and “indirect” components via a mediator, considering continuous and categorical measures and adjusting for potential confounders. Compared to normal-weight BMI children, those with overweight or obesity had narrower arteriolar calibre (total effects −0.21 to −0.12 standard deviation (SD)): direct (not mediated via GlycA) effects were similar. Children with overweight or obesity had 0.25 to 0.35 SD wider venular calibre, of which 19 to 25% was mediated via GlycA. In adults, those with obesity had 0.07 SD greater venular calibre, which was completely mediated by GlycA (indirect effect: 0.07 SD, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.16). Similar findings were obtained with other obesity measures. Inflammation mediated associations between obesity and retinal venules, but not arterioles from mid-childhood, with higher mediation effects observed in adults. Interventions targeting inflammatory pathways may help mitigate adverse impacts of obesity on the microvasculature."
"Thyroid nodules are initially handled by fine needle aspiration (FNA). However, the stance of thyroid core needle biopsy (CNB) still is a challenge. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performances and conclusive rates of FNA and CNB for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules and to define effective indications of CNB. This retrospective study enrolled 1,060 consecutive thyroid nodules in 1,037 patients who underwent FNA from January 2008 to May 2008, and 462 consecutive nodules in 453 patients who underwent CNB from January 2014 to December 2015 at our institution. Ultrasound (US) features were classified according to the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) and Korean TIRADS (K-TIRADS). We compared diagnostic performances and conclusive rates between FNA and CNB groups. Propensity score matching was conducted to match FNA patients with CNB patients. After matching, the diagnostic performances for selecting surgical candidates and predicting malignancy were comparable between the two biopsy groups. Based on US findings, conclusive results were obtained significantly more in CNB than in FNA when thyroid nodules were classified as ACR TI-RADS or K-TIRADS category 4 and measured larger than 2 cm. Diagnostic performances between FNA and CNB were comparable. Superiority of CNB to FNA was found for thyroid nodules larger than 2 cm and classified as ACR TI-RADS or K-TIRADS category 4."
"While splicing changes caused by somatic mutations in SF3B1 are known, identifying full-length isoform changes may better elucidate the functional consequences of these mutations. We report nanopore sequencing of full-length cDNA from CLL samples with and without SF3B1 mutation, as well as normal B cell samples, giving a total of 149 million pass reads. We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3’ splice site changes associated with SF3B1 mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with SF3B1 mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms. Our work demonstrates the potential utility of nanopore sequencing for cancer and splicing research."
"Resistance development to one chemotherapeutic reagent leads frequently to acquired tolerance to other compounds, limiting the therapeutic options for cancer treatment. Herein, we find that overexpression of Rac1 is associated with multi-drug resistance to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Mechanistically, Rac1 activates aldolase A and ERK signaling which up-regulates glycolysis and especially the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This leads to increased nucleotides metabolism which protects breast cancer cells from chemotherapeutic-induced DNA damage. To translate this finding, we develop endosomal pH-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) which deliver Rac1-targeting siRNA together with cisplatin and effectively reverses NAC-chemoresistance in PDXs from NAC-resistant breast cancer patients. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that targeting Rac1 is a potential strategy to overcome acquired chemoresistance in breast cancer."
"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection."
"Fast liquid jets are investigated for use as a needle-free drug delivery system into an elastic tissue such as skin. Using smaller jet diameters in a repetitive regime can mitigate bruising and pain associated with current injectors. In this study, we aim to unravel the potential of the method to deliver liquids into biological tissues having higher elasticity than healthy skin (i.e >60 kPa). To address this challenge, we have implemented a laser-based jetting system capable of generating supersonic liquid microjets in a repetitive regime. We provide insights on the penetration of microjets into hydrogel samples with elastic modulus ranging from 16 kPa to 0.5 MPa. The unprecedented speeds of injection (>680 m/s) together with a newly introduced repetitive regime opens possibilities for usage in needle-free drug administration into materials with elasticity covering the wide spectrum of biological soft tissues like blood vessels, all skin layers, scarred or dried skin or tumors."
"Caspase-dependent apoptosis accounts for approximately 90% of homeostatic cell turnover in the body1, and regulates inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration2,3,4. How apoptotic cells mediate such diverse effects is not fully understood. Here we profiled the apoptotic metabolite secretome and determined its effects on the tissue neighbourhood. We show that apoptotic lymphocytes and macrophages release specific metabolites, while retaining their membrane integrity. A subset of these metabolites is also shared across different primary cells and cell lines after the induction of apoptosis by different stimuli. Mechanistically, the apoptotic metabolite secretome is not simply due to passive emptying of cellular contents and instead is a regulated process. Caspase-mediated opening of pannexin 1 channels at the plasma membrane facilitated the release of a select subset of metabolites. In addition, certain metabolic pathways continued to remain active during apoptosis, with the release of only select metabolites from a given pathway. Functionally, the apoptotic metabolite secretome induced specific gene programs in healthy neighbouring cells, including suppression of inflammation, cell proliferation, and wound healing. Furthermore, a cocktail of apoptotic metabolites reduced disease severity in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis and lung-graft rejection. These data advance the concept that apoptotic cells are not inert cells waiting for removal, but instead release metabolites as ‘good-bye’ signals to actively modulate outcomes in tissues."
"The most dreaded complication of penile prosthesis (PP) implantation is device infection. We sought to assess whether inadequate cleaning and sterilization of the reusable Furlow inserter may represent one of the last etiologies of infection in PP patients. We performed a prospective analysis of cultures of the Furlow inserter used for PP surgeries from seven centers between May 1st and June 30th, 2019. Once the Furlow was received for surgery, the surgical team inspected the device for assembly status (disassembled or not) and the presence of visible stains, pieces of tissue or discoloration on either the interior of the barrel or the plunger. Swab aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal cultures were then obtained from the internal component, after removal from the external component if assembled, and after introduction and immediate removal from the external component if disassembled. A total of 83 Furlow devices were cultured. Median age of surgical instrument was 4 years (2–10 years). Methods of sterilization included autoclave, wet autoclave, steam, and Sterad. Median time from sterilization was 3 days (1–22). On initial presentation, 79 devices were disassembled (95.1%) and 4 devices were still assembled (4.9%). Three external components were discolored (3.6%), while internal components demonstrated two stains (2.4%) indicative of improper cleaning which were thought to be residual blood products. Overall, 2/83 (2.4%) devices revealed positive swab cultures for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Swab cultures were negative for fungi and anaerobic bacteria. This patient cohort will continue to be followed to see if device infection occurs but it is unlikely to be meaningful since contaminated Furlows were discarded. Improper cleaning and/or sterilization of the Furlow Insertion Instrument may represent a source of infection for patients undergoing PP implantation."
"BackgroundDietary factors may play a role in bladder cancer etiology through modulation of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the inflammatory potential of diet, as estimated by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and bladder cancer risk.MethodsEnergy-adjusted DII (E-DIITM) scores were computed among 101,721 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression analysis stratified by sex, with adjustment for smoking status and other confounding.ResultsOver a median of 12.5 years of follow-up, 776 bladder cancer cases were diagnosed. E-DII scores were not associated with bladder cancer risk in the multivariable models. The HRs (95% CIs) in the highest compared with the lowest E-DII quintile were 0.90 (0.70–1.17) and 1.22 (0.72–2.06) for men and women, respectively. The associations did not differ when DII score was set as a continuous variable. The HRs (95% CIs) of one-unit increment in the E-DII for bladder cancer risk were 0.99 (0.96–1.02) and 1.01 (0.94–1.10) for men and women, respectively.ConclusionsOur study does not support an association between inflammatory potential of diet, as estimated by the E-DII, and bladder cancer risk."
"Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is a major indicator of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in cirrhotic patients and is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the outcome and mortality risk factors in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) who required prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) between 2006 and 2013 from two databases: Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and a hospital database. The hospital database yielded 58 LC patients (mean age: 65.3 years; men: 65.5%). The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher than in patients without LC. Based on the NHIRD database of PMV cases, patients were age-gender matched in a ratio of 1:2 for patients with and without LC. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was calculated. The mortality was higher in patients with LC (19.5%) than those without LC (18.12%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.0622). Based on the hospital database, risk factor analysis revealed that patients who died had significant higher MELD score than the survivors (18.9 vs 13.7, p = 0.036) and patients with MELD score of >23 had higher risk of mortality than patients with MELD score of ≤23 (adjusted OR:9.26, 95% CI: 1.96–43.8). In conclusion, the in-hospital mortality of patients with high MELD scores who required PMV was high. MELD scores may be useful predictors of mortality in these patients."
"Combined PARP and immune checkpoint inhibition has yielded encouraging results in ovarian cancer, but predictive biomarkers are lacking. We performed immunogenomic profiling and highly multiplexed single-cell imaging on tumor samples from patients enrolled in a Phase I/II trial of niraparib and pembrolizumab in ovarian cancer (NCT02657889). We identify two determinants of response; mutational signature 3 reflecting defective homologous recombination DNA repair, and positive immune score as a surrogate of interferon-primed exhausted CD8 + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Presence of one or both features associates with an improved outcome while concurrent absence yields no responses. Single-cell spatial analysis reveals prominent interactions of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and PD-L1 + macrophages and PD-L1 + tumor cells as mechanistic determinants of response. Furthermore, spatial analysis of two extreme responders shows differential clustering of exhausted CD8 + T-cells with PD-L1 + macrophages in the first, and exhausted CD8 + T-cells with cancer cells harboring genomic PD-L1 and PD-L2 amplification in the second."
"GPNMB is involved in multiple cellular functions including cell adhesion, stress protection and stem cell maintenance. In skin, melanocyte-GPNMB is suggested to mediate pigmentation through melanosome formation, but details of keratinocyte-GPNMB have yet to be well understood. We confirmed the expression of GPNMB in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) by reducing the expression using siRNA. A higher calcium concentration of over 1.25 mM decreased the GPNMB expression. Histological staining showed that GPNMB was expressed in the basal layer of normal skins but completely absent in vitiligo skins. The normal expression of GPNMB in nevus depigmentosus skin suggested that lack of GPNMB is characteristic of vitiligo lesional skins. IFN-γ and IL-17A, two cytokines with possible causal roles in vitiligo development, inhibited GPNMB expression in vitro. Approximately 4–8% of the total GPNMB expressed on NHEKs were released possibly by ADAM 10 as a soluble form, but the process of release was not affected by the cytokines. The suppressive effect of IFN-γ on GPNMB was partially via IFN-γ/JAK2/STAT1 signaling axis. Decreased GPNMB expression in keratinocytes may affect melanocyte maintenance or survival against oxidative stress although further studies are needed. These findings indicate a new target for vitiligo treatment, focusing on the novel role of IFN-γ and IL-17 in downregulating keratinocyte-GPNMB."
"Multi-systemic biological risk (MSBR), a proxy for allostatic load, is a composite index of biomarkers representing dysregulation due to responses to chronic stress. This study examined the association of an MSBR index with cancer mortality. The sample included n = 13,628 adults aged 20–90 from the NHANES III Linked Mortality File (1988–1994). The MSBR index included autonomic (pulse rate, blood pressure), metabolic (HOMAir, triglycerides, waist circumference), and immune (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein) markers. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall cancer mortality risk, according to quartiles (q) of the index. In multivariable models, compared to those in q1, q4 had a 64% increased risk for cancer mortality (HR = 1.64, 95% CI:1.13–2.40). The immune domain drove the association (HR per unit = 1.19, 95% CI:1.07–1.32). In stratified analyses, the HR for those with a BMI ≥ 25 was 1.12 per unit (95% CI:1.05–1.19) and those with a BMI < 25 was 1.04 per unit (95% CI:0.92–1.18). MSBR is positively associated with risk for cancer mortality in a US sample, particularly among those who are overweight or obese. The utilization of standard clinical measures comprising this index may inform population cancer prevention strategies."
"Machine learning is a powerful tool for creating computational models relating brain function to behavior, and its use is becoming widespread in neuroscience. However, these models are complex and often hard to interpret, making it difficult to evaluate their neuroscientific validity and contribution to understanding the brain. For neuroimaging-based machine-learning models to be interpretable, they should (i) be comprehensible to humans, (ii) provide useful information about what mental or behavioral constructs are represented in particular brain pathways or regions, and (iii) demonstrate that they are based on relevant neurobiological signal, not artifacts or confounds. In this protocol, we introduce a unified framework that consists of model-, feature- and biology-level assessments to provide complementary results that support the understanding of how and why a model works. Although the framework can be applied to different types of models and data, this protocol provides practical tools and examples of selected analysis methods for a functional MRI dataset and multivariate pattern-based predictive models. A user of the protocol should be familiar with basic programming in MATLAB or Python. This protocol will help build more interpretable neuroimaging-based machine-learning models, contributing to the cumulative understanding of brain mechanisms and brain health. Although the analyses provided here constitute a limited set of tests and take a few hours to days to complete, depending on the size of data and available computational resources, we envision the process of annotating and interpreting models as an open-ended process, involving collaborative efforts across multiple studies and laboratories."
"Acoustic manipulation is an emerging non-invasive method enabling precise spatial control of cells in their native environment. Applying this method for organizing neurons is invaluable for neural tissue engineering applications. Here, we used surface and bulk standing acoustic waves for large-scale patterning of Dorsal Root Ganglia neurons and PC12 cells forming neuronal cluster networks, organized biomimetically. We showed that by changing parameters such as voltage intensity or cell concentration we were able to affect cluster properties. We examined the effects of acoustic arrangement on cells atop 3D hydrogels for up to 6 days and showed that assembled cells spontaneously grew branches in a directed manner towards adjacent clusters, infiltrating the matrix. These findings have great relevance for tissue engineering applications as well as for mimicking architectures and properties of native tissues."
"Podocyte injury and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various glomerular diseases. ERdj3 (DNAJB11) and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) are ER chaperones lacking the KDEL motif, and may be secreted extracellularly. Since podocytes reside in the urinary space, we examined if podocyte injury is associated with secretion of KDEL-free ER chaperones from these cells into the urine, and if chaperones in the urine reflect ER stress in glomerulonephritis. In cultured podocytes, ER stress increased ERdj3 and MANF intracellularly and in culture medium, whereas GRP94 (KDEL chaperone) increased only intracellularly. ERdj3 and MANF secretion was blocked by the secretory trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A. Urinary ERdj3 and MANF increased in rats injected with tunicamycin (in the absence of proteinuria). After induction of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN), there was an increase in glomerular ER stress, and appearance of ERdj3 and MANF in the urine, coinciding with the onset of proteinuria. Rats with PHN were treated with the chemical chaperone, 4-phenyl butyrate (PBA), starting at the time of disease induction, or after disease was established. In both protocols, 4-PBA reduced proteinuria and urinary ER chaperone secretion, compared with PHN rats treated with saline (control). In conclusion, urinary ERdj3 and MANF reflect glomerular ER stress. 4-PBA protected against complement-mediated podocyte injury and the therapeutic response could be monitored by urinary ERdj3 and MANF."
"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cause of cerebral infarction. Once patients survive the acute phase, long-term prognosis is generally satisfactory. CVST patients who harbored risk factors known for poor prognosis (e.g., deterioration of consciousness/neurological functions and seizures) were oftentimes unresponsive to systemic heparin treatment. The advantage of combined endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT) and on-site chemical thrombolysis (OCT) plus systemic heparin for CVST over the heparin treatment alone has not been proved. A retrospective study was conducted to analyze consecutive patients with CVST from 2005 to 2015. Patients having clinical improvement or stable disease after heparin treatment were in I/S group; patients having continuous deterioration of consciousness/neurological functions and refractory seizures (despite the use of multiple anti-epileptic drugs) after heparin treatment were in D group. EMT and OCT were indicated for patients in D group. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed for statistical analysis. Safety issues included new-onset/progression of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) or procedure-related complications. Total thirty patients were included (I/S group = 16; D group = 14). In D group, the mean time frame from the start of heparin treatment to the endovascular treatment was 3.2 days. Compared with I/S group, all patients in D group had complete stenosis of the sinuses, with higher initial mRS, lower initial GCS, and more seizures (p = 0.006, 0.007, and 0.031, respectively), but no significant differences in the mRS at discharge (p = 0.504). Shorter length of thrombosis and lower initial mRS were associated with better outcomes (p = 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). Thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was associated with bad outcomes (p = 0.026). There were two patients (6.7%) with worsening symptomatic ICH, one in each group, managed surgically. The overall mortality of the study was 6.7% (2/30). Combined EMT and OCT after heparin treatment for severe CVST were reasonably safe, which might be considered as a salvage treatment in severe CVST patients who are unresponsive to heparin with heavy clot burden involving SSS in the acute phase. However, further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and validity."
"Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive T-cell lymphoma most commonly seen in children and young adults. The majority of pediatric ALCLs are associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation which fuses the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene with the Nucleophosmin (NPM) gene. The NPM-ALK fusion protein is a constitutively-active tyrosine kinase, and plays a major role in tumor pathogenesis. In an effort to advance novel diagnostic approaches and the understanding of the function of this fusion protein in cancer cells, we expressed in E. coli, purified and characterized human NPM-ALK fusion protein to be used as a standard for estimating expression levels in cultured human ALCL cells, a key tool in ALCL pathobiology research. We estimated that NPM-ALK fusion protein is expressed at substantial levels in both Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells (ca. 4–6 million molecules or 0.5–0.7 pg protein per cell; based on our in-house developed NPM-ALK ELISA; LOD of 40 pM) as compared to the ubiquitous β-actin protein (ca. 64 million molecules or 4.5 pg per lymphocyte). We also compared NPM-ALK/ β-actin ratios determined by ELISA to those independently determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and showed that the two methods are in good agreement."
"Unhealthful dietary habits are leading risk factors for life-altering diseases and mortality. Large-scale biobanks now enable genetic analysis of traits with modest heritability, such as diet. We perform a genomewide association on 85 single food intake and 85 principal component-derived dietary patterns from food frequency questionnaires in UK Biobank. We identify 814 associated loci, including olfactory receptor associations with fruit and tea intake; 136 associations are only identified using dietary patterns. Mendelian randomization suggests our top healthful dietary pattern driven by wholemeal vs. white bread consumption is causally influenced by factors correlated with education but is not strongly causal for coronary artery disease or type 2 diabetes. Overall, we demonstrate the value in complementary phenotyping approaches to complex dietary datasets, and the utility of genomic analysis to understand the relationships between diet and human health."
"The independent risk factors for death in patients admitted for asthma exacerbation have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to investigate these independent risk factors and the relationship between mortality and the prescription patterns of anti-asthmatic medications in patients admitted for asthma exacerbation. Using a nested case–control design, we identified 267 cases (death after asthma admission) and 1035 controls (survival after asthma admission) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2001 to 2010. Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We identified the independent risk factors for death as the comorbidities of pneumonia (aOR 3.82, 95% CI 2.41–6.05), genitourinary disease (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.17–2.62), septicemia (aOR 4.26, 95% CI 2.61–6.94), diabetes mellitus (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.30–3.38), arrhythmia (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14–3.50), and a history of asthmatic hospitalization (aOR 4.48, 95% CI 2.77–7.25). Moreover, the use of short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) and the dosage of oral corticosteroids (OCSs) >70 mg prednisolone during previous hospitalization (all p < 0.05) and the dosage of OCSs ≥110 mg prednisolone/month (aOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.08–4.50) during outpatient treatment independently increased the risk of death. The inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) ≥4 canisters/year (aOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19–0.78) independently reduced the risk of death. Specific comorbidities, asthma severity, and prescription patterns of SABA, OCSs, and ICSs were independently associated with mortality in patients admitted for asthma exacerbation. These results can be utilized to help physicians identify asthmatic patients who are at a higher mortality risk and to refine the management of the condition."
"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in atherothrombosis; however, their potential role as markers of risk is unclear. We investigated whether circulating NETs-related components associated with clinical outcome and hypercoagulability in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this observational cohort study, STEMI patients admitted for PCI (n = 956) were followed for median 4.6 years, recording 190 events (reinfarction, unscheduled revascularization, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, or death). Serum drawn median 18 hours post-PCI was used to quantify double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the more specific NETs markers myeloperoxidase-DNA and citrullinated histone 3. Levels of the NETs markers did not differ significantly between groups with/without a primary composite endpoint. However, patients who died (n = 76) had higher dsDNA compared to survivors (p < 0.001). Above-median dsDNA was associated with an increased number of deaths (54 vs. 22, p < 0.001). dsDNA in the upper quartiles (Q) was associated with increased mortality (Q3 vs. Q1 + 2 adjusted HR: 1.89 [95% CI 1.03 to 3.49], p = 0.041 and Q4 vs. Q1 + 2 adjusted HR: 2.28 [95% CI 1.19 to 4.36], p = 0.013). dsDNA was weakly correlated with D-dimer (rs = 0.17, p < 0.001). dsDNA levels associated with increased all-cause mortality, yet weakly with hypercoagulability in STEMI patients. The prognostic significance of potentially NETs-related markers requires further exploration."
"BackgroundThe combination of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AA/P) is used to treat metastatic prostate cancer, but molecular predictors of treatment response are not well elucidated. We evaluated plasma circulating tumor DNA- (ctDNA-) based copy number alterations (CNAs) to determine treatment-related predictive and prognostic biomarkers for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).MethodsSerial plasma specimens were prospectively collected from 88 chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients before and after 12 weeks of AA/P treatment. Sequencing-based CNA analyses were performed on 174 specimens. We evaluated CNA-associated 12-week responses for primary resistance, time to treatment change (TTTC) for secondary resistance, and overall survival for prognosis (P < 0.05). Associations with primary resistance were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the associations of CNAs with acquired resistance and overall survival.ResultsctDNA reduced by 3.89% in responders and increased by 0.94% in nonresponders (P = 0.0043). Thirty-one prostate cancer-related genes from whole genome CNAs were tested. AR and AR enhancer amplification were associated with primary resistance (P = 0.0039) and shorter TTTC (P = 0.0003). ZFHX3 deletion and PIK3CA amplification were associated with primary resistance (P = 0.026 and P = 0.017, respectively), shorter TTTC (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.0016, respectively), and poor survival (P = 0.0025 and P = 0.0022, respectively). CNA-based risk scores combining selected significant associations (AR, NKX3.1, and PIK3CA) at the univariate level with TTTC were predictive of secondary resistance (P = 0.0002). and established prognoses for survival based on CNAs in ZFHX3, RB1, PIK3CA, and OPHN1 (P = 0.002). Multigene risk scores were more predictive than individual genes or clinical risk factors (P < 0.05).ConclusionPlasma ctDNA CNAs and risk scores can predict mCRPC-state treatment and survival outcomes."
"A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to evaluate the interaction between residual limb and socket when considering the dynamic loads of the gait cycle. Fourteen transfemoral amputees participated in this study, where their residual limbs (i.e., soft tissues and bone), and their sockets were reconstructed. The socket and the femur were defined as elastic materials, while the bulk soft tissues were defined as a hyperelastic material. Each model included the donning, standing, and gait cycle phase, with load and boundary conditions applied accordingly. The influence of adding the dynamic loads related to the gait cycle were compared against the modelling of the static load equivalent to the standing position resulting in changes of 23% ± 19% in the maximum values and in an increase in the size of the regions where they were located. Additionally, the possible correspondence between comfort and the location of peak loadbearing at the residual-limb/socket interface was explored. Consequently, the comfort perceived by the patient could be estimated based on the locations of the maximum stresses (i.e., if they coincide with the pressure tolerant or sensitive regions of the residual limb)."
"We aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of rasagiline in pseudophakic patients who had surgery for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). This was a 6-month, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. Patients presenting with acute macula-off RRD were recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive rasagiline 1 mg/day or placebo for 7 days. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography were acquired 1 day before as well as 2 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. We screened 26 patients with RRD whereof 23 were eventually included and randomized. The primary outcome was final BCVA. Secondary outcomes included central retinal thickness (CRT) and adverse events (AE). We evaluated photoreceptor cells (prc) recovery through morphological measurements. The baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. BCVA significantly improved in both groups (letters gained: rasagiline 61.5 ± 18.1 vs placebo 55.3 ± 29.2, p = 0.56), but no significant inter-group difference was found at any visit. CRT was stable 3 weeks after surgery onwards, with no inter-group difference. No treatment-emergent AE occurred. Significant prc restoration was observed from 3 weeks to 6 months after surgery, without inter-group difference at either visit. Ellipsoid zone integrity (β = 0.517, p = 0.008) and foveal bulge (β = 0.387, p = 0.038) were significant predictors of good final BCVA. In conclusion, perioperative oral treatment with rasagiline 1 mg/day for 7 days did not show significant benefits on visual or anatomical outcomes in macula-off RRD patients."
"Liver damage upon exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), whether accidental or therapeutic, can contribute to liver dysfunction. Currently, radiotherapy (RT) is used for various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the treatment dose is limited by radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) with a high mortality rate. Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanisms of RILD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated RILD pathogenesis using various knockout mouse strains subjected to whole-liver irradiation. We found that hepatocytes released a large quantity of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) after irradiation. The cGAS-STING pathway in non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) was promptly activated by this dsDNA, causing interferon (IFN)-I production and release and concomitant hepatocyte damage. Genetic and pharmacological ablation of the IFN-I signaling pathway protected against RILD. Moreover, clinically irradiated human peri-HCC liver tissues exhibited substantially higher STING and IFNβ expression than non-irradiated tissues. Increased serum IFNβ concentrations post-radiation were associated with RILD development in patients. These results delineate cGAS-STING induced type 1 interferon release in NPCs as a key mediator of IR-induced liver damage and described a mechanism of innate-immunity-driven pathology, linking cGAS-STING activation with amplification of initial radiation-induced liver injury."
"Using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) as a single contrast agent, we investigated dual contrast cerebrovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for simultaneously monitoring macro- and microvasculature and their association with ischemic edema status (via apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat models. High-resolution T1-contrast based ultra-short echo time MR angiography (UTE-MRA) visualized size remodeling of pial arteries and veins whose mutual association with cortical ischemic edema status is rarely reported. ΔR2–ΔR2*-MRI-derived vessel size index (VSI) and density indices (Q and MVD) mapped morphological changes of microvessels occurring in subcortical ischemic edema lesions. In cortical ischemic edema lesions, significantly dilated pial veins (p = 0.0051) and thinned pial arteries (p = 0.0096) of ipsilateral brains compared to those of contralateral brains were observed from UTE-MRAs. In subcortical regions, ischemic edema lesions had a significantly decreased Q and MVD values (p < 0.001), as well as increased VSI values (p < 0.001) than normal subcortical tissues in contralateral brains. This pilot study suggests that MR-based morphological vessel changes, including but not limited to venous blood vessels, are directly related to corresponding tissue edema status in ischemic stroke rat models."
"Sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) is one of the most utilized surgeries in the management of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). We conducted a large-series study of SSLF in a tertiary center by an experienced urogynecologic team. The 453 women with POP who underwent SSLF at National Taiwan University Hospital in the period from 2002 to 2015 are reviewed. All patients received unilateral SSLF with Veronikis ligature carrier. Concomitant anterior colporrhaphy was performed in 75.3% of the cases and posterior colporrhaphy in 78.6%. The mean operation time was 92.3 ± 31.5 minutes. The intraoperative blood loss was 92.3 ± 91.4 ml. The objective cure rate was 82.5%, and 79 (17.5%) patients recurred. The Kaplan-Meier recurrence-free analysis showed a steep decline during the first postoperative year, and the yearly number of recurrent patients decreased as the follow-up period proceeded. A comparison of the site of recurrence found that anterior compartment prolapse was the most common with 57 cases (12.6%). Paravaginal repair is frequently implemented in the management of recurrent anterior prolapse. In conclusion, SSLF provides excellent support to the apex compartment, and our long-term results show that the anterior compartment is the most commonly encountered type of POP recurrence."
"This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the incidence, related factors and prognosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with malignancies in the Chinese cohort. We prospectively analyzed the IgG4-RD patients recruited in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2011 to August 2018 and identified patients diagnosed with IgG4-RD complicating malignancies. Data regarding demographics, clinical features, treatment and prognosis of IgG4-RD patients complicating malignancies were collected and compared to those of age- and sex-matched controls. Among the 587 Chinese patients with IgG4-RD, 17 malignancies were identified. Ten of them developed malignancy after the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, given a standard incidence ratio (SIR) of 2.78 (95%CI 1.33–5.12). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that autoimmune pancreatitis (OR = 6.230, 95%CI 1.559–24.907, p = 0.010) was positively associated with malignancy, whereas eosinophilia (OR = 0.094, 95%CI 0.010–0.883, p = 0.039) was negatively related with malignancies. During a median follow-up period of 61.4 ± 26.4 months, all patients with IgG4-RD and malignancies survived. We conclude that an increased incidence of malignancy was found in Chinese IgG4-RD cohort. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a potential risk factor, whereas eosinophilia is a possible protective factor for complicating malignancies."
"There is still debate as to the safety of non-palliative opioid administration to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients punctually treated for an acute complaint. All patients over 40 presenting at two university hospital emergency departments (Montréal Qc, Grenoble Fr) from March 2008 to September 2014 with dyspnea, abdominal pain or trauma were retrieved, and COPD patients were selected. Our primary endpoint was a composite criterion including invasive ventilation and death. Comparisons between visits in which opioid drugs were prescribed and those without opioids were performed using an inverse probability of treatment and censoring weight (IPTCW) estimator to adjust for baseline confounders. A survival weighted Cox model was used. 7799 visits by COPD patients were identified, corresponding to 4173 unique patients. Opioid drug prescription was reported in 1317 (16.9%) visits. After applying IPCTW weighting, opioid prescription was found to be associated with the composite criterion of poor clinical outcomes (HR = 4.73 (2.94; 7.61), p < 0.01). When taken separately, this association remained significant for invasive ventilation and death, but not for NIV. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the association, except for patients with trauma or abdominal pain as the main complaint. This excess risk is observed whatever the route of administration."
"Percutaneous puncture ethanol sclerotherapy is a simple, effective, minimally invasive, and inexpensive procedure to manage symptomatic simple renal cysts. We modified specific technical aspects to balance certain potential intraprocedural factors for ensuring minimal procedural pain and duration as well as maximal clinical therapeutic effects and evaluated the safety and efficacy of this modified technique. A total of 84 eligible patients underwent computed tomography-guided single-session ethanol sclerotherapy using the conventional (group A) or modified (group B) technique. In group B, the puncture route was modified from tansparenchymal to direct for reducing renal injury, and preinjection of low-dose intracystic lidocaine was used to control distending pain caused by ethanol injections; therefore, greater ethanol volumes could be injected for improving the resistance and contact of ethanol with the cyst wall, precluding the need for patient repositioning multiple times to decrease procedural duration. Visual analog scale score for pain and procedural time were significantly higher in group A than in group B. The complication rate was slightly higher in group A than in group B, but the success rate was comparable between the two groups. These results suggest that the modified technique is painless, time-saving, and injury-reducing and can thus improve medical care."
"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) belongs to a family of six IGF binding proteins. We previously found that IGFBP-3 exerts its cytotoxic effects on A549 (p53 wild-type) cell survival through a mechanism that depends on hyaluronan-CD44 interactions. To shed light on the mechanism employed, we used CD44-negative normal human lung cells (HFL1), A549, and H1299 (p53-null) lung cancer cells. A synthetic IGFBP-3 peptide (215-KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR-232) but not the mutant (K228AR230A), was able to bind hyaluronan more efficiently than the analogous sequences from the other IGFBPs. In a manner comparable to that of the IGFBP-3 protein, the peptide blocked hyaluronan-CD44 signaling, and more effectively inhibited viability of A549 cells than viability of either H1299 or HFL1 cell lines. Treatment with the IGFBP-3 protein or its peptide resulted in increased acetylcholinesterase concentration and activity in the A549 cell media but not in the media of either HFL1 or H1299, an effect that correlated with increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability. These effects were diminished upon the same treatment of A549 cells transfected with either p53 siRNA or acetylcholinesterase siRNA. Taken together, our results show that IGFBP-3 or its peptide blocks hyaluronan-CD44 signaling via a mechanism that depends on both p53 and acetylcholinesterase."
"Nickel (Ni) is the most frequent metal allergen and induces Th1-dependent type-IV allergies. In local skin, epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) and/or dermal dendritic cells (DCs) uptake antigens and migrate to draining lymph nodes (LNs). However, the subsets of antigen-presenting cells that contribute to Ni presentation have not yet been identified. In this study, we analyzed the Ni-binding capabilities of murine DCs using fluorescent metal indicator Newport Green. Elicitation of Ni allergy was assessed after intradermal (i.d.) injection of Ni-treated DCs into ear pinnae of Ni-sensitized mice. The Ni-binding capabilities of MHC class IIhi CD11cint migratory DCs were significantly stronger than those of MHC class IIint CD11chi resident DCs and CD11cint PDCA1+ MHC class IIint B220+ plasmacytoid DCs. Migratory DCs in skin-draining and mandibular LNs showed significantly stronger Ni-binding capabilities than those in mesenteric and medial iliac LNs. An i.d. injection of IL-1β induced the activation of LCs and dermal DCs with strong Ni-binding capabilities. Ni-binding LCs were detected in draining LNs after i.d. challenge with IL-1β and Ni. Moreover, an i.d. injection of Ni-treated DCs purified from skin-draining LNs elicited Ni-allergic inflammation. These results demonstrated that migratory DCs in skin-draining LNs have strong Ni-binding capabilities and elicit Ni allergy."
"A principal challenge in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is chemotherapy refractory disease. As such, there remains a critical need to identify key regulators of chemotherapy resistance in AML. In this study, we demonstrate that the membrane scaffold, CD82, contributes to the chemoresistant phenotype of AML. Using an RNA-seq approach, we identified the increased expression of the tetraspanin family member, CD82, in response to the chemotherapeutic, daunorubicin. Analysis of the TARGET and BEAT AML databases identifies a correlation between CD82 expression and overall survival of AML patients. Moreover, using a combination of cell lines and patient samples, we find that CD82 overexpression results in significantly reduced cell death in response to chemotherapy. Investigation of the mechanism by which CD82 promotes AML survival in response to chemotherapy identified a crucial role for enhanced protein kinase c alpha (PKCα) signaling and downstream activation of the β1 integrin. In addition, analysis of β1 integrin clustering by super-resolution imaging demonstrates that CD82 expression promotes the formation of dense β1 integrin membrane clusters. Lastly, evaluation of survival signaling following daunorubicin treatment identified robust activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream of PKCα and β1 integrin signaling when CD82 is overexpressed. Together, these data propose a mechanism where CD82 promotes chemoresistance by increasing PKCα activation and downstream activation/clustering of β1 integrin, leading to AML cell survival via activation of p38 MAPK. These observations suggest that the CD82-PKCα signaling axis may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating chemoresistance signaling in AML."
"ObjectiveDetermine whether management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia differs if one used end-tidal carbon monoxide (CO) corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc) measurements instead of direct antiglobulin test (DAT) results to assess the severity of hemolysis.Study designRetrospective chart review of infants with total bilirubin and ETCOc levels measured from July 2016 to August 2018. The reported treatment is the hypothetical management infants might have received had there been strict adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, rather than the actual management they received.ResultOnly 27.2% of 191 DAT(+) infants were hemolyzing based on ETCOc, while 29.1% of DAT (−) infants were hemolyzing based on ETCOc. Management of 18 (9.4%) infants differed depending if ETCOc or DAT were used to determine hemolysis. Eight fewer infants would have received phototherapy if ETCOc was used.ConclusionsETCOc is a more accurate determinant of hemolysis in the newborn, and its use can lead to less phototherapy."
"Corneal curvature, a highly heritable trait, is a key clinical endophenotype for myopia - a major cause of visual impairment and blindness in the world. Here we present a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of corneal curvature GWAS in 44,042 individuals of Caucasian and Asian with replication in 88,218 UK Biobank data. We identified 47 loci (of which 26 are novel), with population-specific signals as well as shared signals across ethnicities. Some identified variants showed precise scaling in corneal curvature and eye elongation (i.e. axial length) to maintain eyes in emmetropia (i.e. HDAC11/FBLN2 rs2630445, RBP3 rs11204213); others exhibited association with myopia with little pleiotropic effects on eye elongation. Implicated genes are involved in extracellular matrix organization, developmental process for body and eye, connective tissue cartilage and glycosylation protein activities. Our study provides insights into population-specific novel genes for corneal curvature, and their pleiotropic effect in regulating eye size or conferring susceptibility to myopia."
"Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is used to localize recurrent disease in prostate cancer (PCa). The tracer 68Ga-PSMA-11 visualizes lesions overexpressing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), while 11C-acetate visualizes lesions with increased anabolic metabolism. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PSMA-PET and acetate-PET in re-staging patients with biochemical relapse. Thirty PCa patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after primary curative therapy were prospectively evaluated. PET/CT examinations using 11C-acetate and 68Ga-PSMA-11 were performed. Identified lesions were categorized according to anatomical location and PET measurements were correlated with PSA at time of scan. Tumour lesions showed higher semi-quantitative uptake values on PSMA-PET than acetate-PET. PSMA-PET identified more lesions in 11 patients, fewer lesions in eight patients, and identical number of lesions in 11 patients. This study indicates better diagnostic performance of PSMA-PET, particularly in detecting lymph node (81% vs 60%, p = 0.02) and bone metastasis (95% vs 61%, p = 0.0001) compared to acetate-PET. However, 38% of PSMA-expressing metastases appear to be metabolically inactive and 15% of metabolically active metastases lack PSMA expression. Addition of PET with a metabolic tracer, such as 11C-acetate, might be beneficial before making treatment decisions."
"As the goal of mechanical thrombectomy is shifting toward mTICI-3 rather than mTICI-2b, we sought to clarify the limitation of the effect of mTICI-3. A post-hoc analysis of a registry of large-vessel occlusion stroke from 46 centers was conducted. Among 2,420 registered patients, 725 patients with anterior circulation occlusion who achieved successful reperfusion were analyzed. We compared outcomes between patients with mTICI-3 and mTICI-2b, and investigated how the effect of mTICI-3 changed according to baseline characteristics and time course. The proportion of patients with favorable outcomes (mRS 0–2 at day 90) was higher among patients with mTICI-3 compared to those with mTICI-2b (adjusted OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.49–2.97). There was no heterogeneity in the effect of mTICI-3 with respect to age, neurological deficit, alteplase use, occluded vessels, or infarct size. mTICI-3 was associated with favorable outcomes when the puncture-to-reperfusion time was <80 minutes (adjusted OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.52–3.41), but not when the puncture-to-reperfusion time was ≥80 minutes. A significant heterogeneity was found in the effect of mTICI-3 reperfusion across the puncture-to-reperfusion time subgroups (P for interaction = 0.025). Until when operators should continue the procedure after mTICI-2b has been achieved, needs to be studied."
"Metoidioplasty denotes the creation of a neophallus out of the hormonally hypertrophied clitoris. Construction of an esthetically acceptable male-like genitalia while enabling micturition in standing position are the primary goals. Herein, we aim to review the literature regarding masculinizing gender-affirming genital surgery in the form of metoidioplasty, focusing on the steps related to urethral lengthening and reconstruction, and describe the authors’ preferred surgical technique. Clitoral release, division of the urethral plate, native urethral lengthening with anterior vaginal wall flap, and neourethral tubularization using a combination of buccal mucosa graft and labia minora flap(s) seem to provide the best result in terms of urinary outcomes. This is reflected in a greater urethral length, higher probability of standing micturition, and lower incidence of fistula. Urethral complications, which can be encountered in up to 15% of the patients, may necessitate additional procedures. Some of the studies have reported successful penetrative intercourse following metoidioplasty. Case series about different metoidioplasty techniques do not allow head-to-head comparison due to non-standardized reporting and outcome assessment. Metoidioplasty can be offered to transgender men with sufficiently hypertrophied clitoris who wish to avoid a complicated, multistage, flap-based total phalloplasty, or for those individuals considering phalloplasty at a later date."
"Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are densely expressed in the striatum and have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia1,2. High-affinity binding of dopamine suggests that D2Rs detect transient reductions in dopamine concentration (the dopamine dip) during punishment learning3,4,5. However, the nature and cellular basis of D2R-dependent behaviour are unclear. Here we show that tone reward conditioning induces marked stimulus generalization in a manner that depends on dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice, and that discrimination learning refines the conditioning using a dopamine dip. In NAc slices, a narrow dopamine dip (as short as 0.4 s) was detected by D2Rs to disinhibit adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR)-mediated enlargement of dendritic spines in D2R-expressing spiny projection neurons (D2-SPNs). Plasticity-related signalling by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and A2ARs in the NAc was required for discrimination learning. By contrast, extinction learning did not involve dopamine dips or D2-SPNs. Treatment with methamphetamine, which dysregulates dopamine signalling, impaired discrimination learning and spine enlargement, and these impairments were reversed by a D2R antagonist. Our data show that D2Rs refine the generalized reward learning mediated by D1Rs."
"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), as an important component of the innate immune system, arise from a common lymphoid progenitor and are located in mucosal barriers and various tissues, including the intestine, skin, lung, and adipose tissue. ILCs are heterogeneous subsets of lymphocytes that have emerging roles in orchestrating immune response and contribute to maintain metabolic homeostasis and regulate tissue inflammation. Currently, more details about the pathways for the development and differentiation of ILCs have largely been elucidated, and cytokine secretion and downstream immune cell responses in disease pathogenesis have been reported. Recent research has identified that several distinct subsets of ILCs at skin barriers are involved in the complex regulatory network in local immunity, potentiating adaptive immunity and the inflammatory response. Of note, additional studies that assess the effects of ILCs are required to better define how ILCs regulate their development and functions and how they interact with other immune cells in autoimmune-related and inflammatory skin disorders. In this review, we will distill recent research progress in ILC biology, abnormal functions and potential pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmune-related skin diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma and inflammatory diseases, as well as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD), thereby giving a comprehensive review of the diversity and plasticity of ILCs and their unique functions in disease conditions with the aim to provide new insights into molecular diagnosis and suggest potential value in immunotherapy."
"Previous epidemiological studies focusing on the association between liver disease and atrial fibrillation (AF) show interesting but inconsistent findings. Patients with liver disease have a higher AF risk; however, it is unknown whether the liver fibrosis index can predict AF risk. The medical records of a healthy population undergoing routine health examinations at Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul National University Hospital, were reviewed retrospectively. After excluding subjects with a history of liver disease and known cardiovascular disease, 74,946 subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were evaluated. The mean age was 51 ± 11 years, and 71.9% were male. AF was found in 380 (0.5%) subjects. Using univariate analyses, age, male sex, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes were significantly associated with AF. The fibrosis 4 index (FIB 4) showed significant correlations with AF [unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.062 and 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.605–3.600, p = 0.000; adjusted OR 2.255 and 95% CI 1.744–2.915, p = 0.000, with cardiometabolic risk factors adjusted]. In conclusion, NAFLD subjects with higher FIB 4 were associated with increased AF risk. The noninvasive determination of liver fibrosis indices can have clinical implications on the early identification of NAFLD in patients at risk for AF."
"Study designSecondary analysis of a cross-sectional observation study.ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between skin ultrasound images and muscle damage in wheelchair basketball athletes, using skin blotting examinations of the ischial regions.SettingCommunity, Japan.MethodsFourteen elite wheelchair basketball athletes were recruited. We obtained data regarding participants’ characteristics. We undertook ultrasonographic images and quantitative skin blotting of the ischial region before and after training, and after rest.ResultsWe identified Category II and III pressure injuries in 2 of the 12 participants. Structural features were classified into four categories based on ultrasonographic features, namely, normal skin structure, unclear superficial and deep fascia, cloudy fat layer, and fat infiltration and low-echoic lesion/anechoic lesions. The muscle-type creatinine kinase (CK-M) level (median [interquartile range: IQR], 2.98 [2.80–3.47]) in the fat infiltration and low-echoic lesion/anechoic lesion group was significantly higher (1.43 [1.41–1.49]) than in a nonfat infiltration and low-echoic lesion/anechoic lesion group after training (p = 0.03). The interleukin-6 (IL-6) level (median [IQR], 23.5 [16.15–58.97]) in the fat infiltration and low-echoic lesion/anechoic lesion group was significantly higher (1.94 [1.74–4.44]) than in the nonfat infiltration and low-echoic lesion/anechoic lesion group after rest (mean difference = −25.4, 95% CI −61.1 to 10.7, p = 0.03).ConclusionsThe combination of ultrasonographic images and skin blotting using CK-M and IL-6, could detect early deep tissue damage in wheelchair athletes. These techniques could be potentially useful in the treatment and prevention of pressure injuries.SponsorshipThis study was supported in part by YAMAHA Motor Foundation for Sports."
"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Reactive oxygen species and epithelial apoptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent non-apoptotic form of cell death, mediates its effects in part by promoting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of ferroptosis decreases clinical symptoms in experimental models of ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal failure and heart injury. This study investigated the roles of inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) and Nrf2 in ferroptosis and their potential therapeutic effects in intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury. Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI was induced in wild-type and Nrf2−/− mice. The mice were treated with erastin followed by liproxstatin-1. Ferroptosis-related factors in mice with ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury or in mouse lung epithelial-2 cells with hypoxia/regeneration (HR)-induced ALI were measured by western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. Ferroptosis contributed to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI in vivo. iASPP inhibited ferroptosis and alleviated intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury, and iASPP-mediated protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI was dependent on Nrf2 signaling. HR-induced acute lung injury enhanced ferroptosis in vitro in mouse lung epithelial-2 cells, and ferroptosis was modulated after the enhancement of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in Nrf2−/− mice. iASPP mediated its protective effects against acute lung injury through the Nrf2/HIF-1/TF signaling pathway. Ferroptosis contributes to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI, and iASPP treatment inhibits ferroptosis in part via Nrf2. These findings indicate the therapeutic potential of iASPP for treating ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI."
"BRCA1/2 genetic testing to use PARP inhibitor for breast cancer has a possibility of the “secondary finding” among the younger nonaffected family members of the patient, which turns them into at-risk for hereditary breast cancer. Proper understanding of the background of the hereditary cancer is now required for appropriate acceptance of the risk. Therefore, we investigated the level of knowledge and attitudes of younger women on hereditary breast cancer in Japan. Study subject was Japanese university women between 20 and 30 years of age, without medical history of breast cancer. We conducted the anonymous self-answering questionnaire to them. We received responses from 353 women. The levels of knowledge, awareness, and interest were relatively high. Women with a family history of breast cancer were less likely to undergo testing than women without (92.8% vs. 74.5%, p < 0.001). The rates of positive response toward risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) was significantly high for medical majors compared with that for other majors (RRM: medical 71.6% vs. science 54.5% vs. humanities 53.8%, p = 0.008, RRSO: 35.4% vs. 36.3% vs. 48.4%, p = 0.027). Approximately half of respondents answered that they would hesitate to get married (45.3%) or to have children (55.4%), if they were a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier. The results may help to establish the methods for supporting the decision-making for reproduction of younger women who are unexpectedly labeled as being at-risk for HBOC."
"Chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are multifactorial inter-related diseases with strong genetic contributions. Better elucidation of the heritability of psoriatic disease subsets is important for identifying novel genes, risk stratification and potential clinical applications. In this study, we used two mixed-effect modelling methodologies to assess the additive contribution of common single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies to estimate the heritability of cutaneous psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis. We found that cutaneous psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis both exhibit considerable heritability, with a greater contribution coming from cutaneous psoriasis."
"Inter-individual differences in T helper (Th) cell responses affect susceptibility to infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. To identify factors contributing to these response differences, here we analyze in vitro differentiated Th1 cells from 16 inbred mouse strains. Haplotype-based computational genetic analysis indicates that the p53 family protein, p73, affects Th1 differentiation. In cells differentiated under Th1 conditions in vitro, p73 negatively regulates IFNγ production. p73 binds within, or upstream of, and modulates the expression of Th1 differentiation-related genes such as Ifng and Il12rb2. Furthermore, in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalitis, p73-deficient mice have increased IFNγ production and less disease severity, whereas in an adoptive transfer model of inflammatory bowel disease, transfer of p73-deficient naïve CD4+ T cells increases Th1 responses and augments disease severity. Our results thus identify p73 as a negative regulator of the Th1 immune response, suggesting that p73 dysregulation may contribute to susceptibility to autoimmune disease."
"Autism has become a pressing healthcare challenge. The instruments used to aid diagnosis are time and labor expensive and require trained clinicians to administer, leading to long wait times for at-risk children. We present a multi-modular, machine learning-based assessment of autism comprising three complementary modules for a unified outcome of diagnostic-grade reliability: A 4-minute, parent-report questionnaire delivered via a mobile app, a list of key behaviors identified from 2-minute, semi-structured home videos of children, and a 2-minute questionnaire presented to the clinician at the time of clinical assessment. We demonstrate the assessment reliability in a blinded, multi-site clinical study on children 18-72 months of age (n = 375) in the United States. It outperforms baseline screeners administered to children by 0.35 (90% CI: 0.26 to 0.43) in AUC and 0.69 (90% CI: 0.58 to 0.81) in specificity when operating at 90% sensitivity. Compared to the baseline screeners evaluated on children less than 48 months of age, our assessment outperforms the most accurate by 0.18 (90% CI: 0.08 to 0.29 at 90%) in AUC and 0.30 (90% CI: 0.11 to 0.50) in specificity when operating at 90% sensitivity."
"ObjectiveTo compare the prognostic accuracy of six neonatal illness severity scores (CRIB, CRIB II, SNAP, SNAP II, SNAP-PE, and SNAP-PE II), birthweight (BW), and gestational age (GA) for predicting pre-discharge mortality among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (<1500 g) and very preterm infants (<32 weeks’ gestational age).Study designPubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus were the data sources searched for studies published before January 2019. Data were extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models and reported as AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsOf 1659 screened studies, 24 met inclusion criteria. CRIB was the most discriminate for predicting pre-discharge mortality [AUC 0.88 (0.86–0.90)]. GA was the least discriminate [AUC 0.76 (0.72–0.80)].ConclusionsAlthough the original CRIB score was the most accurate predictor of pre-discharge mortality, significant heterogeneity between studies lowers confidence in this pooled estimate. A more precise illness severity score to predict pre-discharge mortality is still needed."
"Phenotypic variability in prion diseases, such as scrapie, is associated to the existence of prion strains, which are different pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) conformations with distinct pathobiological properties. To faithfully study scrapie strain variability in natural sheep isolates, transgenic mice expressing sheep cellular prion protein (PrPC) are used. In this study, we used two of such models to bioassay 20 scrapie isolates from the Spain-France-Andorra transboundary territory. Animals were intracerebrally inoculated and survival periods, proteinase K-resistant PrP (PrPres) banding patterns, lesion profiles and PrPSc distribution were studied. Inocula showed a remarkable homogeneity on banding patterns, all of them but one showing 19-kDa PrPres. However, a number of isolates caused accumulation of 21-kDa PrPres in TgShp XI. A different subgroup of isolates caused long survival periods and presence of 21-kDa PrPres in Tg338 mice. It seemed that one major 19-kDa prion isoform and two distinct 21-kDa variants coexisted in source inocula, and that they could be separated by bioassay in each transgenic model. The reason why each model favours a specific component of the mixture is unknown, although PrPC expression level may play a role. Our results indicate that coinfection with more than one substrain is more frequent than infection with a single component."
"BackgroundG protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are well-characterized regulators of a plethora of physiological functions among them the modulation of adipogenesis and adipocyte function. The class of Adhesion GPCR (aGPCR) and their role in adipose tissue, however, is poorly studied. With respect to the demand for novel targets in obesity treatment, we present a comprehensive study on the expression and function of this enigmatic GPCR class during adipogenesis and in mature adipocytes.MethodsThe expression of all aGPCR representatives was determined by reanalyzing RNA-Seq data and by performing qPCR in different mouse and human adipose tissues under low- and high-fat conditions. The impact of aGPCR expression on adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation was studied by siRNA-mediated knockdown of all expressed members of this receptor class. The biological characteristics and function of mature adipocytes lacking selected aGPCR were analyzed by mass spectrometry and biochemical methods (lipolysis, glucose uptake, adiponectin secretion).ResultsMore than ten aGPCR are significantly expressed in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues and several aGPCR are differentially regulated under high-caloric conditions in human and mouse. Receptor knockdown of six receptors resulted in an impaired adipogenesis indicating their expression is essential for proper adipogenesis. The altered lipid composition was studied in more detail for two representatives, ADGRG2/GPR64 and ADGRG6/GPR126. While GPR126 is mainly involved in adipocyte differentiation, GPR64 has an additional role in mature adipocytes by regulating metabolic processes.ConclusionsAdhesion GPCR are significantly involved in qualitative and quantitative adipocyte lipid accumulation and can control lipolysis. Factors driving adipocyte formation and function are governed by signaling pathways induced by aGPCR yielding these receptors potential targets for treating obesity."
"BackgroundSeveral reports have shown the role of glycosylation in pancreatic cancer (PC), but a global systematic screening of specific glycosyltransferases (glycoTs) in its progression remains unknown.MethodsWe demonstrate a rigorous top-down approach using TCGA-based RNA-Seq analysis, multi-step validation using RT-qPCR, immunoblots and immunohistochemistry. We identified six unique glycoTs (B3GNT3, B4GALNT3, FUT3, FUT6, GCNT3 and MGAT3) in PC pathogenesis and studied their function using CRISPR/Cas9-based KD systems.ResultsSerial metastatic in vitro models using T3M4 and HPAF/CD18, generated in house, exhibited decreases in B3GNT3, FUT3 and GCNT3 expression on increasing metastatic potential. Immunohistochemistry identified clinical significance for GCNT3, B4GALNT3 and MGAT3 in PC. Furthermore, the effects of B3GNT3, FUT3, GCNT3 and MGAT3 were shown on proliferation, migration, EMT and stem cell markers in CD18 cell line. Talniflumate, GCNT3 inhibitor, reduced colony formation and migration in T3M4 and CD18 cells. Moreover, we found that loss of GCNT3 suppresses PC progression and metastasis by downregulating cell cycle genes and β-catenin/MUC4 axis. For GCNT3, proteomics revealed downregulation of MUC5AC, MUC1, MUC5B including many other proteins.ConclusionsCollectively, we demonstrate a critical role of O- and N-linked glycoTs in PC progression and delineate the mechanism encompassing the role of GCNT3 in PC."
"Drug-disease association is an important piece of information which participates in all stages of drug repositioning. Although the number of drug-disease associations identified by high-throughput technologies is increasing, the experimental methods are time consuming and expensive. As supplement to them, many computational methods have been developed for an accurate in silico prediction for new drug-disease associations. In this work, we present a novel computational model combining sparse auto-encoder and rotation forest (SAEROF) to predict drug-disease association. Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, drug structure similarity and disease semantic similarity were extracted for exploring the association among drugs and diseases. On this basis, a rotation forest classifier based on sparse auto-encoder is proposed to predict the association between drugs and diseases. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we used it to implement 10-fold cross validation on two golden standard datasets, Fdataset and Cdataset. As a result, the proposed model achieved AUCs (Area Under the ROC Curve) of Fdataset and Cdataset are 0.9092 and 0.9323, respectively. For performance evaluation, we compared SAEROF with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier and some existing computational models. Three human diseases (Obesity, Stomach Neoplasms and Lung Neoplasms) were explored in case studies. As a result, more than half of the top 20 drugs predicted were successfully confirmed by the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database(CTD database). This model is a feasible and effective method to predict drug-disease correlation, and its performance is significantly improved compared with existing methods."
"Genetic factors and the immunologic response have been suggested to determine the susceptibility against the infection and the outcome of Chagas disease. In the present study, we analysed three IL17A genetic variants (rs4711998, rs8193036 and rs2275913) regarding the predisposition to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and the development of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) in different Latin American populations. A total of 2,967 individuals from Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, were included in this study. The individuals were classified as seronegative and seropositive for T. cruzi antigens, and this last group were divided into asymptomatic and CCC. For T. cruzi infection susceptibility, the IL17A rs2275913*A showed a significant association in a fixed-effect meta-analysis after a Bonferroni correction (P = 0.016, OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.06–1.41). No evidence of association was detected when comparing CCC vs. asymptomatic patients. However, when CCC were compared with seronegative individuals, it showed a nominal association in the meta-analysis (P = 0.040, OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.01–1.45). For the IL17A rs4711998 and rs8193036, no association was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that IL17A rs2275913 plays an important role in the susceptibility to T. cruzi infection and could also be implicated in the development of chronic cardiomyopathy in the studied Latin American population."
"Comprehending the mechanisms behind the impact of vaccine regimens on immunity is critical for improving vaccines. Indeed, the time-interval between immunizations may influence B and T cells, as well as innate responses. We compared two vaccine schedules using cynomolgus macaques immunized with an attenuated vaccinia virus. Two subcutaneous injections 2 weeks apart led to an impaired secondary antibody response and similar innate myeloid responses to both immunizations. In contrast, a delayed boost (2 months) improved the quality of the antibody response and involved more activated/mature innate cells, induced late after the prime and responding to the recall. The magnitude and quality of the secondary antibody response correlated with the abundance of these neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells that were modified phenotypically and enriched prior to revaccination at 2 months, but not 2 weeks. These late phenotypic modifications were associated with an enhanced ex vivo cytokine production (including IL-12/23 and IL-1β) by PBMCs short after the second immunization, linking phenotype and functions. This integrated analysis reveals a deep impact of the timing between immunizations, and highlights the importance of early but also late innate responses involving phenotypical changes, in shaping humoral immunity."
"Diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a complicated, time-consuming process which is particularly challenging in older individuals. One of the most widely used behavioral diagnostic tools is the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Previous work using machine learning techniques suggested that ASD detection in children can be achieved with substantially fewer items than the original ADOS. Here, we expand on this work with a specific focus on adolescents and adults as assessed with the ADOS Module 4. We used a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) to examine whether ASD detection can be improved by identifying a subset of behavioral features from the ADOS Module 4 in a routine clinical sample of N = 673 high-functioning adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 385) and individuals with suspected ASD but other best-estimate or no psychiatric diagnoses (n = 288). We identified reduced subsets of 5 behavioral features for the whole sample as well as age subgroups (adolescents vs. adults) that showed good specificity and sensitivity and reached performance close to that of the existing ADOS algorithm and the full ADOS, with no significant differences in overall performance. These results may help to improve the complicated diagnostic process of ASD by encouraging future efforts to develop novel diagnostic instruments for ASD detection based on the identified constructs as well as aiding clinicians in the difficult question of differential diagnosis."
"We aimed to examine the association of weight gain during adulthood with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus, from inception to June 2019. Prospective cohort studies investigating the association of weight gain during adulthood with the risk of CVD were included. The relative risks (RRs) were calculated by using random-effect models. Twenty-three prospective cohort studies with 1,093,337 participants were included. The RRs for a 5-kg increment in body weight were 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.19; I2 = 80%, n = 11) for CVD mortality, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.32; I2 = 90%, n = 8) for coronary heart disease (CHD), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.12; I2 = 0%, n = 3) for stroke, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.25; I2 = 0%, n = 2) for myocardial infarction and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.23; I2 = 80%, n = 2) for heart failure. A dose–response analysis demonstrated that the risk of CVD mortality was unchanged with weight gain of 0–5 kg, and then increased sharply and linearly (P for nonlinearity < 0.001). The analysis of CHD indicated a sharp increase in risk from baseline up to weight gain equal to 25 kg (P for nonlinearity = 0.12). Adult weight gain may be associated with a higher risk of CVD. Measuring weight gain during adulthood may be better than static, cross-sectional assessment of weight because it considers trend over time, and thus, can be used as a supplementary approach to predict CVD."
"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) participates in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that intravascular cell-derived PDI plays an important role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases, including thrombosis and vascular inflammation. Recent studies with PDI conditional knockout mice have advanced our understanding of the function of cell-specific PDI in disease processes. Furthermore, the identification and development of novel small-molecule PDI inhibitors has led into a new era of PDI research that transitioned from the bench to bedside. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on the regulatory role of PDI in cardiovascular disease."
"Literature on earthquake impact on hospital admissions is lacking, particularly in low-resource settings. Our aim was to study the pattern of admissions before and after the 2015 earthquake in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. We used routine hospital data from 9,596 admissions, and defined four periods: pre-earthquake (pre-EQ), acute (EQ1), post-acute (EQ2), and post-earthquake (post-EQ). We compared length of hospital stay (LOS) across the study periods using negative binomial regressions. We used logistic regressions to study changes in probability of admission for diagnostic categories, and Generalized Additive Models to model the difference in number of admissions compared to pre-EQ baseline. LOS was longer in EQ1 than during pre-EQ, in particular for injury-related admissions. In EQ1, the odds of injury admissions increased, while they decreased for the majority of other diagnoses, with the odds of pregnancy-related admissions remaining low until post-EQ. The number of admissions dropped in EQ1 and EQ2, and returned to pre-EQ trends in post-EQ, accumulating 381 admissions lost (CI: 206–556). Our findings suggest that hospital disaster plans must not only foresee injury management after earthquakes, but also ensure accessibility, in particular for pregnant women, and promote a quick return to normality to prevent additional negative health outcomes."
"The exact relationships between group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and Th2 cells in type 2 pathology, as well as the mechanisms that restrain the responses of these cells, remain poorly defined. Here we examined the roles of ILC2s and Th2 cells in type 2 lung pathology in vivo using germline and conditional Relb-deficient mice. We found that mice with germline deletion of Relb (Relb−/−) spontaneously developed prominent type 2 pathology in the lung, which contrasted sharply with mice with T-cell-specific Relb deletion (Relbf/fCd4-Cre), which were healthy with no observed autoimmune pathology. We also found that in contrast to wild-type B6 mice, Relb-deficient mice showed markedly expanded ILC2s but not ILC1s or ILC3s. Moreover, adoptive transfer of naive CD4+ T cells into Rag1−/−Relb−/− hosts induced prominent type 2 lung pathology, which was inhibited by depletion of ILC2s. Mechanistically, we showed that Relb deletion led to enhanced expression of Bcl11b, a key transcription factor for ILC2s. We concluded that RelB plays a critical role in restraining ILC2s, primarily by suppressing Bcl11b activity, and consequently inhibits type 2 lung pathology in vivo."
"Computer vision has greatly advanced recently. Since AlexNet was first introduced, many modified deep learning architectures have been developed and they are still evolving. However, there are few studies comparing these architectures in the field of ophthalmology. This study compared the performance of various state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures for detecting the optic nerve head and vertical cup-to-disc ratio in fundus images. Three different architectures were compared: YOLO V3, ResNet, and DenseNet. We compared various aspects of performance, which were not confined to the accuracy of detection but included, as well, the processing time, diagnostic performance, effect of the graphic processing unit (GPU), and image resolution. In general, as the input image resolution increased, the classification accuracy, localization error, and diagnostic performance all improved, but the optimal architecture differed depending on the resolution. The processing time was significantly accelerated with GPU assistance; even at the high resolution of 832 × 832, it was approximately 170 ms, which was at least 26 times slower without GPU. The choice of architecture may depend on the researcher’s purpose when balancing between speed and accuracy. This study provides a guideline to determine deep learning architecture, optimal image resolution, and the appropriate hardware."
"Taurine that conjugates with bile acid (BA) and mitochondrial-tRNA (mt-tRNA) is a conditional essential amino acid in humans, similarly to cats. To better understand the influence of acquired depletion of taurine on BA metabolism, the profiling of BAs and its intermediates, BA metabolism-enzyme expression, and taurine modified mt-tRNAs were evaluated in the taurine deficient diet-supplemented cats. In the taurine depleted cats, taurine-conjugated bile acids in bile and taurine-modified mt-tRNA in liver were significantly decreased, whereas unconjugated BA in serum was markedly increased. Impaired bile acid metabolism in the liver was induced accompanied with the decreases of mitochondrial cholesterol 27-hydroxylase expression and mitochondrial activity. Consequently, total bile acid concentration in bile was significantly decreased by the low activity of mitochondrial bile acid synthesis. These results implied that the insufficient dietary taurine intake causes impaired bile acid metabolism, and in turn, a risk for the various diseases similar to the mitochondrial diseases would be enhanced."
"Drug resistance remains a serious issue of clinical importance and is a consequence of cancer stemness. In this study, we showed that the level of Aldolase A (ALDOA) expression is significantly associated with the IC50 value of chemotherapy drugs in lung cancer. Our data revealed that ALDOA overexpression resulted in a significant increase of lung tumor spheres. The use of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) resulted in the identification of POU5F1 (Oct4) as the leading transcription factor of ALDOA. We observed high expression of ALDOA, Oct4 and stemness markers in collected spheroid cells. DUSP4 and TRAF4 were confirmed as major downstream targets of the ALDOA-Oct4 axis. Knockdown of these molecules significantly decreased the stemness ability of cells. In addition, we investigated whether miR-145 targets the 3′-UTR of Oct4 and is regulated by ALDOA due to the involvement of ALDOA in glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we constructed several mutant forms of ALDOA that disrupted its enzymatic activity and showed that they still induced significant in vitro sphere formation and in vivo tumorigenicity. These results demonstrated that ALDOA-mediated spheroid formation is independent of its enzymatic activity. In the clinical component, we also showed that the combination of ALDOA and TRAF4 or DUSP4 is positively correlated with poor overall survival in a xenograft model and cancer patients through immunohistochemical analyses. The results of our study revealed novel functional roles of ALDOA in inducing cancer stemness via the inhibition of miR-145 expression and the activation of Oct4 transcription. These findings offer new therapeutic strategies for modulation of lung cancer stemness to enhance chemotherapeutic responses in lung cancer patients."
"Schizotypal disorder lies in the schizophrenia spectrum and is widely studied in adult populations. Schizotypal disorder in children (SDc) is less well described. This study examined brain morphological and functional connectivity abnormalities in SDc (12 SDc and 9 typically developing children), focusing on the default mode and executive control brain networks. Results indicated that SDc is associated with reduced grey matter volume (GMV) in superior and medial frontal gyri, and increased resting-state functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, compared to typically developing children (cluster-level FWE-corrected p < 0.05). The brain structure abnormality (GMV in left superior frontal gyrus) was correlated with clinical symptoms in SDc (r = −0.66, p = 0.026) and functional connectivity abnormality was correlated with extra-dimensional shifting impairments in all participants (r = 0.62, p = 0.011), suggesting their contribution to the underlying mechanisms of clinical presentation. These preliminary results motivate further work to characterize the neural basis of SDc and its significance as a risk factor for later psychosis."
"Designing non-natural antibody formats is a practical method for developing highly functional next-generation antibody drugs, particularly for improving the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatments. One approach is constructing bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). We previously reported a functional humanized bispecific diabody (bsDb) that targeted epidermal growth factor receptor and CD3 (hEx3-Db). We enhanced its cytotoxicity by constructing an Fc fusion protein and rearranging order of the V domain. In this study, we created an additional functional bsAb, by integrating the molecular formats of bsAb and high-affinity mutants previously isolated by phage display in the form of Fv. Introducing the high-affinity mutations into bsDbs successfully increased their affinities and enhanced their cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. However, there were some limitations to affinity maturation of bsDb by integrating high-affinity Fv mutants, particularly in Fc-fused bsDb with intrinsic high affinity, because of their bivalency. The tetramers fractionated from the bsDb mutant exhibited the highest in vitro growth inhibition among the small bsAbs and was comparable to the in vivo anti-tumor effects of Fc-fused bsDbs. This molecule shows cost-efficient bacterial production and high therapeutic potential."
"The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the host defense against viral and microbial infection. Exosomes constitute a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be released by almost all cell types. Owing to their capacity to shield the payload from degradation and to evade recognition and subsequent removal by the immune system, exosomes efficiently transport functional components to recipient cells. Accumulating evidence has recently shown that exosomes derived from tumor cells, host cells and even bacteria and parasites mediate the communication between the invader and innate immune cells and thus play an irreplaceable function in the dissemination of pathogens and donor cell-derived molecules, modulating the innate immune responses of the host. In this review, we describe the current understanding of EVs (mainly focusing on exosomes) and summarize and discuss their crucial roles in determining innate immune responses. Additionally, we discuss the potential of using exosomes as biomarkers and cancer vaccines in diagnostic and therapeutic applications."
"BackgroundTo investigate the effect of frailty on short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).MethodsWithin the National Inpatient Sample database, we identified 91,618 RP patients treated between 2008 and 2015. The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator was applied, and we examined the rates of frailty over time, as well as its effect on overall complications, major complications, nonhome-based discharge, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges (THCs). Time trends and multivariable logistic, Poisson and linear regression models were applied.ResultsOverall, 12,185 (13.3%) patients were frail. Rates of frail patients increased over time (from 10.3 to 18.2%; p < 0.001). Frail patients had higher rates of overall complications (16.6 vs. 8.6%), major complications (4.9 vs. 2.6%), nonhome-based discharge (5.9 vs. 5%), longer LOS (2 vs. 1), and higher THCs ($37,186 vs. $35,241) (all p < 0.001). Moreover, frailty was an independent predictor of overall complications (OR: 1.95), major complications (OR: 1.76), nonhome-based discharge (OR: 1.20), longer LOS (RR: 1.19), and higher THCs (RR: $3160) (all p < 0.001). Of frail patients, 10,418 (85.5%) neither exhibited body mass index ≥ 30 nor Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 2.ConclusionsOn average, every seventh RP patient is frail and that proportion is on the rise. Frail individuals are at higher risk of adverse short-term postoperative outcomes, that cannot be predicted by other risk factors, such as obesity or comorbidities."
"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease with variable clinical presentations. Large animal models are useful to help dissect molecular mechanisms, determine relevant biomarkers, and develop effective therapeutics. Here, we studied a NF1 minipig model (NF1+/ex42del) for the first 12 months of life to evaluate phenotype development, track disease progression, and provide a comparison to human subjects. Through systematic evaluation, we have shown that compared to littermate controls, the NF1 model develops phenotypic characteristics of human NF1: [1] café-au-lait macules, [2] axillary/inguinal freckling, [3] shortened stature, [4] tibial bone curvature, and [5] neurofibroma. At 4 months, full body computed tomography imaging detected significantly smaller long bones in NF1+/ex42del minipigs compared to controls, indicative of shorter stature. We found quantitative evidence of tibial bowing in a subpopulation of NF1 minipigs. By 8 months, an NF1+/ex42del boar developed a large diffuse shoulder neurofibroma, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging, which subsequently grew in size and depth as the animal aged up to 20 months. The NF1+/ex42del minipig model progressively demonstrates signature attributes that parallel clinical manifestations seen in humans and provides a viable tool for future translational NF1 research."
"Microglial activation is associated with glaucoma. In the model of unilateral laser-induced ocular hypertension (OHT), the time point at which the inflammatory process peaks remains unknown. Different time points (1, 3, 5, 8, and 15 d) were compared to analyze signs of microglial activation both in OHT and contralateral eyes. In both eyes, microglial activation was detected in all retinal layers at all time points analyzed, including: i) increase in the cell number in the outer segment photoreceptor layer and plexiform layers (only in OHT eyes) from 3 d onward; ii) increase in soma size from 1 d onward; iii) retraction of the processes from 1 d in OHT eyes and 3 d in contralateral eyes; iv) increase in the area of the retina occupied by Iba-1+ cells in the nerve fiber layer/ganglion cell layer from 1 d onward; v) increase in the number of vertical processes from 1 d in contralateral eyes and 3 d in OHT eyes. In OHT eyes at 24 h and 15 d, most Iba-1+ cells were P2RY12+ and were down-regulated at 3 and 5 d. In both eyes, microglial activation was stronger at 3 and 5 d (inflammation peaked in this model). These time points could be useful to identify factors implicated in the inflammatory process."
"Although fibrosis depicts a reparative mechanism, maladaptation of the heart due to excessive production of extracellular matrix accelerates cardiac dysfunction. The anthraquinone Rhein was examined for its anti-fibrotic potency to mitigate cardiac fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Primary human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts were subjected to hypoxia and characterized with proteomics, transcriptomics and cell functional techniques. Knowledge based analyses of the omics data revealed a modulation of fibrosis-associated pathways and cell cycle due to Rhein administration during hypoxia, whereas p53 and p21 were identified as upstream regulators involved in the manifestation of cardiac fibroblast phenotypes. Mechanistically, Rhein acts inhibitory on HDAC classes I/II as enzymatic inhibitor. Rhein-mediated cellular effects were linked to the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent protein stabilization of p53 under normoxic but not hypoxic conditions. Functionally, Rhein inhibited collagen contraction, indicating anti-fibrotic property in cardiac remodeling. This was accompanied by increased abundance of SMAD7, but not SMAD2/3, and consistently SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2. In conclusion, this study identifies Rhein as a novel potent direct HDAC inhibitor that may contribute to the treatment of cardiac fibrosis as anti-fibrotic agent. As readily available drug with approved safety, Rhein constitutes a promising potential therapeutic approach in the supplemental and protective intervention of cardiac fibrosis."
"Approximately 50% of women experience at least one bone fracture postmenopause. Current screening approaches target anti-fracture interventions to women aged >60 years who satisfy clinical risk and bone mineral density criteria for osteoporosis. Intervention is only recommended in 7–25% of those women screened currently, well short of the 50% who experience fractures. Large screening trials have not shown clinically significant decreases in the total fracture numbers. By contrast, six large clinical trials of anti-resorptive therapies (for example, bisphosphonates) have demonstrated substantial decreases in the number of fractures in women not identified as being at high risk of fracture. This finding suggests that broader use of generic bisphosphonates in women selected by age or fracture risk would result in a reduction in total fracture numbers, a strategy likely to be cost-effective. The utility of the current bone density definition of osteoporosis, which neither corresponds with who suffers fractures nor defines who should be treated, requires reappraisal."
"Study designNon-randomized within-subject experimental study.ObjectiveTo determine whether the addition of the 1 cm heel lift to the footwear improves the walking ability of the persons with Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES).SettingDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Christian Medical College, India.MethodsFourteen people with bilateral plantar flexor weakness following traumatic CES (mean age 43.7 years) were recruited for the study. Their walking speed, stride length, cadence, and time taken to complete Timed Up and Go (TUG) were measured using footwear with back straps. Then, the 1 cm heel lift was attached to the sole of the footwear. After sufficient practice, all the parameters were reassessed to find out the effectiveness of the heel lift.ResultsWith the 1 cm heel lift, the participants walked 0.13 m/s (95% CI, 0.08–0.17) faster than their regular footwear. They were able to complete the TUG test 2.6 s (95% CI, 1.4–3.7) earlier than before. There was an increase of 5.2 in. in stride length (95% CI, 2.9–9) and an eight steps increase in cadence (95% CI, 4.9–11.3) observed after the heel lift.ConclusionsThis pilot study has demonstrated that addition of 1 cm heel may be effective in improving the walking performance of persons with Cauda Equina Syndrome. Future studies should investigate the kinetic and kinematic changes of this modification using a randomized controlled trial study design."
"Clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) is time-consuming and invasive. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and accuracy of EZSCAN in detecting impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in Chinese population, and explore a diagnosis formula based on an autonomic test using EZSCAN measurement and anthropometric data. Eligible subjects (n = 1547) had the following data collected: those of anthropometric and EZSCAN measurements and biochemical tests including FPG, OGTT, HbA1c, and serum lipid tests. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm method was used to derive a diagnostic formula. In this study, 452 and 263 subjects were diagnosed with T2DM and IGT, respectively, while 832 had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The sensitivity rates for the formula were 77.2% for T2DM and 80.4% for IGT. The diagnostic formula was found to correlate strongly with EZSCAN values. The diagnostic formula based on autonomic test and anthropometric data appears to be a convenient and accurate routine screening option in the Chinese population."
"Aim of this review is to summarize and evaluate the current literature addressing the synchronous combined surgical treatment approach for co-existent post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. Severity of stress urinary incontinence is the basic element that defines which option of combined surgery will be offered to a patient. So, for cases of severe erectile dysfunction and severe stress urinary incontinence (>4 pads/day) the only available option is synchronous inflatable penile prosthesis plus artificial urinary sphincter dual implantation. When severe erectile dysfunction coexist with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence synchronous inflatable penile prosthesis plus male sling or ProAct (Uromedica, Plymouth, MN, USA) device are the current available treatment options. Finally, when severe erectile dysfunction along with mild stress urinary incontinence and with or without climacturia are present, a new surgical technique of simultaneous inflatable penile prosthesis plus urethral mini-sling, named “Andrianne mini-jupette”, implantation has been recently proposed. Synchronous combined surgery for post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence seems to offer similar efficacy and safety results compared with two-stage implantation but in a more cost- and time effective approach. Thus, synchronous surgery, in the hands of experienced prosthetic surgeons, could be potentially a valuable alternative for the management of co-existent post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, in order to acquire robust scientific data further prospective comparative studies on larger numbers of patients are surely needed."
"Echocardiographic measurements are used in critical care to evaluate volume status and cardiac performance. Mean systemic filling pressure and global heart efficiency measures intravascular volume and global heart function. This prospective study conducted in fifty haemodynamically stabilized, mechanically ventilated patients investigated relationships between static echocardiographic variables and estimates of global heart efficiency and mean systemic filling pressure. Results of univariate analysis demonstrated weak correlations between left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.27, p = 0.04), right atrial volume index (rho = 0.31, p = 0.03) and analogue mean systemic filling pressure; moderate correlations between left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.31, p = 0.03), left ventricular global longitudinal strain (r = 0.36, p = 0.04), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (rho = 0.37, p = 0.01) and global heart efficiency. No significant correlations were demonstrated by multiple regression. Mean systemic filling pressure calculated with cardiac output measured by echocardiography demonstrated good agreement and correlation with invasive techniques (bias 0.52 ± 1.7 mmHg, limits of agreement −2.9 to 3.9 mmHg, r = 0.9, p < 0.001). Static echocardiographic variables did not reliably reflect the volume state as defined by estimates of mean systemic filling pressure. The agreement between static echocardiographic variables of cardiac performance and global heart efficiency lacked robustness. Echocardiographic measurements of cardiac output can be reliably used in calculation of mean systemic filling pressure."
"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Methods of identifying BE patients at high risk for progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or EAC are needed to improve outcomes and identify who will benefit most from intensive surveillance or ablative therapy. Clinical predictors of BE progression to HGD or EAC are poorly understood, with multiple contradictory studies. We performed a retrospective study which included 460 patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital who underwent at least 2 upper endoscopies 6 months apart showing biopsy-documented BE between 1992 and 2013. Patients with EAC or HGD at the initial endoscopy were excluded. Demographic, clinicopathological, and endoscopic data were collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses with time to progression to HGD and EAC were performed. Among 460 patients included in the study, 132 BE patients developed HGD and 62 developed EAC. Significant EAC risk factors included age, abdominal obesity, caffeine intake, and the presence of HGD. Risk factors for HGD or EAC included age, caffeine intake, and low-grade dysplasia while colonic adenomas trended towards significance. Notably, a history of statin or SSRI usage reduced the risk of EAC or HGD by 49% or 61%, respectively. Our study validated several known and identified several novel risk factors, including a history of colonic adenomas or caffeine usage. Low-grade dysplasia was a risk factor for progression but various endoscopic characteristics were not, suggesting that screening strategies should focus on histology instead. We identified SSRIs as a new potentially chemoprotective medication."
"Loss-of-function mutations in the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 2a1 gene (SLCO2A1), which encodes a prostaglandin (PG) transporter, have been identified as causes of chronic nonspecific multiple ulcers in the small intestine; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been revealed. We, therefore, evaluated the effects of systemic knockout of Slco2a1 (Slco2a1−/−) and conditional knockout in intestinal epithelial cells (Slco2a1ΔIEC) and macrophages (Slco2a1ΔMP) in mice with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced acute colitis. Slco2a−/− mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than wild-type (WT) mice, but did not spontaneously develop enteritis or colitis. The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeats containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was more strongly upregulated in colon tissues of Slco2a−/− mice administered DSS and in macrophages isolated from Slco2a1−/− mice than in the WT counterparts. Slco2a1ΔMP, but not Slco2a1ΔIEC mice, were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than WT mice, partly phenocopying Slco2a−/− mice. Concentrations of PGE2 in colon tissues and macrophages from Slco2a1−/− mice were significantly higher than those of WT mice. Blockade of inflammasome activation suppressed the exacerbation of colitis. These results indicated that Slco2a1-deficiency increases the PGE2 concentration, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages, thus exacerbating intestinal inflammation."
"ObjectivesHospital closures promote latent factors putting patients at risk for medical errors. Our goal was to maintain safe patient care in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) by preventing any increase in neonatal mortality or hospital-based complications prior to hospital closure.MethodsInterventions included expanding TeamSTEPPS huddles and Leadership WalkRoundsTM. Measurements of safety domains were conducted using the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. A run chart tracked neonatal mortality. We compared hospital-based complications for all neonatal admissions in 2019 with our own past outcomes and Vermont Oxford Network (VON) benchmarks.ResultsTeamwork climate scores increased from an average score of 24.6–28.3 (maximum score 30, P < 0.05, CI 6.7–0.9). Quarterly neonatal mortality and neonatal outcomes did not worsen. The frequency of transfer did not increase.ConclusionsA strong teamwork climate with resilient leadership may mitigate safety concerns under calamitous circumstances."
"Endometriosis shares similarities with several autoimmune diseases. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C genotype is associated with several human autoimmune diseases. HLA-C is a ligand of killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) and is an essential regulator of natural killer cell activity, which is associated with endometriosis progression. Polymorphisms in HLA-C and KIR affect the activity of NK cells and susceptibility to several diseases. Therefore, we attempted to investigate an association between HLA-C genotype and KIR polymorphism and the occurrence of endometriosis. We tested the association of certain KIR and HLA-C combinations and the development of endometriosis by characterizing both KIR and HLA-C genes in 147 women with endometriosis and 117 controls. The HLA-C genotypes and KIR polymorphisms were analyzed via DNA-based method for higher-resolution genotyping. We found that the occurrence of HLA-C*03:03*01 was increased in endometriosis than in control groups. Analysis of various KIR haplotypes revealed differences between the endometriosis and control cohorts. The number of KIR centromeric A/A haplotypes was increased in the endometriosis group than controls. Moreover, the endometriosis cohort was characterized by reduced number of KIR2DS2-positive individuals in the Han Chinese population. Our current findings suggest that the KIR and HLA-C genotypes are associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis."
"Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are aerosols with an aerodynamic diameter of 0.1 µm (100 nm) or less. There is a growing concern in the public health community about the contribution of UFPs to human health. Despite their modest mass and size, they dominate in terms of the number of particles in the ambient air. A particular concern about UFPs is their ability to reach the most distal lung regions (alveoli) and circumvent primary airway defenses. Moreover, UFPs have a high surface area and a capacity to adsorb a substantial amount of toxic organic compounds. Harmful systemic health effects of PM10 or PM2.5 are often attributable to the UFP fraction. In this review, we examine the physicochemical characteristics of UFPs to enable a better understanding of the effects of these particles on human health. The characteristics of UFPs from diesel combustion will be discussed in the greatest detail because road vehicles are the primary source of UFP emissions in urban pollution hotspots. Finally, we will elaborate on the role of UFPs on global climate change, since the adverse effects of UFPs on meteorological processes and the hydrological cycle may even be more harmful to human health than their direct toxic effects."
"BackgroundLiver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Every type of tumours including liver cancer contains cancer stem cells (CSCs). To date, the molecular mechanism regulating the development of liver CSCs remains unknown.MethodsIn this study, we tried to generate a new model of liver CSCs by converting mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line Huh7 cells conditioned medium (CM). miPSCs treated with CM were injected into the liver of BALB/c nude mice. The developed tumours were then excised and analysed.ResultsThe primary cultured cells from the malignant tumour possessed self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential and tumorigenicity in vivo, which were found rich in liver cancer-associated markers as well as CSC markers.ConclusionsWe established a model of liver CSCs converting from miPS and showed different stages of stemness during conversion process. Our CSC model will be important to assess the molecular mechanisms necessary to develop liver CSCs and could help in defeating liver cancer."
"Background/objectiveThe recognized association between male hypogonadism and obesity has multifactorial implications on adipose tissue (AT) physiology. The fat solubility of testosterone (T) suggests a sequestration process in fat depots, leading to reduced circulating levels of T in obesity. Several evidence suggest that steroids play a two-sided inhibitory role on adipogenesis by locally decreasing lipid accumulation and by stimulating lipolysis. The current study investigates T trafficking and activity in dysfunctional AT.Subjects/methodsSamples of subcutaneous AT (SAT) were obtained from explants from lipoaspirate plastic surgery in six obese and six normal weight male patients. Experimental procedures on both SAT explants and insulin-resistant (IR) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were performed, including real-time PCR and mass-spectrometry quantification.ResultsA significant deregulation of gene responsiveness to androgens in IR cells and obese SAT was observed (all p < 0.05), together with reduced T release after adrenergic stimulation (−10% compared with −55% in lean SAT, p = 0.021). Higher concentrations of intracellular T and estradiol in obese SAT were also observed (2.4 vs. 1.3 ng/g, p = 0.013 and 0.075 vs. 0.22 ng/g, p = 0.004, respectively). Testosterone accumulation resulted in even lower expression in androgen-responsive genes involved in lipolytic and anti-adipogenic pathways from both in vitro and ex vivo experiments.ConclusionsThese results suggest an altered response of dysfunctional fat cells to testosterone stimulation, which normally favors lipolysis and induces an anti-adipogenic effect. The considerable reduction of lipolytic T release after adrenergic stimulation in obese SAT contributes to AT dysfunction, in a feedforward loop further reducing T levels in obese hypogonadal males."
"Excessive phosphorus intake adversely affects bone and mineral metabolism. Estrogen is one of the factors affecting fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a phosphorus-regulating hormone. However, the interaction between excess phosphorus and estrogen status has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the involvement of estrogen in the effects of high phosphorus intake on bone metabolism and ectopic calcification in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The interaction between high phosphorus diet and OVX was not observed in bone mineral density and aortic calcium. In contrast, high phosphorus intake markedly increased renal calcium concentration in sham rats, whereas the effect was attenuated in OVX rats, which was reversed by a selective estrogen-receptor modulator treatment. A strong positive correlation between renal calcium and serum FGF23 was observed. In addition, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1: a predominant receptor of FGF23) inhibitor treatment partially decreased renal calcium concentrations in rats with high phosphorus intake. In conclusion, the effect of high phosphorus intake on bone metabolism and aortic calcification did not depend on the estrogen status; in contrast, high phosphorus intake synergistically induced nephrocalcinosis in the presence of estrogenic action on the bone. Furthermore, FGF23 was involved in the nephrocalcinosis induced by high phosphorus intake partially through FGFR1 signaling."
"BackgroundReproductive factors and hormone use in postmenopausal women have been hypothesised to affect the risk of developing lung cancer, but the epidemiological evidence is inconsistent.MethodsUsing the Korean National Health Insurance System database, we identified 4,775,398 postmenopausal women older than 40 years who had undergone both cardiovascular health- and cancer screening between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014. Information about reproductive factors was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. The risk of lung cancer was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 16,556 women (15,223 non-smokers) were diagnosed with lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer was not significantly influenced by early menarche age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.03 for menarche ≥18 vs. ≤14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98–1.09) or late age at menopause (aHR 1.02 for menopause ≥55 vs. <40; 95% CI, 0.91–1.14). Furthermore, the number of children, duration of breastfeeding and use of hormone replacement therapy were not associated with the risk of lung cancer.ConclusionsNo statistically significant association was found between reproductive factors and the risk of lung cancer in postmenopausal Korean women."
"While cancer stem cells are well established in certain hematologic and solid malignancies, their existence in T cell lymphoma is unclear and the origin of disease is not fully understood. To examine the existence of lymphoma stem cells, we utilized a mouse model of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Established NPM-ALK+ lymphomas contained heterogeneous cell populations ranging from mature T cells to undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, CD4−/CD8− double negative (DN) lymphoma cells aberrantly expressed the T cell receptor α/β chain. Serial transplantation of sorted CD4/CD8 and DN lymphoma subpopulations identified lymphoma stem cells within the DN3/DN4 T cell population, whereas all other subpopulations failed to establish serial lymphomas. Moreover, transplanted lymphoma DN3/DN4 T cells were able to differentiate and gave rise to mature lymphoma T cells. Gene expression analyses unmasked stem-cell-like transcriptional regulation of the identified lymphoma stem cell population. Furthermore, these lymphoma stem cells are characterized by low CD30 expression levels, which might contribute to limited long-term therapeutic success in patients treated with anti-CD30-targeted therapies. In summary, our results highlight the existence of a lymphoma stem cell population in a NPM-ALK-driven CD30+ mouse model, thereby giving the opportunity to test innovative treatment strategies developed to eradicate the origin of disease."
"This study aimed to validate the long-term prognostic value of a new clinical-genomic model, Distant Genetic Model-Clinical Variable Model 6 (DGM-CM6), developed in Asia as a prognostic panel for all subtypes of breast cancer. We included 752 operable stage I–III breast cancer patients representing all subtypes treated from 2005 to 2014 as the validation cohort. The median follow-up was 95.8 months. The low- and high-risk patients classified by DGM-CM6 (RI-DR) had significant differences in 10-year distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) (94.1% vs. 85.0%, P < 0.0001) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (90.0% vs. 80.5%, P = 0.0003). External validation using EMTAB-365 dataset showed similar observation (P < 0.0001). DGM-CM6 was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis with hazard ratios of 3.1 (1.6–6.0) for RFS (P = 0.0009) and 3.8 (1.6–9.0) for DRFI (P = 0.0028). Comparing the C-index of DGM-CM6 and PAM50-ROR scores, the former performed better than the latter in predicting long-term DRFI and RFS, especially in N0, ER/PR-positive, and HER2-negative patients."
"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major cause of morbidity mortality in critically ill hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. We assessed aGVHD trajectories in 191 allogeneic-HSCT recipients (age 42 (27–46)) admitted to our ICU between 2005 and 2015. aGVHD affected 130 (68%) patients (including 90% who underwent steroid therapy at a dose of 2 (2–2) mg/kg) and was graded 3 or 4 in 31% of the patients. Trajectories of aGVHD were clustered in four groups: (1) no aGVHD, (2) controlled aGVHD, (3) uncontrolled aGVHD (active, stable, or worsening), and (4) newly diagnosed and untreated aGVHD. Patients with controlled aGVHD and those admitted at the onset of aGVHD had similar survival than patients who never experienced aGVHD. By multivariable analysis, the dynamic assessment of aGVHD was independently associated with 90-day mortality, in addition to the admission to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury or acute liver failure, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment score at admission. In conclusion, these findings suggest that GVHD cannot be assessed as a binary variable and at a single time point. Patients in whom GVHD is not uncontrolled with corticosteroids should have the same goals of ICU care than patients without GVHD."
"Glucose metabolism is remodeled in cancer, but the global pattern of cancer-specific metabolic changes remains unclear. Here we show, using the comprehensive measurement of metabolic enzymes by large-scale targeted proteomics, that the metabolism both carbon and nitrogen is altered during the malignant progression of cancer. The fate of glutamine nitrogen is shifted from the anaplerotic pathway into the TCA cycle to nucleotide biosynthesis, with this shift being controlled by glutaminase (GLS1) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT). Interventions to reduce the PPAT/GLS1 ratio suppresses tumor growth of many types of cancer. A meta-analysis reveals that PPAT shows the strongest correlation with malignancy among all metabolic enzymes, in particular in neuroendocrine cancer including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). PPAT depletion suppresses the growth of SCLC lines. A shift in glutamine fate may thus be required for malignant progression of cancer, with modulation of nitrogen metabolism being a potential approach to SCLC treatment."
"Women have a lower incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) than men, however, they have a higher incidence of right-sided colon cancer (RCC). This is of concern as patients with RCC have the poorest clinical outcomes among all CRC patients. Aberrant metabolism is a known hallmark and therapeutic target for cancer. We propose that metabolic subphenotypes exist between CRCs due to intertumoral molecular and genomic variation, and differences in environmental milieu of the colon which vary between the sexes. Metabolomics analysis of patient colon tumors (n = 197) and normal tissues (n = 39) revealed sex-specific metabolic subphenotypes dependent on anatomic location. Tumors from women with RCC were nutrient-deplete, showing enhanced energy production to fuel asparagine synthesis and amino acid uptake. The clinical importance of our findings were further investigated in an independent data set from The Cancer Genomic Atlas, and demonstrated that high asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression correlated with poorer survival for women. This is the first study to show a unique, nutrient-deplete metabolic subphenotype in women with RCC, with implications for tumor progression and outcomes in CRC patients."
"Aims and objectivesTo describe a study protocol of a randomised control trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness, in reducing dental anxiety, of an acclimatising nitrous oxide sedation (N2O) session prior to actual dental treatment with N2O.Materials and methodsA single-centre investigator-blinded parallel-group RCT conducted in a postgraduate dental hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Anxious children requiring N2O (aged 5–15 years) will be randomly assigned to; a study group: children who will have a preparatory N2O trial experience or; a control group: children who will only have N2O explained to them. Treatment with N2O for both groups will start at the second visit. The following outcomes will be recorded: completion of dental treatment, anxiety scores at baseline and after treatment (using the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale faces), behaviour of the child (using Frankl Rating Behaviour Scale) and the acquisition of real-time physiological anxiety-related parameters (using E4® electronic wrist devices).ResultsThe data will be analysed statistically.DiscussionThere is a paucity of research regarding dental N2O acclimatising appointments. This RCT will supplement existing literature.ConclusionsThis RCT will report whether prior acclimatising of a child to N2O sedation is effective, or not, in improving dental treatment behaviour."
"In the era of precision oncology, liquid biopsy techniques, especially the use of plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis, represent a paradigm shift in the use of genomic biomarkers with considerable implications for clinical practice. Compared with tissue-based tumour DNA analysis, plasma ctDNA is more convenient to test, more readily accessible, faster to obtain and less invasive, minimizing procedure-related risks and offering the opportunity to perform serial monitoring. Additionally, genomic profiles of ctDNA have been shown to reflect tumour heterogeneity, which has important implications for the identification of resistant clones and selection of targeted therapy well before clinical and radiographic changes occur. Moreover, plasma ctDNA testing can also be applied to cancer screening, risk stratification and quantification of minimal residual disease. These features provide an unprecedented opportunity for early treatment of patients, improving the chances of treatment success."
"Septic patients can develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is characterized by systemic blood coagulation and an increased risk of life-threatening haemorrhage. Although antithrombin (AT) and thrombomodulin (TM) combination anticoagulant therapy is frequently used to treat septic patients with DIC in Japan, its effectiveness in improving patient outcomes remains unclear. In this large-scale multicentre retrospective study of adult septic patients with DIC treated at Japanese hospitals between February 2010 and March 2016, we compared in-hospital mortality between AT monotherapy and AT + TM combination therapy. We performed logistic regression analysis with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable and anticoagulant therapy as the main independent variable of interest. Covariates included patient demographics, disease severity, and body surface area. The AT group and AT + TM group comprised 1,017 patients from 352 hospitals and 1,205 patients from 349 hospitals, respectively. AT + TM combination therapy was not significantly associated with lower mortality when compared with AT monotherapy (odds ratio: 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.78–1.21; P = 0.81). AT + TM combination therapy was also not superior to AT monotherapy in reducing mechanical ventilation or hospitalization durations. Despite its widespread use for treating sepsis with DIC, AT + TM combination therapy is not more effective in improving prognoses than the simpler AT monotherapy."
"The opportunistic pathogen Malassezia pachydermatis causes bloodstream infections in preterm infants or individuals with immunodeficiency disorders and has been associated with a broad spectrum of diseases in animals such as seborrheic dermatitis, external otitis and fungemia. The current approaches to treat these infections are failing as a consequence of their adverse effects, changes in susceptibility and antifungal resistance. Thus, the identification of novel therapeutic targets against M. pachydermatis infections are highly relevant. Here, Gene Essentiality Analysis and Flux Variability Analysis was applied to a previously reported M. pachydermatis metabolic network to identify enzymes that, when absent, negatively affect biomass production. Three novel therapeutic targets (i.e., homoserine dehydrogenase (MpHSD), homocitrate synthase (MpHCS) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (MpSDH)) were identified that are absent in humans. Notably, L-lysine was shown to be an inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of MpHCS and MpSDH at concentrations of 1 mM and 75 mM, respectively, while L-threonine (1 mM) inhibited MpHSD. Interestingly, L- lysine was also shown to inhibit M. pachydermatis growth during in vitro assays with reference strains and canine isolates, while it had a negligible cytotoxic activity on HEKa cells. Together, our findings form the bases for the development of novel treatments against M. pachydermatis infections."
"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn)-rich aggregates propagate in neuronal networks and compromise cellular homeostasis leading to synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease. Aggregated aSyn spread follows a conserved spatio-temporal pattern that is not solely dependent on connectivity. Hence, the differential tropism of aSyn-rich aggregates to distinct brain regions, or their ability to amplify within those regions, must contribute to this process. To better understand what underlies aSyn-rich aggregates distribution within the brain, we generated primary neuronal cultures from various brain regions of wild-type mice and mice expressing a reduced level of aSyn, and exposed them to fibrillar aSyn. We then assessed exogenous fibrillar aSyn uptake, endogenous aSyn seeding, and endogenous aSyn physiological expression levels. Despite a similar uptake of exogenous fibrils by neuronal cells from distinct brain regions, the seeded aggregation of endogenous aSyn differed greatly from one neuronal population to another. The different susceptibility of neuronal populations was linked to their aSyn expression level. Our data establish that endogenous aSyn expression level plays a key role in fibrillar aSyn prion-like seeding, supporting that endogenous aSyn expression level participates in selective regional brain vulnerability."
"Baby-led approaches to complementary feeding promote intake of family foods rather than infant specific foods, from the start of the complementary feeding period, which advocates suggest should be less expensive. However, this has never been formally examined. We recently completed a 2-year randomised controlled trial comparing baby-led (BLISS) and traditional spoon-feeding (Control) approaches to complementary feeding in 206 infants. Perceived expense was assessed at infant 7, 8, 9 and 12 months of age. The actual cost of intake (food offered, consumed and left over) was calculated from 3-day weighed diet records at 7 and 12 months of age. BLISS was perceived as less expensive than traditional feeding (P = 0.002), but comparisons of actual costs showed only small differences in total daily cost for food offered (NZ$0.20 and NZ$0.10 at 7 and 12 months, respectively), consumed (NZ$0.30, NZ$0.20) or left over (NZ$0.10, NZ$0.20). Baby-led approaches are not cheaper for families than traditional spoon-feeding."
"No imaging modality can be used to evaluate Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD). We retrospectively reviewed hepatic gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) characteristics of patients within 1 year post-Fontan procedure, and we evaluated the association between hepatic imaging abnormalities and clinical parameters, including follow-up cardiac catheterization and laboratory test findings. The EOB-MR images were graded, based on the extent of the decreased enhancement, as “normal” (Grade 1), “segmental” (Grade 2), “regional” (Grade 3), and “diffuse” (Grade 4). We enrolled 37 patients (mean age, 3.5 ± 1.0 years): 9 patients had Grade 1 or 2; 14 patients, Grade 3; and 14 patients, Grade 4. EOB-MRI revealed characteristic reticular or mosaic patterns of diminished enhancement (i.e. “frog spawn” appearance). Ultrasonography did not detect diminished enhancement or “frog spawn” appearance. A trend existed toward increased grade severity in imaging with increased central venous pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels. Noninvasive EOB-MRI revealed the characteristic pattern of diminished enhancement, which was correlated with certain clinical parameters indicative of Fontan physiology and liver dysfunction. Early-stage FALD may occur soon after the Fontan procedure and is associated with increased pressure in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins."
"Magee Equations™ are multivariable models that can estimate oncotype DX® Recurrence Score, and Magee Equation 3 has been shown to have chemopredictive value in the neoadjuvant setting as a standalone test. The current study tests the accuracy of Magee Decision Algorithm™ using a large in-house database. According to the algorithm, if all Magee Equation scores are <18, or 18–25 with a mitosis score of 1, then oncotype testing is not required as the actual oncotype recurrence score is expected to be ≤25 (labeled “do not send”). If all Magee Equation scores are 31 or higher, then also oncotype testing is not required as the actual score is expected to be >25 (also “do not send”). All other cases could be considered for testing (labeled “send”). Of the 2196 ER+, HER2-negative cases sent for oncotype testing, 1538 (70%) were classified as “do not send” and 658 (30%) as “send”. The classification accuracy in the “do not send” group was 95.1%. Of the 75 (4.9%) discordant cases (expected score ≤25 by decision algorithm but the actual oncotype score >25), 26 received endocrine therapy alone. None of these 26 patients experienced distant recurrence (average follow-up of 73 months). The Magee Decision Algorithm accurately identifies cases that will not benefit from oncotype testing. Such cases constitute ~70% of the routine clinical oncotype requests, an estimated saving of $300,000 per 100 test requests. The occasional discordant cases (expected ≤25, but actual oncotype score >25) appears to have an excellent outcome on endocrine therapy alone."
"While the effects of an antenatal dietary intervention for women with obesity or overweight on pregnancy and newborn health have been extensively studied, the longer-term effects into childhood are unknown. We followed children born to women who participated in the LIMIT randomised trial, where pregnant women were randomised to an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention or standard antenatal care. Our aim was to assess the effect of the intervention, on child outcomes at 3–5 years of age on children whose mothers provided consent. We assessed 1418 (Lifestyle Advice n = 727; Standard Care n = 691) (66.9%) of the 2121 eligible children. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of child BMI z-score >85th centile for children born to women in the Lifestyle Advice Group, compared with the Standard Care group (Lifestyle Advice 444 (41.73%) versus Standard Care 417 (39.51%); adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.05; 95% confidence intervals 0.93–1.19; p = 0.42). There were no significant effects on measures of child growth, adiposity, neurodevelopment, or dietary intake. There is no evidence that an antenatal dietary intervention altered child growth and adiposity at age 3–5 years. This cohort of children remains at high risk of obesity, and warrants ongoing follow-up."
"Ultrafine particles (PM0.1), which are present in the air in large numbers, pose a health risk. They generally enter the body through the lungs but translocate to essentially all organs. Compared to fine particles (PM2.5), they cause more pulmonary inflammation and are retained longer in the lung. Their toxicity is increased with smaller size, larger surface area, adsorbed surface material, and the physical characteristics of the particles. Exposure to PM0.1 induces cough and worsens asthma. Metal fume fever is a systemic disease of lung inflammation most likely caused by PM0.1. The disease is manifested by systemic symptoms hours after exposure to metal fumes, usually through welding. PM0.1 cause systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation changes that predispose individuals to ischemic cardiovascular disease and hypertension. PM0.1 are also linked to diabetes and cancer. PM0.1 can travel up the olfactory nerves to the brain and cause cerebral and autonomic dysfunction. Moreover, in utero exposure increases the risk of low birthweight. Although exposure is commonly attributed to traffic exhaust, monitored students in Ghana showed the highest exposures in a home near a trash burning site, in a bedroom with burning coils employed to abate mosquitos, in a home of an adult smoker, and in home kitchens during domestic cooking. The high point-source production and rapid redistribution make incidental exposure common, confound general population studies and are compounded by the lack of global standards and national reporting. The potential for PM0.1 to cause harm to health is great, but their precise role in many illnesses is still unknown and calls for more research."
"We aimed to identify blood gene expression patterns associated to psychopathological trajectories retrieved from a large community, focusing on the emergence and remission of general psychiatric symptoms. Hundred and three individuals from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study (BHRCS) for mental disorders were classified in four groups according to Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) total score at the baseline (w0) and after 3 years (w1): low–high (L–H) (N = 27), high–low (H–L) (N = 12), high–high (H–H) (N = 34) and low–low (L–L) groups (N = 30). Blood gene expression profile was measured using Illumina HT-12 Beadchips, and paired analyses comparing w0 and w1 were performed for each group. Results: 98 transcripts were differentially expressed comparing w0 and w1 in the L-H, 33 in the H–L, 177 in the H–H and 273 in the L–L. Of these, 66 transcripts were differentially expressed exclusively in the L–H; and 6 only in the H–L. Cross-Lagged Panel Models analyses revealed that RPRD2 gene expression at w1 might be influenced by the CBCL score at w0. Moreover, COX5B, SEC62, and NDUFA2 were validated with another technique and were also differentially regulated in postmortem brain of subjects with mental disorders, indicating that they might be important not only to specific disorders, but also to general psychopathology and symptoms trajectories. Whereas genes related to metabolic pathways seem to be associated with the emergence of psychiatric symptoms, mitochondrial inner membrane genes might be important over the course of normal development. These results suggest that changes in gene expression can be detected in blood in different psychopathological trajectories."
"BackgroundRecent evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) in obesity may develop independently in different organs, representing different etiologies toward type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IR in the liver and IR in skeletal muscle are associated with distinct metabolic profiles.MethodsThis study includes baseline data from 634 adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) (≤65 years; 63% women) without diabetes of the European Diogenes Study. Hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI) and muscle insulin sensitivity index (MISI), were derived from a five-point OGTT. At baseline 17 serum metabolites were identified and quantified by nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. Linear mixed model analyses (adjusting for center, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio) were used to associate HIRI and MISI with these metabolites. In an independent sample of 540 participants without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2; 40–65 years; 46% women) of the Maastricht Study, an observational prospective population-based cohort study, 11 plasma metabolites and a seven-point OGTT were available for validation.ResultsBoth HIRI and MISI were associated with higher levels of valine, isoleucine, oxo-isovaleric acid, alanine, lactate, and triglycerides, and lower levels of glycine (all p < 0.05). HIRI was also associated with higher levels of leucine, hydroxyisobutyrate, tyrosine, proline, creatine, and n-acetyl and lower levels of acetoacetate and 3-OH-butyrate (all p < 0.05). Except for valine, these results were replicated for all available metabolites in the Maastricht Study.ConclusionsIn persons with obesity without diabetes, both liver and muscle IR show a circulating metabolic profile of elevated (branched-chain) amino acids, lactate, and triglycerides, and lower glycine levels, but only liver IR associates with lower ketone body levels and elevated ketogenic amino acids in circulation, suggestive of decreased ketogenesis. This knowledge might enhance developments of more targeted tissue-specific interventions to prevent progression to more severe disease stages."
"Given that 5–25% of the adult population report child sexual abuse (CSA), most clinicians will care for victims. Data regarding CSA experiences among medical students are limited and the association of medical students’ own history of CSA with relevant perceptions has not been previously examined. The aim of this study was to assess CSA perceptions and exposure of medical students, while exploring their associations. For this purpose, a link was created and made available on a site accessed solely by the Athens medical school undergraduates from February 20 to March 20 2019, comprising a 12-item questionnaire to assess the knowledge and past experience of CSA. This was based on a larger published questionnaire, which was translated and adapted. The questionnaire was then transcripted online, and after pilot testing, was disseminated using the Google documents® platform. Out of 261 responses, CSA was reported by 48 participants (18%), of which 39 were women. Thirty five reported contact CSA. Thirty seven victims (77%) reported previous disclosure of the event, but 18 of them were not protected post disclosure. CSA victims were less likely to agree with the perception that most perpetrators are mentally ill or disabled (p = 0.043), and more likely to strongly disagree with the statement that reputable families are protected from sexual abuse (p = 0.019). In agreement with existing data in general populations globally, about one in five medical students had exposure to CSA. In addition, a potential association of their own experiences with shaping perceptions regarding the identity of CSA perpetrators and affected families for medical students is highlighted."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of major depression and its relevant biological phenotypes have been extensively conducted in large samples, and transcriptome-wide analyses in the tissues of brain regions relevant to pathogenesis of depression, e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), have also been widely performed recently. Integrating these multi-omics data will enable unveiling of depression risk genes and even underlying pathological mechanisms. Here, we employ summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS) approaches to integrate multi-omics data from GWAS, DLPFC expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses and enhancer-promoter physical link studies to prioritize high-confidence risk genes for depression, followed by independent replications across distinct populations. These integrative analyses identify multiple high-confidence depression risk genes, and numerous lines of evidence supporting pivotal roles of the netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene in this illness across different populations. Our subsequent explorative analyses further suggest that DCC significantly predicts neuroticism, well-being spectrum, cognitive function and putamen structure in general populations. Gene expression correlation and pathway analyses in DLPFC further show that DCC potentially participates in the biological processes and pathways underlying synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, circadian entrainment, as well as learning and long-term potentiation. These results are in agreement with the recent findings of this gene in neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders, and we thus further confirm that DCC is an important susceptibility gene for depression, and might be a potential target for new antidepressants."
"The Golgi apparatus plays a central role in the intracellular transport of macromolecules. However, molecular mechanisms of Golgi-mediated lipid transport remain poorly understood. Here, we show that genetic inactivation of the Golgi-resident protein GRASP55 in mice reduces whole-body fat mass via impaired intestinal fat absorption and evokes resistance to high-fat diet induced body weight gain. Mechanistic analyses reveal that GRASP55 participates in the Golgi-mediated lipid droplet (LD) targeting of some LD-associated lipases, such as ATGL and MGL, which is required for sustained lipid supply for chylomicron assembly and secretion. Consequently, GRASP55 deficiency leads to reduced chylomicron secretion and abnormally large LD formation in intestinal epithelial cells upon exogenous lipid challenge. Notably, deletion of dGrasp in Drosophila causes similar defects of lipid accumulation in the midgut. These results highlight the importance of the Golgi complex in cellular lipid regulation, which is evolutionary conserved, and uncover potential therapeutic targets for obesity-associated diseases."
"Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC)-related modular calcium-binding protein-2 (SMOC2), a secreted matricellular protein, is reported to be involved in various processes related to cancer progression such as regulating the cell cycle, angiogenesis, and invasion. However, its expression and prognostic significance in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) remains unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the expression profile of SMOC2 and its prognostic value in a large cohort of PTCs. Real time-PCR analysis with fresh-frozen tissues showed that SMOC2 mRNA expression in PTCs was substantially lower than the expression in matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues, consistent with the results from thyroid cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that SMOC2 was normally present in thyroid follicular epithelial cells and the expression level was maintained in nodular hyperplasia. However, SMOC2 expression was significantly lower in lymphocytic thyroiditis and follicular tumors including follicular adenomas and carcinomas. In particular, 38% of PTCs exhibited a complete loss of SMOC2 expression, which was associated with the presence of BRAF (V600E) mutation. Moreover, SMOC2 further declined during lymph node metastasis in PTCs. DNA methylation chip analysis revealed one hypermethylated CpG site in the promoter region of SMOC2 gene, suggesting an epigenetic regulation of SMOC2 in PTCs. Remarkably SMOC2 positivity was associated with improved recurrence-free survival along with female sex, tumor size, and the N stage. However, SMOC2 was not identified as an independent prognostic marker in multivariate analyses. Taken together, SMOC2 expression is significantly down-regulated in PTCs and SMOC2 positivity is closely associated with better clinical outcomes, suggesting that SMOC2 can be a prognostic marker in PTC patients."
"To suggest candidate genes involved in periodontitis, we combined gene expression data of periodontal biopsies from Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse lines, with previous reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) in mouse and with human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) associated with periodontitis. Periodontal samples from two susceptible, two resistant and two lines that showed bone formation after periodontal infection were collected during infection and naïve status. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed in a case-control and case-only design. After infection, eleven protein-coding genes were significantly stronger expressed in resistant CC lines compared to susceptible ones. Of these, the most upregulated genes were MMP20 (P = 0.001), RSPO4 (P = 0.032), CALB1 (P = 1.06×10−4), and AMTN (P = 0.05). In addition, human orthologous of candidate genes were tested for their association in a case-controls samples of aggressive (AgP) and chronic (CP) periodontitis (5,095 cases, 9,908 controls). In this analysis, variants at two loci, TTLL11/PTGS1 (rs9695213, P = 5.77×10−5) and RNASE2 (rs2771342, P = 2.84×10−5) suggested association with both AgP and CP. In the association analysis with AgP only, the most significant associations were located at the HLA loci HLA-DQH1 (rs9271850, P = 2.52×10−14) and HLA-DPA1 (rs17214512, P = 5.14×10−5). This study demonstrates the utility of the CC RIL populations as a suitable model to investigate the mechanism of periodontal disease."
"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are essential for rhythmic activity in the heart and brain, and mutations in HCN channels are linked to heart arrhythmia and epilepsy. HCN channels belong to the family of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels. However, why HCN channels are activated by hyperpolarization whereas Kv channels are activated by depolarization is not clear. Here we reverse the voltage dependence of HCN channels by mutating only two residues located at the interface between the voltage sensor and the pore domain such that the channels now open upon depolarization instead of hyperpolarization. Our data indicate that what determines whether HCN channels open by hyperpolarizations or depolarizations are small differences in the energies of the closed and open states, due to different interactions between the voltage sensor and the pore in the different channels."
"Smoking is partly attributed to alterations of reward processing. However, findings on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie smoking-related and smoking-unrelated reward processing in smokers have been inconsistent. Neuroimaging experiments that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reported brain responses to smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers and healthy controls as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space were identified by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to December 2018. Three meta-analyses were performed using random-effect nonparametric statistics with Seed-based d Mapping software, with brain activity contrast from individual studies as the input. The striatum showed higher activation in response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues in 816 smokers from 28 studies and lower activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in 275 smokers compared with 271 healthy control individuals from 13 studies. The relative reactivity of the putamen to smoking-related cues increased in 108 smokers compared with 107 healthy controls from seven studies. Meta-regression showed that smokers with a greater severity of nicotine dependence exhibited less engagement of the striatum in response to both smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues. The present results reveal the disruption of reward system function in smokers and provide new insights into diverging theories of addiction. With the escalation of nicotine dependence, nicotine appears to exert dynamic effects on reward processing, based on incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory."
"BackgroundThe aim of the study was to determine the human leucocyte antigen class-I (HLA-I), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of microsatellite instability-high gastric cancer.MethodsThe HLA-I expression type was determined by immunohistochemistry of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and β2-microglobulin in the centre of the tumour (CT) and in the invasive margin (IM) of samples from 293 patients (total loss vs. preserved type). PD-L1 expression and TIL density was examined immunohistochemically. HLA-I genotyping was also performed.ResultsThe expression loss of the HLA-I molecules was significantly associated with low TIL density. According to survival analyses, the HLA-I expression type and PD-L1 positivity were not independent prognostic factors. The TIL density had no prognostic implication when survival analysis was performed for the whole patient group; however, high CD8+ TIL infiltration was significantly associated with good prognosis in only HLA-I-preserved-type/PD-L1-positive group (p = 0.034). The homozygosity of the HLA-I allele was more frequently observed in the total loss type group.ConclusionsWe confirmed differential prognostic implication of CD8+ TILs according to the HLA-I and PD-L1 expression. Determination of the HLA-I expression could be helpful to select patients who would benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy."
"The relationship between ambient particulate matter exposure and health has been well established. Ultrafine particles (UFP) with a diameter of 100 nm or less are known to increase pulmonary disease risk. Biological factors in dust containing UFP can cause severe inflammatory reactions. Pulmonary diseases develop primarily as a result of chronic inflammation caused by immune dysfunction. Thus, this review focuses on the adverse pulmonary effects of biological UFP, principally lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs), in indoor dust and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases. The impact of LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation is based primarily on the amount of inhaled LPS. When relatively low levels of LPS are inhaled, a cascade of immune responses leads to Th2 cell induction, and IL-5 and IL-13 released by Th2 cells contributes to asthma development. Conversely, exposure to high levels of LPS induces a Th17 cell response, leading to increased production of IL-17, which is associated with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer incidence. Responses to bacterial EV exposure can similarly be broadly divided based on whether one of two mechanisms, either intracellular or extracellular, is activated, which depends on the type of the parent cell. Extracellular bacteria-derived EVs can cause neutrophilic inflammation via Th17 cell induction, which is associated with asthma, emphysema, COPD, and lung cancer. On the other hand, intracellular bacteria-derived EVs lead to mononuclear inflammation via Th1 cell induction, which increases the risk of emphysema. In conclusion, future measures should focus on the overall reduction of LPS sources in addition to the improvement of the balance of inhaled bacterial EVs in the indoor environment to minimize pulmonary disease risk."
"BackgroundPrevious studies have reported that high-dose supplementation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may reduce the risk of metabolic diseases, but there is limited evidence of an effect on body fat. We examined the associations of erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs with body fat and fat distribution in a general population consuming a normal diet.MethodsThis community-based cross-sectional study included 3075 Chinese (68% women, 40–75 years) recruited between 2008 and 2013. We collected general information and measured anthropometric indices; erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs (including α-C18:3, C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6) by gas-chromatography, and fat mass (FM) and %FM at the total body (TB), android (A) and gynoid (G) regions by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).ResultsBoth minimally and maximally adjusted models showed dose-dependent inverse associations of total and individual levels of erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs (except C20:5 n-3[EPA]) with adiposity indices. In the full model, the mean differences between quartiles 4 and 1 of total n-3 PUFAs were −1.60% (BMI), −4.06% (TB FM), −5.38% (A FM), −2.05% (G FM), −2.05% (TB %FM), −3.39% (A %FM) and −2.50% (% A/G); the ORs (95% CI) of %FM-derived obesity (≥25% for men, ≥35% for women) for the highest (vs. lowest) quartile were 0.70 (0.57, 0.86) for total n-3 PUFAs and 0.71 (0.58, 0.87), 0.96(0.78, 1.18), 0.82(0.67, 1.00), 0.66 (0.54, 0.81) for α-C18:3/C20:5/C22:5/C22:6 n-3, respectively. The favourable associations were more pronounced for the DXA-derived FM indices, measurements at the android region and for C22:6 n-3. No significant associations between C20:5 n-3 and the adiposity indices were observed.ConclusionsHigher levels of circulating n-3 PUFAs were dose-dependently associated with better profiles of body fat and fat distribution, particularly in the abdominal regions in this population."
"Aim of this review is to summarize and evaluate the current literature on the pathophysiology, prevalence, sociosexual impact, and potential treatment options of climacturia. Climacturia, defined as orgasm-associated urinary incontinence and characterized by great prevalence variability, ranging between 15.7 and 93% was, so far, a relatively neglected post-radical prostatectomy functional side-effect. Recent studies have shown that it can significantly impact the quality of life of couples after prostate cancer treatment. A knowledge gap characterizes the pathophysiologic pathways while treatment is based on empirically chosen treatment options (condom use, presexual intercourse urination) or on therapeutic modalities proposed by low-quality studies (pelvic floor muscle training, penile applied devices). Evidence regarding efficacy of surgical techniques (artificial urinary sphincter, male sling, or dual implantation of penile prosthesis with a sling) for climacturia treatment are limited but with an increasing trend of relevant published data in the last 5 years. The mini-jupette sling plus inflatable penile prosthesis placement is a promising surgical technique that has been studied in a multi-institutional cohort with encouraging results regarding climacturia, erectile dysfunction, and mild-incontinence control. However, future studies with longer follow-up and larger sample sizes are certainly needed to confirm the long-term safety and benefits of this intervention."
"The liver has the ability to maintain its total size by adjusting the size of the individual liver lobes differently in response to regeneration- and atrophy-stimuli. Portal vein ligation (PVL) drives the ligated lobe to undergo atrophy whereas partial hepatectomy (PHx) drives the total remnant liver to regenerate. We hypothesize that the size of the PVL-lobe is dependent on the balance between the extent of PVL and the extent of PHx inducing a complex interplay between hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy. Lewis-rats were subjected to either 20%PVL + 70%PHx or 70%PVL + 20%PHx. Control groups consisted of 20%PVL and 70%PVL. Liver lobe weight, BrdU-proliferation-index, proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-mRNA-expression level, apoptotic density and autophagy-related-proteins were investigated. The PVL-liver lobe adjusted its weight differently, increasing by 40% after 20%PVL + 70%PHx, but decreasing by 25% after 70%PVL + 20%PHx. Additional resection induced a low, but substantial size-dependent hepatocyte proliferation rate (maximal 6.3% and 3.6% vs. 0.3% and significantly suppressed apoptotic density in the deportalized-liver-lobe (3 and 14 cells/mm2 comparing with above 26 cells/mm2, p < 0.01). Autophagy was more activated in PVL-liver lobe after simultaneous PHx than after PVL only. In summary, atrophy of the PVL-liver lobe after simultaneous PHx was counteracted by promoting hepatocyte proliferation, inducing autophagy and suppressing apoptosis in a PHx-extent-dependent manner."
"The production and consumption of livestock products are under examination on environmental, human health and animal welfare grounds. However, a wealth of evidence suggests that the livestock sector has complex interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with both the problem and solution spaces for livestock interventions varying depending on the context. To circumvent the uncertainty associated with incomplete or conflicting evidence for making policy recommendations, we suggest a sharper focus on local solutions to global targets, as well as due attention to cross-scale feedbacks that occur between them. Our analysis offers a lens that focuses on balancing both the costs and benefits of the livestock sector, and can be used to define better livestock policy that steers the planet towards a more sustainable and food-secure future."
"Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide that is expressed by many surface epithelial cells, but its relevance to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced gastritis is unknown. Here, we found that gastric ADM expression was elevated in gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected patients and mice. In H. pylori-infected human gastric mucosa, ADM expression was positively correlated with the degree of gastritis; accordingly, blockade of ADM resulted in decreased inflammation within the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected mice. During H. pylori infection, ADM production was promoted via PI3K–AKT signaling pathway activation by gastric epithelial cells in a cagA-dependent manner, and resulted in increased inflammation within the gastric mucosa. This inflammation was characterized by the increased IFN-γ-producing T cells, whose differentiation was induced via the phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 by ADM derived from gastric epithelial cells. ADM also induced macrophages to produce IL-12, which promoted the IFN-γ-producing T-cell responses, thereby contributing to the development of H. pylori-associated gastritis. Accordingly, blockade of IFN-γ or knockout of IFN-γ decreased inflammation within the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected mice. This study identifies a novel regulatory network involving H. pylori, gastric epithelial cells, ADM, macrophages, T cells, and IFN-γ, which collectively exert a pro-inflammatory effect within the gastric microenvironment."
"Cancer is a disease caused by a process that drives the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells. The late diagnosis of cancer has a negative impact on the health care system due to high treatment cost and decreased chances of favorable prognosis. Here, we aimed to identify orofacial conditions that can serve as potential risk markers for cancers by performing a phenome-wide scan (PheWAS). From a pool of 6,100 individuals, both genetic and epidemiological data of 1,671 individuals were selected: 350 because they were previously diagnosed with cancer and 1,321 to match to those individuals that had cancer, based on age, sex, and ethnicity serving as a comparison group. Results of this study showed that when analyzing the individuals affected by cancer separately, tooth loss/edentulism is associated with SNPs in AXIN2 (rs11867417 p = 0.02 and rs2240308 p = 0.02), and leukoplakia of oral mucosa is associated with both AXIN2 (rs2240308 p = 0.03) and RHEB (rs2374261 p = 0.03). These phenotypes did not show the same trends in patients that were not diagnosed with cancer, allowing for the conclusion that these phenotypes are unique to cases with higher cancer risk."
"Hypertension (HTN) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity among Iranians. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of pre-HTN and HTN and some of its related factors in south of Iran. This cross-sectional survey was conducted on the data of the Persian cohort study in Kherameh. The participants consisted of 10,663 people aged 40–70 years. HTN was defined as either systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) ≥140/90 mmHg or taking medications. Pre-HTN was defined as SBP = 120–139 mmHg and/or DBP = 80–89 mmHg. The logistic regression method was used to identify the factors associated with pre-HTN and HTN. The age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of pre-HTN was 19.66% (95% CI: 19.45–19.86%) and 18.59% (95% CI: 18.36–18.83%) in males and females, respectively. Also, the ASPR of HTN was 21.44 (95% CI: 21.22–21.65%) in males and 33.53% (95% CI: 33.22–33.85%) in females. Male gender, old age, being unemployed, low education level, high body mass index (BMI), no smoking, diabetes, cerebro-cardiovascular disease, suffering from another chronic disease, family history of CVD, and negative family history of cancer and other chronic diseases were independently associated with pre-HTN (p < 0.05). All variables, except for gender, smoking, and family history of cancer, were significantly associated with HTN. Drug abuse was also correlated to HTN (p < 0.05). This study revealed the increased prevalence of HTN in rural and urban areas. Therefore, the health system needs to develop strategies to raise the accessibility of screening and diagnostic services."
"BackgroundThe role of different subtypes of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is still poorly defined. This study aimed to assess the prognostic significance of B and T lymphocytes and immune checkpoint proteins expression in DCIS.MethodsA well characterised DCIS cohort (n = 700) with long-term follow-up comprising pure DCIS (n = 508) and DCIS mixed with invasive carcinoma (IBC; n = 192) were stained immunohistochemically for CD20, CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD1 and PDL1. Copy number variation and TP53 mutation status were assessed in a subset of cases (n = 58).ResultsCD3+ lymphocytes were the predominant cell subtype in the pure DCIS cohort, while FOXP3 showed the lowest levels. PDL1 expression was mainly seen in the stromal TILs. Higher abundance of TILs subtypes was associated with higher tumour grade, hormone receptor negativity and HER2 positivity. Mutant TP53 variants were associated with higher levels of stromal CD3+, CD4+ and FOXP3+ cells. DCIS coexisting with invasive carcinoma harboured denser stromal infiltrates of all immune cells and checkpoint proteins apart from CD4+ cells. Stromal PD1 was the most differentially expressed protein between DCIS and invasive carcinoma (Z = 5.8, p < 0.0001). Dense TILs, stromal FOXP3 and PDL1 were poor prognostic factors for DCIS recurrence, while dense TILs were independently associated with poor outcome for all recurrences (HR = 7.0; p = 0.024), and invasive recurrence (HR = 2.1; p = 0.029).ConclusionsImmunosuppressive proteins are potential markers for high risk DCIS and disease progression. Different stromal and intratumoural lymphocyte composition between pure DCIS, DCIS associated with IBC and invasive carcinoma play a potential role in their prognostic significance and related to the underlying genomic instability. Assessment of overall TILs provides a promising tool for evaluation of the DCIS immune microenvironment."
"Chromatin organization is a highly orchestrated process that influences gene expression, in part by modulating access of regulatory factors to DNA and nucleosomes. Here, we report that the chromatin accessibility regulator HMGN1, a target of recurrent DNA copy gains in leukemia, controls myeloid differentiation. HMGN1 amplification is associated with increased accessibility, expression, and histone H3K27 acetylation of loci important for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia, such as HoxA cluster genes. In vivo, HMGN1 overexpression is linked to decreased quiescence and increased HSC activity in bone marrow transplantation. HMGN1 overexpression also cooperates with the AML-ETO9a fusion oncoprotein to impair myeloid differentiation and enhance leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity. Inhibition of histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 relieves the HMGN1-associated differentiation block. These data nominate factors that modulate chromatin accessibility as regulators of HSCs and LSCs, and suggest that targeting HMGN1 or its downstream effects on histone acetylation could be therapeutically active in AML."
"Therapy of choice for the primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death is the implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Whereas appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks lead to myocardial microdamage, this is not known for antitachycardia pacing (ATP). In total, 150 ICD recipients (66 ± 12 years, 81.3% male, 93.3% primary prevention, 30.0% resynchronization therapy) were randomly assigned to an ICD implantation with or without intraoperative ATP. In the group with ATP, the pacing maneuver was performed twice, each time applying 8 impulses à 6 Volt x 1.0 milliseconds to the myocardium. High sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) levels were determined prior to the implantation and thereafter. There was no significant difference in the release of hsTnT between the two randomization groups (delta TnT without ATP in median 0.010 ng/ml [min. −0.016 ng/ml–max. 0.075 ng/ml] vs. with ATP in median 0.013 ng/ml [min. −0.005–0.287 ng/ml], p = 0.323). Setting a hsTnT cutoff of 0.059 ng/dl as a regularly augmented postoperative hsTnT level, no relevant difference between the two groups regarding the postoperative hsTnT levels above this cutoff could be identified (without ATP n = 10 [14.7%] vs. with ATP n = 16 [21.9%], p = 0.287). There was no significant difference in the release of high sensitive Troponin between patients without intraoperative ATP compared to those with intraoperative ATP. Hence, antitachycardia pacing does not seem to cause significant myocardial microdamage. This may further support its use as a painless and efficient method to terminate ventricular tachycardia in high-risk patients."
"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall and the primary underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. Data from in vivo imaging, cell-lineage tracing and knockout studies in mice, as well as clinical interventional studies and advanced mRNA sequencing techniques, have drawn attention to the role of T cells as critical drivers and modifiers of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. CD4+ T cells are commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. A large body of evidence indicates that T helper 1 (TH1) cells have pro-atherogenic roles and regulatory T (Treg) cells have anti-atherogenic roles. However, Treg cells can become pro-atherogenic. The roles in atherosclerosis of other TH cell subsets such as TH2, TH9, TH17, TH22, follicular helper T cells and CD28null T cells, as well as other T cell subsets including CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells, are less well understood. Moreover, some T cells seem to have both pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic functions. In this Review, we summarize the knowledge on T cell subsets, their functions in atherosclerosis and the process of T cell homing to atherosclerotic plaques. Much of our understanding of the roles of T cells in atherosclerosis is based on findings from experimental models. Translating these findings into human disease is challenging but much needed. T cells and their specific cytokines are attractive targets for developing new preventive and therapeutic approaches including potential T cell-related therapies for atherosclerosis."
"BackgroundCardiotoxicity is the most significant adverse event associated with trastuzumab (T), the main component of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) treatment. Less is known about the cardiotoxicity of dual HER2 blockade with T plus lapatinib (L), although this regimen is used in the metastatic setting.MethodsThis is a sub-analysis of the ALTTO trial comparing adjuvant treatment options for patients with early HER2-positive BC. Patients randomised to either T or concomitant T + L were eligible. Cardiac events (CEs) rates were compared according to treatment arm.ResultsWith 6.9 years of median follow-up (FU) and 4190 patients, CE were observed in 363 (8.6%): 166 (7.9%) of patient in T + L arm vs. 197 (9.3%) in T arm (OR = 0.85 [95% CI, 0.68–1.05]). During anti-HER2 treatment 270 CE (6.4%) occurred while 93 (2.2%) were during FU (median time to onset = 6.6 months [IQR = 3.4–11.7]). While 265 CEs were asymptomatic (73%), 94 were symptomatic (26%) and four were cardiac deaths (1%). Recovery was observed in 301 cases (83.8%). Identified cardiac risk factors were: baseline LVEF < 55% (vs > 64%, OR 3.1 [95% CI 1.54–6.25]), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.85 [95% CI 1.25–2.75]), BMI > 30 kg/m2 (vs < 25 mg/kg2, OR 2.21 [95% CI 1.40–3.49]), cumulative dose of doxorubicin ≥240 mg/m2 (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.01–1.82]) and of epirubicin≥ 480 mg/m2 (OR 2.33 [95% CI 1.55–3.51]).ConclusionsDual HER2 blockade with T + L is a safe regimen from a cardiac perspective, but cardiac-focused history for proper patient selection is crucial.Trial registration numberClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00490139 (registration date: 22/06/2007); EudraCT Number: 2006–000562–36 (registration date: 04/05/2007); Sponsor Protocol Number: BIG2–06 /EGF106708/N063D."
"This study aimed to assess atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence and predictive factors in hypertensive patients and to formulate an AF risk assessment score that can be used to identify the patients most likely to develop AF. This was a cohort study of patients recruited in primary healthcare centers. Patients aged 40 years or older with hypertension, free of AF and with no previous cardiovascular events were included. Patients attended annual visits according to clinical practice until the end of study or onset of AF. The association between AF incidence and explanatory variables (age, sex, body mass index, medical history and other) was analyzed. Finally, 12,206 patients were included (52.6% men, and mean age was 64.9 years); the mean follow-up was 36.7 months, and 394 (3.2%) patients were diagnosed with AF. The incidence of AF was 10.5/1000 person-years. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.08), male sex (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.53–2.31), obesity (HR 2.57; 95% CI 1.70–3.90), and heart failure (HR 2.44; 95% CI 1.45–4.11) were independent predictors (p < 0.001). We propose a risk score based on significant predictors, which enables the identification of people with hypertension who are at the greatest risk of AF."
"Humans and rodents with Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) mutations manifest nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here we show that liver CGI-58 knockout (LivKO) mice fed a Western diet rapidly develop advanced NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic fibrosis. After 14 weeks of diet challenge, starting at 6 weeks of age, LivKO mice showed increased inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression in the liver, which was associated with elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases. Hepatic ductular reactions, pericellular fibrosis, and bridging fibrosis were observed only in the LivKO mice. Consistently, the KO mice had a significant increase in hepatic mRNAs for fibrogenic genes. In addition, LivKO mice displayed massive accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes. LDs were also observed in the cholangiocytes of the LivKO mice, but not the floxed controls. Four of the five LD coat proteins, including perilipins 2, 3, 4, and 5, were increased in the CGI-58 KO liver. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CGI-58 in Huh7 human hepatoma cells induced LD deposition and perilipin expression, suggesting a cell autonomous effect. Our findings establish the Western diet-fed LivKO mice as an animal model of NASH and hepatic fibrosis. These animals may facilitate preclinical screening of therapeutic agents that counter against NAFLD progression."
"We report epidemiological and clinical investigations on ten pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection cases confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Symptoms in these cases were nonspecific and no children required respiratory support or intensive care. Chest X-rays lacked definite signs of pneumonia, a defining feature of the infection in adult cases. Notably, eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, raising the possibility of fecal–oral transmission."
"Intestinal permeability and neutrophil activity are closely linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathophysiology. Here we discuss two techniques for assessing permeability and neutrophil activity in mouse IBD models using near infrared (NIR) detection. To address the limitation of visible light readouts—namely high background—IRDye 800CW was used to enable rapid, non-terminal measurements of intestinal permeability. The increased sensitivity of NIR readouts for colon permeability is shown using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and anti-CD40 murine colitis models in response to interleukin-22 immunoglobulin Fc (IL22Fc) fusion protein and anti-p40 monoclonal antibody treatments, respectively. In addition to enhanced permeability, elevated levels of neutrophil elastase (NE) have been reported in inflamed colonic mucosal tissue. Activatable NIR fluorescent probes have been extensively used for disease activity evaluation in oncologic animal models, and we demonstrate their translatability using a NE-activatable reagent to evaluate inflammation in DSS mice. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and tissue imaging allow visualization of spatial NE activity throughout diseased colon as well as changes in disease severity from IL22Fc treatment. Our findings with the 800CW dye and the NE probe highlight the ease of their implementation in preclinical IBD research."
"Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of bone marrow plasma cells, with a 5-year survival rate of 43%. Its incidence has increased by 126% since 1990. Treatment typically involves high-dose combination chemotherapy, but therapeutic response and patient survival are unpredictable and highly variable—attributed largely to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR is the simultaneous cross-resistance to a range of unrelated chemotherapeutic agents and is associated with poor prognosis and survival. Currently, no clinical procedures allow for a direct, continuous monitoring of MDR. We identified circulating large extracellular vesicles (specifically microparticles (MPs)) that can be used to monitor disease burden, disease progression and development of MDR in myeloma. These MPs differ phenotypically in the expression of four protein biomarkers: a plasma-cell marker (CD138), the MDR protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the stem-cell marker (CD34); and phosphatidylserine (PS), an MP marker and mediator of cancer spread. Elevated levels of P-gp+ and PS+ MPs correlate with disease progression and treatment unresponsiveness. Furthermore, P-gp, PS and CD34 are predominantly expressed in CD138− MPs in advanced disease. In particular, a dual-positive (CD138−P-gp+CD34+) population is elevated in aggressive/unresponsive disease. Our test provides a personalised liquid biopsy with potential to address the unmet clinical need of monitoring MDR and treatment failure in myeloma."
"Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years (CTS5) is a promising prognostic tool to evaluate late recurrence risk for breast cancer. Our study aimed to validate its prognostic value in large-scale population and explore the impact of menopausal and HER2 status on CTS5 model. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Survival analyses were conducted to assess the prognostic value of CTS5 in different breast cancer subgroups in terms of overall survival (OS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) after five years. A total of 23,168 breast cancer patients with positive hormone receptor (HoR) were enrolled. Postmenopausal and premenopausal patients were 13,686 and 9,482, respectively. Taking CTS5 score as a continuous variable, it had significant positive correlation with poor prognosis beyond five years in both postmenopausal and premenopausal subgroups. Nevertheless, for HER2+ postmenopausal patients, the model has less effective prognostic value on long-term BCSS [HR1.177 (95%CI 0.960–1.443), p = 0.117]. Using CTS5 score as a categorical variable, HER2- patients with high-risk level revealed significant poor survival in terms of both BCSS and OS, irrespective of menopausal status. Our study showed the CTS5 model could be a useful prognostic tool for predict long-term survival in HoR+/HER2- patients. And further large-scale studies are warranted to assess its prognostic value for HER2+ patients and develop novel prediction model for late recurrence risk estimation."
"In young children with small angle exotropia, making decisions for the individual patient whether to perform surgery or not, and choosing the optimal time for surgical intervention are quite difficult. We aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of small angle intermittent exotropia of 20 prism diopters (PD) or less after observation versus strabismus surgery. A retrospective study was performed on 164 patients aged 3 to 13 who underwent surgical intervention or observation with or without conservative management for intermittent exotropia of 14 to 20 PD. The minimum follow-up period was 2 years. The average follow-up period was 3.9 ± 2.2 years in the observation group and 4.5 ± 2.3 years in the surgery group. At the final examination, the mean angle of deviation at distance was 11.1 ± 8.9 PD in the observation group and 9.0 ± 7.5 PD in the surgery group, which was not significantly different (P = 0.121). Changes in sensory outcome and fusional control were not significantly different between both groups (P = 0.748 and P = 0.968). Subgroup analysis including patients with poor fusional control also showed similar results. By multivariate analysis, the type of surgery, unilateral recess-resect procedure, was the only predictive factor of good motor outcome in the surgery group. In conclusion, long-term surgical outcomes in small angle exotropia did not appear to be more satisfying than observation in terms of motor and sensory outcomes."
"Petroclival meningiomas (PCMs) are regarded as one of the most formidable challenges in neurosurgery. We retrospectively assessed the surgical outcomes of PCMs based on a tumor classification to evaluate the long-term outcomes. A series of 168 patients with PCMs from July 1996 to January 2017. On the basis of the difference in the origin of dural attachment and patterns of growth, the PCMs were classified into 4 different types. The clinical characteristics, surgical record, and follow-up data of each type were reviewed. The study included 138 females (82.1%) with an average age of 49.9 ± 16.2 years. And 138 cases (82.1%) had developed neurological deficits preoperatively with the average tumor size of 44.0 ± 10.6 mm. Specific surgical approaches were applied depended on the tumor classification. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 119 cases (70.8%) with the complications of 46 cases (27.7%). With a median follow-up of 86.5 months, there were 41 cases of recurrence/progress (25.7%) and 39 cases of morbidity (26.4%). Compared with the non-GTR group, the GTR significantly decreased the R/P rate (P = 0.001), prolonged the R/P-FS time (P = 0.032) and improved the follow-up neurological status (P = 0.026). Favorable outcomes and acceptable morbidity were achieved with the treatment strategy of the choice of specific approaches for each type. Meanwhile, the differences of each type in diverse clinical characteristic were verified. Individualized assessment and suitable approach choice should be based on the tumor classification to improved the GTR and quality of life for patients."
"Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a hereditary neuropathy mainly caused by gene mutation of peripheral myelin proteins including myelin protein zero (P0, MPZ). Large myelin protein zero (L-MPZ) is an isoform of P0 that contains an extended polypeptide synthesized by translational readthrough at the C-terminus in tetrapods, including humans. The physiological role of L-MPZ and consequences of an altered L-MPZ/P0 ratio in peripheral myelin are not known. To clarify this, we used genome editing to generate a mouse line (L-MPZ mice) that produced L-MPZ instead of P0. Motor tests and electrophysiological, immunohistological, and electron microscopy analyses show that homozygous L-MPZ mice exhibit CMT-like phenotypes including thin and/or loose myelin, increased small-caliber axons, and disorganized axo–glial interactions. Heterozygous mice show a milder phenotype. These results highlight the importance of an appropriate L-MPZ/P0 ratio and show that aberrant readthrough of a myelin protein causes neuropathy."
"Interaction of malignancies with tissue-specific immune cells has gained interest for prognosis and intervention of emerging immunotherapies. We analyzed bone marrow T cells (bmT) as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in pediatric precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Based on data from 100 patients, we show that ALL is associated with late-stage CD4+ phenotype and loss of early CD8+ T cells. The inhibitory exhaustion marker TIM-3 on CD4+ bmT increased relapse risk (RFS = 94.6/70.3%) confirmed by multivariate analysis. The hazard ratio of TIM-3 expression nearly reached the hazard ratio of MRD (7.1 vs. 8.0) indicating that patients with a high frequency of TIM-3+CD4+ bone marrow T cells at initial diagnosis have a 7.1-fold increased risk to develop ALL relapse. Comparison of wild type primary T cells to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TIM-3 knockout and TIM-3 overexpression confirmed the negative effect of TIM-3 on T cell responses against ALL. TIM-3+CD4+ bmT are increased in ALL overexpressing CD200, that leads to dysfunctional antileukemic T cell responses. In conclusion, TIM-3-mediated interaction between bmT and leukemia cells is shown as a strong risk factor for relapse in pediatric B-lineage ALL. CD200/TIM-3-signaling, rather than PD-1/PD-L1, is uncovered as a mechanism of T cell dysfunction in ALL with major implication for future immunotherapies."
"22q11.2, 15q13.3, and 1q21.1 microdeletions attract considerable interest by conferring high risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. A fundamental open question is whether divergent or convergent neural mechanisms mediate this genetic pleiotropic association with the same behavioral phenotypes. We use a combination of rodent microdeletion models with high-field neuroimaging to perform a comparative whole-brain characterization of functional and structural mechanisms linked to high-risk states. Resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on mice carrying heterozygous microdeletions in 22q11.2 (N = 12), 15q13.3 (N = 11), and 1q21.1 (N = 11) loci. We performed network-based statistic, graph, and morphometric analyses. The three microdeletions did not share significant systems-level features. Instead, morphometric analyses revealed microcephaly in 1q21.1 and macrocephaly in 15q13.3 deletions, whereas cerebellar volume was specifically reduced in 22q11.2 deletion. In function, 22q11.2 deletion mice showed widespread cortical hypoconnectivity, accompanied by opposing hyperconnectivity in dopaminergic pathways, which was confirmed by graph analysis. 1q21.1 exhibited distinct changes in posterior midbrain morphology and function, especially in periaqueductal gray, whereas 15q13.3 demonstrated alterations in auditory/striatal system. The combination of cortical hypoconnectivity and dopaminergic hyperconnectivity and reduced cerebellum in 22q11.2 deletion mirrors key neurodevelopmental features of schizophrenia, whereas changes in midbrain and auditory/striatal morphology and topology in 1q21.1 and 15q13.3 rather indicate focal processes possibly linked to the emergence of abnormal salience perception and hallucinations. In addition to insights into pathophysiological processes in these microdeletions, our results establish the general point that microdeletions might increase risk for overlapping neuropsychiatric phenotypes through separable neural mechanisms."
"Sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) is the third most frequent cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths (mainly due metastatic dissemination). We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of frequently altered proteins in primary tumors from 51 patients (25 liver metastatic and 26 non-metastatic cases) with a median 103 months follow-up (103 months). We evaluated EGFR copy number (using SNP arrays and FISH) and its expression and regulation (by mRNA and miRNA arrays). We found differences between metastatic and non-metastatic sCRCs for MLH1 (p = 0.05), PMS2 (p = 0.02), CEA (p < 0.001) and EGFR (p < 0.001) expression. EGFR expression was associated with lymph node metastases (p = 0.001), liver metastases at diagnosis (p < 0.001), and advanced stage (p < 0.001). There were associations between EGFR expression-, EGFR gene copy number- and EGFR mRNA levels. We found potential interactions of two miRNAs targeting EGFR expression, (miR-134 and miR-4328, in non-metastatic and metastatic tumors, respectively). EGFR expression was associated with a worse outcome (p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for overall survival identified that, the expression of EGFR expression (p = 0.047) and pTNM stage (p < 0.001) predicted an adverse outcome. EGFR expression could be regulated by amplification or polysomies (in metastatic tumors), or miRNAs (miRNA-134, in non-metastatic tumors). EGFR expression in sCRC appears to be related to metastases and poor outcome."
"Dietary intake, eating behaviors, and context are important in chronic disease development, yet our ability to accurately assess these in research settings can be limited by biased traditional self-reporting tools. Objective measurement tools, specifically, wearable sensors, present the opportunity to minimize the major limitations of self-reported eating measures by generating supplementary sensor data that can improve the validity of self-report data in naturalistic settings. This scoping review summarizes the current use of wearable devices/sensors that automatically detect eating-related activity in naturalistic research settings. Five databases were searched in December 2019, and 618 records were retrieved from the literature search. This scoping review included N = 40 studies (from 33 articles) that reported on one or more wearable sensors used to automatically detect eating activity in the field. The majority of studies (N = 26, 65%) used multi-sensor systems (incorporating > 1 wearable sensors), and accelerometers were the most commonly utilized sensor (N = 25, 62.5%). All studies (N = 40, 100.0%) used either self-report or objective ground-truth methods to validate the inferred eating activity detected by the sensor(s). The most frequently reported evaluation metrics were Accuracy (N = 12) and F1-score (N = 10). This scoping review highlights the current state of wearable sensors’ ability to improve upon traditional eating assessment methods by passively detecting eating activity in naturalistic settings, over long periods of time, and with minimal user interaction. A key challenge in this field, wide variation in eating outcome measures and evaluation metrics, demonstrates the need for the development of a standardized form of comparability among sensors/multi-sensor systems and multidisciplinary collaboration."
"Laryngeal cancer (LC) patients who meet the age and smoking criteria of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for annual CT lung screening were analysed for pulmonary nodules (PN) detection and secondary lung cancer (SLC) diagnosis. This is a retrospective chart review of LC patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital from January 2010 to December 2017. The study population included patients who met USPSTF criteria by age and smoking history for annual chest screening and were followed for at least 3 consecutive years. A total of 998 LC patients’ records were reviewed, of which 151 met the inclusion criteria. Inadequate follow-up period (37% of excluded cases) was the most common reason for exclusion, followed by not meeting USPSTF age criteria (27% excluded cases). In seventy-eight patients (n = 78, 52% of analysed patients) PN were reported. Nine individuals (6% of analysed patients) were diagnosed with SLC. Age over 70 (p = 0.003) was an independent predictor of malignancy. White race and smoking history over 40 pack-years were positively associated with a pulmonary nodule detection (p = 0.037 and p = 0.044, respectively). The incidence of PN and SLC in patients with LC is high. Many patients with laryngeal cancer meet the formal guidelines for USPSTF screening, and should be screened annually according to evidence-based medicine for the early detection of secondary lung cancers."
"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in several pathophysiologic processes in vascular diseases, including progressive loss of elasticity of the vessel wall (arterial stiffness). Circulating soluble receptors for AGEs (sRAGE) act as a decoy and counterbalanced the harmful properties of AGEs as the natural protective factor. We compared the role of circulating or skin-deposed AGEs and sRAGE regarding the natural course of arterial stiffening. In a prospective cohort study, we longitudinally followed 536 general population-based subjects (subsample of Czech post-MONICA study). Aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was measured twice (at baseline and after ~8 years of follow-up) using a SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical Ltd), and the intraindividual change in PWV per year (∆PWV/year) was calculated. Concentrations of sRAGE and carboxymethyl lysine (circulating AGEs) were assessed at the follow-up visit by ELISA, while skin AGEs were measured using the autofluorescence-based device AGE Reader. Using multiple regressions, we found significant association between ∆PWV/year as a dependent variable, and both, sRAGE and skin AGEs as independent ones (each on its own model). However, the closest associations to ∆PWV/year were found for the ratio of these two factors (skin AGEs/sRAGE) [β coeff = 0.0747 (SE 0.0189), p < 0.0001]. In a categorized manner, subjects with skin AGEs/sRAGE ratio ≥ 3.3 showed about twofold higher risk having ΔPWV/year ≥ 0.2 m/s [adjusted odds ratio was 2.09 (95% CI: 1.35–3.22), p = 0.001]. In contrast, neither circulating AGEs nor circulating AGEs/sRAGE showed any significant relation to ΔPWV/year. In conclusion, skin AGEs/sRAGE ratio seems to be a more sensitive biomarker of vascular aging than these single factors themselves or circulation status of AGEs."
"Visceral leishmaniasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum. The drugs currently used to treat visceral leishmaniasis suffer from toxicity and the emergence of parasite resistance, and so a better solution would be the development of an effective subunit vaccine; however, no approved vaccine currently exists. The comparative testing of a large number of vaccine candidates requires a quantitative and reproducible experimental murine infection model, but the parameters that influence infection pathology have not been systematically determined. To address this, we have established an infection model using a transgenic luciferase-expressing L. donovani parasite and longitudinally quantified the infections using in vivo bioluminescent imaging within individual mice. We examined the effects of varying the infection route, the site of adjuvant formulation administration, and standardised the parasite preparation and dose. We observed that the increase in parasite load within the liver during the first few weeks of infection was directly proportional to the parasite number in the initial inoculum. Finally, we show that immunity can be induced in pre-exposed animals that have resolved an initial infection. This murine infection model provides a platform for systematic subunit vaccine testing against visceral leishmaniasis."
"Clozapine is the gold-standard agent for treatment resistant schizophrenia but its mechanism of action remains unclear. There is emerging evidence of the potential role of the GABAB receptor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. It has been hypothesised that clozapine can mediate its actions via the GABAB receptor. Baclofen is currently recognised as the prototype GABAB receptor agonist. There are some potential clinical similarities between clozapine and baclofen. Indeed, baclofen has been previously proposed for use as an antipsychotic agent. Our analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of GABAB receptor along with molecular docking calculations, suggests that clozapine could directly bind to the GABAB receptor similar to that of baclofen. This finding could lead to a better understanding of the pharmacological uniqueness of clozapine, potential development of a biomarker for treatment resistant schizophrenia and the development of more targeted treatments leading to personalisation of treatment."
"The effects of nutritional support on well-nourished patients have been investigated, but the results were inconsistent among different articles. We performed the meta-analysis to examine the existing evidence. We systematically retrieved articles from PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to identify the evidence of nutritional support for well-nourished patients. Methodological quality assessment was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook and GRADE. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one non-RCT with 1400 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Nutritional support, particularly immunonutrition, was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative infectious complications (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57–0.96), and a decreasing trends in morbidity and the length of the hospital stay (LOS) were observed. However, the mortality rates were comparable between two groups. The quality of evidence was moderate to high. Nutritional support, particularly immunonutrition supplementation, is likely to reduce infectious complications, morbidity and LOS without influencing mortality and may be a safe and preferred choice for well-nourished patients undergoing surgery for cancer. However, additional RCTs are warranted to determine the effects of nutritional support on well-nourished patients."
"Ca2+/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (Ca2+/NFAT) signaling pathway may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD). We investigated the poorly understood Ca2+/NFAT regulation of coronary artery endothelial cells and consequent dysfunction in KD pathogenesis. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) stimulated with sera from patients with KD, compared with sera from healthy children, exhibited significant increases in proliferation and angiogenesis, higher levels of NFATc1 and NFATc3 and some inflammatory molecules, and increased nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and NFATc3. HCAECs stimulated with sera from patients with KD treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) showed decreased proliferation, angiogenesis, NFATc1 and inflammatory molecules levels as compared with results for untreated HCAECs. In conclusion, our data reveal that KD sera activate the Ca2+/NFAT in HCAECs, leading to dysfunction and inflammation of endothelial cells. CsA has cytoprotective effects by ameliorating endothelial cell homeostasis via Ca2+/NFAT."
"Background/ObjectivesThe winter holiday season in the United States, which spans mid-November to mid-January, contributes to over half of annual body weight gain. Although self-reported data have linked this weight change to both increased energy intake and reduced physical activity, objective techniques have never been used; and thus, the actual cause of holiday weight gain is controversial. Here, we aimed to determine changes in components of energy balance leading to the holiday weight gain.MethodsBody weight change was compared between the pre-holiday (mid-September to mid-November) and the holiday period (mid-November to early January). Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using doubly labeled water during holiday time (early to mid-December). Subjective (ratings) and physiological (appetite-regulating hormones) measures of appetite, eating-away-from-home frequency, and incentive salience of food pictures were also evaluated.ResultsIn 23 obese adults (87% female), body weight change during the holidays (0.41 ± 0.42 kg) was significantly higher (P = 0.02) than the body weight change during the pre-holiday period (−0.86 ± 0.42 kg). TEE was unchanged during the two periods, suggesting no role of energy expenditure on weight gain. However, participants reported lower satisfaction after a meal pre-load which was significantly correlated with increased body weight during the holiday period. An increase in number of episodes of eating at sit-down restaurants was also reported during that period. Overall, these changing behaviors were supported by a non-significant increase in energy intake (+80 kcal/day, P = 0.07) observed during the study holiday period.ConclusionWe conclude that a decrease in energy expenditure does not result in the weight increase, but that increase in food intake is the more likely cause. Our data imply that compromised internal satiety mechanisms in presence of external food cues and diet-related behavioral variables during the holidays may influence weight gain."
"Nanoclays have generated interest in biomaterial design for their ability to enhance the mechanics of polymeric materials and impart biological function. As well as their utility as physical cross-linkers, clays have been explored for sustained localization of biomolecules to promote in vivo tissue regeneration. To date, both biomolecule-clay and polymer-clay nanocomposite strategies have utilised the negatively charged clay particle surface. As such, biomolecule-clay and polymer-clay interactions are set in competition, potentially limiting the functional enhancements achieved. Here, we apply specific bisphosphonate interactions with the positively charged clay particle edge to develop self-assembling hydrogels and functionalized clay nanoparticles with preserved surface exchange capacity. Low concentrations of nanoclay are applied to cross-link hyaluronic acid polymers derivatised with a pendant bisphosphonate to generate hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties and preserved protein binding able to sustain, for over six weeks in vivo, the localized activity of the clinically licensed growth factor BMP-2."
"Diets rich in sugar and saturated fat are associated with cognitive impairments in both humans and rodents with several potential mechanisms proposed. To test the involvement of diet-induced pro-inflammatory signaling, we exposed rats to a high-fat, high-sugar cafeteria diet, and administered the anti-inflammatory antibiotic minocycline. In the first experiment minocycline was coadministered across the diet, then in a second, independent cohort it was introduced following 4 weeks of cafeteria diet. Cafeteria diet impaired novel place recognition memory throughout the study. Minocycline not only prevented impairment in spatial recognition memory but also reversed impairment established in rats following 4 weeks cafeteria diet. Further, minocycline normalized diet-induced increases in hippocampal pro-inflammatory gene expression. No effects of minocycline were seen on adiposity or dietary intake across the experiments. Cafeteria diet and minocycline treatment significantly altered microbiome composition. The relative abundance of Desulfovibrio_OTU31, uniquely enriched in vehicle-treated cafeteria-fed rats, negatively and significantly correlated with spatial recognition memory. We developed a statistical model that accurately predicts spatial recognition memory based on Desulfovibrio_OTU31 relative abundance and fat mass. Thus, our results show that minocycline prevents and reverses a dietary-induced diet impairment in spatial recognition memory, and that spatial recognition performance is best predicted by changes in body composition and Desulfovibrio_OTU31, rather than changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression."
"Differentiating cardiac amyloidosis (CA) from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains a clinical challenge, particularly in those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and similar hypertrophy. This study aimed to use left ventricular global function index (LVGFI) and myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) to discriminate CA from HCM without using contrast agents on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). In total, we included 68 CA patients, 90 HCM patients, and 35 healthy controls. We found that LVGFI had excellent diagnostic performance in differentiating CA from HCM (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, 95% CI [0.86–0.95]), even in the challenging conditions of similar hypertrophy (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI [0.87–0.97]) and preserved LVEF (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI [0.84–0.96]). LVGFI also had significant correlations with LGE extent, NT-proBNP and troponin T (all p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that LVGFI was an independent predictor of CA (odds ratio: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01–1.23; p = 0.034). In conclusion, LVGFI is a novel and clinically useful parameters with excellent ability in determining myocardial function and differentiating cardiac amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
"Whether dynamic change in waist circumference is associated with progression from prehypertension to hypertension is not well understood. We explored this issue. A total of 4221 prehypertensive adults ≥18 years were enrolled during 2007–2008 and followed up during 2013–2014. Participants were classified by percentage waist-circumference change at follow-up: ≤−2.5, −2.5 to ≤2.5, 2.5 to ≤5.0, and >5.0%. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with logistic regression models, with stable waist-circumference change (−2.5 to 2.5%) as the reference. During the 6 years of follow-up, 1464 prehypertensive patients (851 women) showed progression to hypertension, with an incidence rate of 32.7% for men and 36.3% for women. As compared with stable waist circumference, a waist-circumference gain > 5.0% was associated with increased hypertension risk: adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.08 (1.01–1.14) for men and 1.09 (1.04–1.15) for women. The risk also decreased significantly for men with ≥2.5% waist-circumference loss (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.88–1.00). We found a linear association between percentage waist-circumference gain and risk of progression from prehypertension to hypertension for both sexes by restricted cubic splines (pnonlinearity = 0.772 for men and 0.779 for women). For each 10% gain in waist circumference, the risk increased by 8% for men and 5% for women. The association remained significant for both sexes in a subgroup analysis by abdominal obesity at baseline. The long-term gain in waist circumference significantly increased the risk of progression from prehypertension to hypertension for both sexes in a rural Chinese population, regardless of abdominal obesity status at baseline."
"BackgroundStatins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Epidemiological and pre-clinical evidence support an association between statin use and delayed prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Here, we evaluated the effects of neoadjuvant fluvastatin treatment on markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis in men with localized PCa.MethodsThirty-three men were treated daily with 80 mg fluvastatin for 4–12 weeks in a single-arm window-of-opportunity study between diagnosis of localized PCa and radical prostatectomy (RP) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01992042). Percent Ki67 and cleaved Caspase-3 (CC3)-positive cells in tumor tissues were evaluated in 23 patients by immunohistochemistry before and after treatment. Serum and intraprostatic fluvastatin concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.ResultsBaseline characteristics included a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 6.48 ng/mL (IQR: 4.21–10.33). The median duration of fluvastatin treatment was 49 days (range: 27–102). Median serum low-density lipoprotein levels decreased by 35% after treatment, indicating patient compliance. Median PSA decreased by 12%, but this was not statistically significant in our small cohort. The mean fluvastatin concentration measured in the serum was 0.2 μM (range: 0.0–1.1 μM), and in prostatic tissue was 8.5 nM (range: 0.0–77.0 nM). At these concentrations, fluvastatin induced PCa cell death in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In patients, fluvastatin treatment did not significantly alter intratumoral Ki67 positivity; however, a median 2.7-fold increase in CC3 positivity (95% CI: 1.9–5.0, p = 0.007) was observed in post-fluvastatin RP tissues compared with matched pre-treatment biopsy controls. In a subset analysis, this increase in CC3 was more pronounced in men on fluvastatin for >50 days.ConclusionsFluvastatin prior to RP achieves measurable drug concentrations in prostatic tissue and is associated with promising effects on tumor cell apoptosis. These data warrant further investigation into the anti-neoplastic effects of statins in prostate tissue."
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a more aggressive phenotype and higher metastasis and recurrence rates than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC currently lacks a transplantation model that is suitable for clinical simulations of the tumor microenvironment. Intraductal injection of tumor cells into the mammary duct could mimic the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Herein, we injected 4T1 cells into the mammary ducts of BALB/C mice to build a preclinical model of TNBC and optimized the related construction method to observe the occurrence and spontaneous metastasis of tumors. We compared the effects of different cell numbers on tumorigenesis rates, times to tumorigenesis, and metastases to determine the optimal number of cells for modelling. We demonstrated that 4T1-MIND model mice injected with 20,000 cells revealed a suitable tumor formation rate and time, thus indicating a potential treatment time window after distant metastasis. We also injected 20,000 cells directly into the breast fat pad or breast duct for parallel comparison. The results still showed that the 4T1-MIND model provides sufficient treatment time for lung metastases in mice and that it is a more reliable model for early tumor development. The 4T1-MIND model requires continuous improvement and optimization. A suitable and optimized model for translational research and studies on the microenvironment in TNBC should be developed."
"Cancer is a life-threatening disease that affects one in three people. Although most cases are sporadic, cancer risk can be increased by genetic factors. It remains unknown why certain genes predispose for specific forms of cancer only, such as checkpoint protein 2 (CHK2), in which gene mutations convey up to twofold higher risk for breast cancer but do not increase lung cancer risk. We have investigated the role of CHK2 and the related kinase checkpoint protein 1 (CHK1) in cell cycle regulation in primary breast and lung primary epithelial cells. At the molecular level, CHK1 activity was higher in lung cells, whereas CHK2 was more active in breast cells. Inhibition of CHK1 profoundly disrupted the cell cycle profile in both lung and breast cells, whereas breast cells were more sensitive toward inhibition of CHK2. Finally, we provide evidence that breast cells require CHK2 to induce a G2–M cell cycle arrest in response of DNA damage, whereas lung cells can partially compensate for the loss of CHK2. Our results provide an explanation as to why CHK2 germline mutations predispose for breast cancer but not for lung cancer."
"Perturbations in lipid metabolic pathways to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements is a principal characteristic of cancer cells. Sphingolipids (SPLs) are the largest class of bioactive lipids associated to various aspects of tumorigenesis and have been extensively studied in cancer cell lines and experimental models. The clinical relevance of SPLs in human malignancies however is still poorly understood and needs further investigation. In the present study, we adopted a UHPLC-High resolution (orbitrap) Mass spectrometry (HRMS) approach to identify various sphingolipid species in breast cancer patients. A total of 49 SPLs falling into 6 subcategories have been identified. Further, integrating the multivariate analysis with metabolomics enabled us to identify an elevation in the levels of ceramide phosphates and sphingosine phosphates in tumor tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues. The expression of genes involved in the synthesis of reported metabolites was also determined in local as well as TCGA cohort. A significant upregulation in the expression of CERK and SPHK1 was observed in tumor tissues in local and TCGA cohort. Sphingomyelin levels were found to be high in adjacent normal tissues. Consistent with the above findings, expression of SGMS1 in tumor tissues was downregulated in TCGA cohort only. Clinical correlations of the selected metabolites and their performance as biomarkers was also evaluated. Significant ROC and positive correlation with Ki67 index highlight the diagnostic potential and clinical relevance of ceramide phosphates in breast cancer."
"This manuscript is focused on the use of connected sensor technologies, including wearables and other biosensors, for a wide range of health services, such as collecting digital endpoints in clinical trials and remotely monitoring patients in clinical care. The adoption of these technologies poses five risks that currently exceed our abilities to evaluate and secure these products: (1) validation, (2) security practices, (3) data rights and governance, (4) utility and usability; and (5) economic feasibility. In this manuscript we conduct a landscape analysis of emerging evaluation frameworks developed to better manage these risks, broadly in digital health. We then propose a framework specifically for connected sensor technologies. We provide a pragmatic guide for how to put this evaluation framework into practice, taking lessons from concepts in drug and nutrition labels to craft a connected sensor technology label."
"Cigarette smoking affects the oral microbiome, which is related to various systemic diseases. While studies that investigated the relationship between smoking and the oral microbiome by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing have been performed, investigations involving metagenomic sequences are rare. We investigated the bacterial species composition in the tongue microbiome, as well as single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles and gene content of these species, in never and current smokers by utilizing metagenomic sequences. Among 234 never smokers and 52 current smokers, beta diversity, as assessed by weighted UniFrac measure, differed between never and current smokers (pseudo-F = 8.44, R2 = 0.028, p = 0.001). Among the 26 species that had sufficient coverage, the SNV profiles of Actinomyces graevenitzii, Megasphaera micronuciformis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Veillonella dispar, and one Veillonella sp. were significantly different between never and current smokers. Analysis of gene and pathway content revealed that genes related to the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway in Veillonella dispar were present more frequently in current smokers. We found that species-level tongue microbiome differed between never and current smokers, and 5 species from never and current smokers likely harbor different strains, as suggested by the difference in SNV frequency."
"When two different objects are sequentially presented at the same location, the viewer tends to misjudge them as identical (spatial congruency bias). The present study examined whether the spatial congruency bias would involve not only retinotopic but also non-retinotopic processing using the Ternus-Pikler illusion. In the experiments, two objects (central and peripheral) appeared in an initial frame. The target object was presented in the central area of the display, while the peripheral object was either on the left or right side of the target object. In the second frame, the target object was again presented in the central area, and the peripheral object was on the opposite side. Two kinds of inter-stimulus intervals were used. In the no-blank condition, the target object was perceived as stationary, and the peripheral object appeared to move to the opposite side. However, in the long-blank condition, the two objects were perceived to move together. Participants judged whether the target objects in the two frames were identical. As a result, the spatial congruency bias occurred irrespective of the ISI conditions. Our findings suggest that the spatial congruency bias is mainly based on retinotopic processing."
"Background/objectivesPhysical activity is beneficial to lipid profiles; however, the association between sedentary behavior and sleep and pediatric dyslipidemia remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether sedentary behavior or sleep predicted lipid profiles in children over a 2-year period.Subjects/methodsSix hundered and thirty children from the QUALITY cohort, with at least one obese parent, were assessed prospectively at ages 8–10 and 10–12 years. Measures of sedentary behavior included self-reported TV viewing and computer/video game use. Seven-day accelerometry was used to derive sedentary behavior and sleep duration. Adiposity was assessed using DEXA scans. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls yielded estimates of carbohydrate and fat intake. Outcomes included fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol. Multivariable models were adjusted for adiposity and diet.ResultsAt both Visit 1 (median age 9.6 year) and Visit 2 (median age 11.6 year), children were of normal weight (55%), overweight (22%), or obese (22%). Every additional hour of TV viewing at Visit 1 was associated with a 7.0% triglyceride increase (95% CI: 3.5, 10.6; P < 0.01) and 2.6% HDL decrease (95% CI: −4.2, −0.9; P < 0.01) at Visit 2; findings remained significant after adjusting for adiposity and diet. Every additional hour of sleep at Visit 1 predicted a 4.8% LDL decrease (95% CI: −9.0, −0.5; P = 0.03) at Visit 2, after adjusting for fat intake; this association became nonsignificant once controlling for adiposity.ConclusionsLonger screen time during childhood appears to deteriorate lipid profiles in early adolescence, even after accounting for other major lifestyle habits. There is preliminary evidence of a deleterious effect of shorter sleep duration, which should be considered in further studies."
"The reported influence of donor Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) genes on the outcomes of haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are contradictory, in part due to diversity of disease, donor sources, era and conditioning regimens within and between different studies. Here, we describe the results of a retrospective clinical analysis establishing the effect of donor KIR motifs on the outcomes of 119 HLA-matched, unrelated donor HCT for adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using myeloablative conditioning (MAC) in a predominantly T-cell deplete (TCD) cohort. We observed that HCT involving donors with at least one KIR B haplotype were more likely to result in non-relapse mortality (NRM) than HCT involving donors with two KIR A haplotypes (p = 0.019). Upon separation of KIR haplotypes into their centromeric (Cen) and telomeric (Tel) motif structures, we demonstrated that the Cen-B motif was largely responsible for this effect (p = 0.001). When the cause of NRM was investigated further, infection was the dominant cause of death (p = 0.006). No evidence correlating donor KIR B haplotype with relapse risk was observed. The results from this analysis confirm previous findings in the unrelated, TCD, MAC transplant setting and imply a protective role for donor-encoded Cen-A motifs against infection in allogeneic HCT recipients."
"FLU-v, developed by PepTcell (SEEK), is a peptide vaccine aiming to provide a broadly protective cellular immune response against influenza A and B. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase IIb efficacy and safety trial was conducted. One hundred and fifty-three healthy individuals 18–55 years of age were randomized to receive one or two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v or adjuvanted placebo subcutaneously on days −43 and −22, prior to intranasal challenge on day 0 with the A/California/04/2009/H1N1 human influenza A challenge virus. The primary objective of the study was to identify a reduction in mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) defined as the presence of viral shedding and clinical influenza symptoms. Single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v recipients (n = 40) were significantly less likely to develop MMID after challenge vs placebo (n = 42) (32.5% vs 54.8% p = 0.035). FLU-v should continue to be evaluated and cellular immunity explored further as a possible important correlate of protection against influenza."
"Allergic responses are mainly caused by IgE, which is often located on the cell surface. The current diagnostic method detects both allergen-specific IgE and total IgE levels, but a number of allergic patients have a normal serum IgE level, which is a poor clinical correlate for allergy. Here, we developed a simple method to detect the level of cell-bound IgE by dissociating it from blood cells with lactic acid. Dissociated cell-bound IgE and plasma IgE levels were detected using the same ELISA kit at the same time. We established two clinical cohorts: an allergic patient group and a healthy participant group. In general, cell-bound IgE correlated well with plasma IgE; however, some patients exhibited high cell-bound IgE levels but low plasma IgE levels. We recommended 350 ng/mL peripheral blood total IgE (cell-bound IgE + plasma IgE) as the cut-off value for allergy diagnosis. Using this indicator, 90.32% of our allergic patients were correctly diagnosed. The peripheral blood total IgE level is a promising clinical diagnostic indicator in allergic patients and will provide more guidance for allergy diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation."
"Depth of invasion (DOI) can be calculated preoperatively by MRI, and whether MRI-determined DOI can predict prognosis as well as whether it can be used as an indicator of neck dissection in cT1N0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unknown. The main goal of the current study was to answer these unknowns. A total of 151 patients with surgically treated cT1N0 tongue SCC were retrospectively enrolled, and MRI-determined DOI was measured based on T1-weighted layers with a 3.0T scan. The Chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between clinical pathologic variables and neck lymph node metastasis, and the factors that were significant in the Chi-square test were then analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression analysis model to determine the independent predictors. The main study endpoints were locoregional control (LRC) and disease-specific survival (DSS), and the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test) was used to calculate the LRC and DSS rates. The factors that were significant in univariate analysis were then analyzed in the Cox model to determine the independent prognostic factors. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant, and all statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0. Occult neck lymph node metastasis was noted in 26 (17.2%) patients, and the ROC curve indicated that the optimal cutoff value of MRI-determined DOI was 7.5 mm for predicting neck lymph node metastasis, with a sensitivity of 86.9%. The factors of lymphovascular invasion, MRI-determined DOI, pathologic DOI, and pathologic tumor grade were significantly associated with the presence of neck lymph node metastasis in univariate analysis, and further logistic regression analysis confirmed the independence of lymphovascular invasion, MRI-determined DOI, and pathologic DOI in predicting neck lymph node metastasis. The 5-year LRC and DSS rates were 84% and 90%, respectively. Cox model analysis suggested the MRI-determined DOI was an independent prognostic factor for both LRC and DSS. Therefore, elective neck dissection is suggested if MRI-determined DOI is greater than 7.5 mm in cT1N0 tongue SCC, and MRI-determined DOI ≥ 7.5 mm indicates additional risk for disease recurrence and cancer-related death."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is known to have poor patient outcomes due to development of resistance to chemotherapy agents and the EGFR inhibitors, which results in recurrence of highly aggressive lung tumors. Even with recent success in immunotherapy using the checkpoint inhibitors, additional investigations are essential to identify novel therapeutic strategies for efficacious treatment for NSCLC. Our finding that high levels of histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) in human lung tumor tissues correlate with poor patient outcome and that depletion or inhibition of HDAC11 not only significantly reduces self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from NSCLC but also decreases Sox2 expression that is essential for maintenance of CSCs, indicates that HDAC11 is a potential target to combat NSCLC. We find that HDAC11 suppresses Sox2 expression through the mediation of Gli1, the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor. In addition, we have used highly selective HDAC11 inhibitors that not only target stemness and adherence independent growth of lung cancer cells but these inhibitors could also efficiently ablate the growth of drug-insensitive stem-like cells as well as therapy resistant lung cancer cells. These inhibitors were found to be efficacious even in presence of cancer associated fibroblasts which have been shown to contribute in therapy resistance. Our study presents a novel role of HDAC11 in lung adenocarcinoma progression and the potential use of highly selective inhibitors of HDAC11 in combating lung cancers."
"Aberrant NF-κB activation is a hallmark of most B-cell malignancies. Recurrent inactivating somatic mutations in the NFKBIE gene, which encodes IκBε, an inhibitor of NF-κB-inducible activity, are reported in several B-cell malignancies with highest frequencies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and account for a fraction of NF-κB pathway activation. The impact of NFKBIE deficiency on B-cell development and function remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we show that Nfkbie-deficient mice exhibit an amplification of marginal zone B cells and an expansion of B1 B-cell subsets. In germinal center (GC)-dependent immune response, Nfkbie deficiency triggers expansion of GC B-cells through increasing cell proliferation in a B-cell autonomous manner. We also show that Nfkbie deficiency results in hyperproliferation of a B1 B-cell subset and leads to increased NF-κB activation in these cells upon Toll-like receptor stimulation. Nfkbie deficiency cooperates with mutant MYD88 signaling and enhances B-cell proliferation in vitro. In aged mice, Nfkbie absence drives the development of an oligoclonal indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, resembling monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Collectively, these findings shed light on an essential role of IκBε in finely tuning B-cell development and function."
"Stent graft devices for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are being increasingly used worldwide. Yet, during modelling and optimization of these devices, as well as in clinical practice, vascular sections are idealized, possibly compromising the effectiveness of the intervention. In this study, we challenge the commonly used approximation of the circular cross-section of the aorta and identify the implications of this approximation to the mechanical assessment of stent grafts. Using computed tomography angiography (CTA) data from 258 AAA patients, the lumen of the aneurysmal neck was analysed. The cross-section of the aortic neck was found to be an independent variable, uncorrelated to other geometrical aspects of the region, and its shape was non-circular reaching elliptical ratios as low as 0.77. These results were used to design a finite element analysis (FEA) study for the assessment of a ring stent bundle deployed under a variety of aortic cross-sections. Results showed that the most common clinical approximations of the vascular cross-section can be a source of significant error when calculating the maximum stent strains (underestimated by up to 69%) and radial forces (overestimated by up to 13%). Nevertheless, a less frequently used average approximation was shown to yield satisfactory results (5% and 2% of divergence respectively)."
"Excessive alcohol intake is associated with 5.9% of global deaths. However, this figure is especially acute in men such that 7.6% of deaths can be attributed to alcohol intake. Previous studies identified a significant interaction between genotypes of the galanin (GAL) gene with anxiety and alcohol abuse in different male populations but were unable to define a mechanism. To address these issues the current study analysed the human UK Biobank cohort and identified a significant interaction (n = 115,865; p = 0.0007) between allelic variation (GG or CA genotypes) in the highly conserved human GAL5.1 enhancer, alcohol intake (AUDIT questionnaire scores) and anxiety in men. Critically, disruption of GAL5.1 in mice using CRISPR genome editing significantly reduced GAL expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus whilst producing a corresponding reduction in ethanol intake in KO mice. Intriguingly, we also found the evidence of reduced anxiety-like behaviour in male GAL5.1KO animals mirroring that seen in humans from our UK Biobank studies. Using bioinformatic analysis and co-transfection studies we further identified the EGR1 transcription factor, that is co-expressed with GAL in amygdala and hypothalamus, as being important in the protein kinase C (PKC) supported activity of the GG genotype of GAL5.1 but less so in the CA genotype. Our unique study uses a novel combination of human association analysis, CRISPR genome editing in mice, animal behavioural analysis and cell culture studies to identify a highly conserved regulatory mechanism linking anxiety and alcohol intake that might contribute to increased susceptibility to anxiety and alcohol abuse in men."
"Triggering events for acute aortic dissections are incompletely understood. We sought to investigate whether there is an association between admission for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) to the University of Michigan Medical Center and the reported annual influenza activity by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. From 1996–2019 we had 758 patients admitted for ATAAD with 3.1 admissions per month during November-March and 2.5 admissions per month during April-October (p = 0.01). Influenza reporting data by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services became available in 2009. ATAAD admissions for the period 2009–2019 (n = 455) were 4.8 cases/month during peak influenza months compared to 3.5 cases/month during non-peak influenza months (p = 0.001). ATAAD patients admitted during influenza season had increased in-hospital mortality (11.0% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.024) and increased 30-day mortality (9.7 vs. 5.4%, p = 0.048). The results point to higher admission rates for ATAAD during months with above average influenza rates. Future studies need to investigate whether influenza virus infection affects susceptibility for aortic dissection, and whether this risk can be attenuated with the annual influenza vaccine in this patient population."
"The tannase-producing Gram-positive bacterial species Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen of the human gut and strongly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). A unique feature of Sgg is its ability to degrade tannic acids (TA). TA constitute an important part of the human diet with known anti-tumorigenic properties. Here, we examined whether Sgg is able to protect tumor cells from the toxic effect of TA and thus drive tumorigenesis indirectly. Human CRC cell lines (n = 8) were treated with increasing concentrations of TA. We confirmed the cytotoxic activity of TA in a dose-dependent manner. In virtually all cell lines, viability decreased significantly (>60% inhibition). Moreover, pyrogallol, the degradation product of TA, had no effect on the tested cell lines. This suggests a specific effect of TA. Cytotoxicity was due to necrosis and induction of senescence in residual cells. Finally, when TA was degraded by Sgg, the cytotoxic effect could be abolished. Tumor cells even responded with boosted cell proliferation, highlighting the impact of Sgg on CRC progression. We here provide another piece of evidence for the active interplay between Sgg and cancer preventive components. These data will help to move forward in designing concepts for therapeutic and eventually also prophylactic approaches to combat gastrointestinal malignancies."
"The accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) can be influenced by the increased glycolytic activity of inflammatory lesions. Here, using clinical data obtained from gynecological cancer patients, tumor samples and animal models, we investigate the impact of pretreatment tumor-related leukocytosis (TRL) on the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in detecting pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis. We demonstrate that pretreatment TRL misleads 18F-FDG-PET/CT during lymph node staging in gynecological malignancies. In the mechanistic investigations, we show that the false-positive 18F-FDG-PET/CT result for detecting nodal metastasis can be reproduced in animal models of TRL-positive cancer bearing G-CSF expressing cervical cancer cells. We also show that increased 18F-FDG uptake in non-metastatic nodes can be explained by the MDSC-mediated premetastatic niche formation in which proinflammatory factors, such as S100A8 or S100A9, are abundantly expressed. Together, our results suggest that the MDSC-mediated premetastatic niche created in the lymph node of TRL-positive patients misleads 18F-FDG-PET/CT for detecting nodal metastasis."
"Prolonged expression of the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease and gRNA from viral vectors may cause off-target mutagenesis and immunogenicity. Thus, a transient delivery system is needed for therapeutic genome editing applications. Here, we develop an extracellular nanovesicle-based ribonucleoprotein delivery system named NanoMEDIC by utilizing two distinct homing mechanisms. Chemical induced dimerization recruits Cas9 protein into extracellular nanovesicles, and then a viral RNA packaging signal and two self-cleaving riboswitches tether and release sgRNA into nanovesicles. We demonstrate efficient genome editing in various hard-to-transfect cell types, including human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, neurons, and myoblasts. NanoMEDIC also achieves over 90% exon skipping efficiencies in skeletal muscle cells derived from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient iPS cells. Finally, single intramuscular injection of NanoMEDIC induces permanent genomic exon skipping in a luciferase reporter mouse and in mdx mice, indicating its utility for in vivo genome editing therapy of DMD and beyond."
"Inconsistent evidence is found in the literature regarding the association between individuals’ stature and hypertension status. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the true association between height and occurrence of hypertension. For analysis purpose, this study considers Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2011 data obtained from an observational study. By dividing height (tall/normal/short) based on 25th and 75th percentile points separately for females and males, a binary logistic regression model was fitted to the weighted data, where weights were calculated from propensity scores (PS). From the PS-based weighted data, we did not find any significant association between height and hypertension (p > 0.05). Besides the respondent’s height, logistic regression analyses of a balanced data set have revolved around some well-known factors that are associated with the occurrence of hypertension: gender of the respondent, higher wealth index status, as well as overweight. This study also found higher odds of occurring hypertension among the residents of Khulna and Rangpur divisions, whereas lower likelihood of hypertension is reported for the individual living in Chittagong and Sylhet districts. The findings of this paper indicate that human stature is not a risk factor for hypertension. Apart from height, this study uncovers some important risk factors for developing hypertension. By considering these factors, awareness should be raised among male, wealthier, and overweighted individuals in Bangladesh. However, why the prevalence of hypertension is higher in Khulna and Rangpur, as well as lower in Chittagong and Sylhet, demands further research."
"We applied continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (CIONM) during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for left lung cancer and evaluated its safety and usefulness. An electrode was attached to a double-lumen tube, and placed at vocal cord level to detect the EMG signal evoked by vocal cord movement. Before 4 L lymph node dissection, an automatic periodic stimulation device was applied to the vagus nerve to stimulate vagus nerve continuously. Surgery was suspended if the amplitude decreased lower than the threshold and was resumed when the amplitude recovered. Ten patients (6 male, 4 female) were enrolled. CIONM was successfully performed in all patients without technical failure, and there was no hemodynamic instability. Amplitude decreased below the threshold in four patients. One patient did not recover amplitude and experienced transient vocal cord palsy. In the three other patients, the amplitude recovered above the threshold and no vocal cord palsy occurred. The six patients who did not exhibit amplitude decrease experienced no vocal cord palsy. Our results suggest that CIONM may be applied safely for VATS left lobectomy and may be used to predict postoperative vocal cord function. This approach may be helpful to prevent RLN injury during VATS left lobectomy."
"The relationship between amyloid-β (Aβ) species and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not fully understood. Here, we provide direct evidence that Aβ42/40 ratio, not total Aβ level, plays a critical role in inducing neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs) in human neurons. Using 3D-differentiated clonal human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) expressing varying levels of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) with AD mutations, we show that pathogenic tau accumulation and aggregation are tightly correlated with Aβ42/40 ratio. Roles of Aβ42/40 ratio on tau pathology are also confirmed with APP transmembrane domain (TMD) mutant hNPCs, which display differential Aβ42/40 ratios without mutant PS1. Moreover, naïve hNPCs co-cultured with APP TMD I45F (high Aβ42/40) cells, not with I47F cells (low Aβ42/40), develop robust tau pathology in a 3D non-cell autonomous cell culture system. These results emphasize the importance of reducing the Aβ42/40 ratio in AD therapy."
"We have treated 69 patients with steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD), with an anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody (Begelomab): 28 patients in two prospective studies (EudraCT No. 2007-005809-21; EudraCT No. 2012-001353-19), and 41 patients on a compassionate use study. The median age of patients was 42 and 44 years; the severity of GvHD was as follows: grade II in 8 patients, grade III in 33, and grade IV in 28 patients. There were no adverse events directly attributable to the antibody. Day 28 response was 75% in the prospective studies and 61% in the compassionate use patients, with complete response rates of 11 and 12%. Response for grade III GvHD was 83 and 73% in the two groups; response in grade IV GvHD was 66 and 56% in the two groups. Non relapse mortality (NRM) at 6 months was 28 and 38%. Overall there were 64, 56, 68% responses for skin, liver, and gut stage 3–4 GvHD. The overall survival at 1 year was 50% for the prospective studies and 33% for the compassionate use patients. In conclusion, Begelomab induces over 60% responses in SR-aGvHD, including patients with severe gut and liver GvHD, having failed one or more lines of treatment."
"Clostridium difficile is a leading causative agent of hospital-acquired and community-acquired diarrhea in human. This study aims to characterize the predominant C. difficile strains, RT001 and 126, circulating in Iranian hospitals in relation to resistant phenotypes, the antibiotic resistance genes, and their genetic relatedness. A total number of 735 faecal specimens were collected from patients suspected of CDI in Tehran hospitals. Typing and subtyping of the strains were performed using CE-PCR ribotyping and MLVA, respectively, followed by PCR assays for ARGs and indicators of Tns. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of five antibiotics were determined by MIC Test Strips. Among 65 strains recovered from CDI patients, RT001 (32.3%) and RT126 (9.2%) were found as the most frequent ribotypes, and 64 MLVA types were identified. Using MLVA, RT001 and RT126 were subtyped into 6 and 4 groups, respectively. The vanA, nim, tetM, gyrA, gyrB genes were detected in 24.6%, 0%, 89.2%, 95.3%, and 92.3% of the strains, respectively. The indicators of Tns including vanHAX, tndX, and int were found in 0%, 3% and 29.2% of the strains, respectively. The most common amino acid (AA) alterations of GyrA and GyrB were related to substitutions of Thr82 → Val and Ser366 → Val, respectively. Resistance rate to metronidazole, vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was 81.5%, 30.7%, 85%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. This study, for the first time revealed the subtypes of circulating RT001 and RT126 in Iran. It is of importance that the majority of the strains belonging to RT001 were multidrug resistant (MDR). This study also pointed to the intra-hospital dissemination of the strains belonging to RT001 and RT126 for short and long periods, respectively, using MLVA. The most important resistance phenotypes observed in this study was vancomycin-resistant phenotypes. Resistance to metronidazole was also high and highlights the need to determine its resistance mechanisms in the future studies."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common lung cancers worldwide. Accurate prognostic stratification of NSCLC can become an important clinical reference when designing therapeutic strategies for cancer patients. With this clinical application in mind, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) combining heterogeneous data sources of gene expression and clinical data to accurately predict the overall survival of NSCLC patients. Based on microarray data from a cohort set (614 patients), seven well-known NSCLC biomarkers were used to group patients into biomarker- and biomarker+ subgroups. Then, by using a systems biology approach, prognosis relevance values (PRV) were then calculated to select eight additional novel prognostic gene biomarkers. Finally, the combined 15 biomarkers along with clinical data were then used to develop an integrative DNN via bimodal learning to predict the 5-year survival status of NSCLC patients with tremendously high accuracy (AUC: 0.8163, accuracy: 75.44%). Using the capability of deep learning, we believe that our prediction can be a promising index that helps oncologists and physicians develop personalized therapy and build the foundation of precision medicine in the future."
"Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia has deleterious effects on the lung, provoking both inflammation and alveolar injury. The elements of hyperoxic injury, which result in high rates of lethality in experimental models, are thought to include multicellular immune responses. To characterize these alterations in immune cell populations, we performed time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis of CD45-expressing immune cells in whole lung parenchyma and the bronchoalveolar space of mice, exposed to 48 hours of hyperoxia together with normoxic controls. At the tested time point, hyperoxia exposure resulted in decreased abundance of immunoregulatory populations (regulatory B cells, myeloid regulatory cells) in lung parenchyma and markedly decreased proliferation rates of myeloid regulatory cells, monocytes and alveolar macrophages. Additionally, hyperoxia caused a shift in the phenotype of alveolar macrophages, increasing proportion of cells with elevated CD68, CD44, CD11c, PD-L1, and CD205 expression levels. These changes occurred in the absence of histologically evident alveolar damage and abundance of neutrophils in the parenchyma or alveolar space did not change at these time points. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that pulmonary response to hyperoxia involves marked changes in specific subsets of myeloid and lymphoid populations. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting in acute lung injury."
"Genetics has been one of the most powerful windows into the biology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is estimated that a thousand or more genes may confer risk for ASD when functionally perturbed, however, only around 100 genes currently have sufficient evidence to be considered true “autism risk genes”. Massive genetic studies are currently underway producing data to implicate additional genes. This approach — although necessary — is costly and slow-moving, making identification of putative ASD risk genes with existing data vital. Here, we approach autism risk gene discovery as a machine learning problem, rather than a genetic association problem, by using genome-scale data as predictors to identify new genes with similar properties to established autism risk genes. This ensemble method, forecASD, integrates brain gene expression, heterogeneous network data, and previous gene-level predictors of autism association into an ensemble classifier that yields a single score indexing evidence of each gene’s involvement in the etiology of autism. We demonstrate that forecASD has substantially better performance than previous predictors of autism association in three independent trio-based sequencing studies. Studying forecASD prioritized genes, we show that forecASD is a robust indicator of a gene’s involvement in ASD etiology, with diverse applications to gene discovery, differential expression analysis, eQTL prioritization, and pathway enrichment analysis."
"Hip shape is an important determinant of hip osteoarthritis (OA), which occurs more commonly in women. However, it remains unclear to what extent differences in OA prevalence are attributed to sex differences in hip shape. Here, we explore sex differences in proximal femur shape in a cohort of adolescents. Hip morphology was quantified using hip DXA scans from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Independent modes of variation (hip shape mode (HSM) scores) were generated for each image using an adult reference statistical shape model (N = 19,379). Linear regression was used to examine sex differences for the top ten HSMs, adjusting for age, height, lean and fat mass. Complete outcome and covariate data were available for 4,428 and 4,369 participants at ages 14 and 18 years, respectively. Several HSMs showed sex differences at both time points. The combined effect of sex on hip shape at age 14 reflected flatter femoral head and smaller lesser trochanter in females compared with males and, following adjustment for age and body size, these differences became more pronounced. At age 18, smaller lesser trochanter and femoral neck width (FNW) in females still remained although differences in femoral head, femoral shaft and FNW were largely attenuated following adjustment. Sexual dimorphism in proximal femur shape can be discerned in adolescence and early adulthood. Observed differences in proximal femur shape, particularly at age 14 were largely independent of body size, however to what extent differences in hip shape in early life play a role in predisposing to hip OA in later life remains to be determined."
"BackgroundIntervention studies suggest an influence of breakfast dietary glycemic index (GI) on children’s cognition. The Cognition Intervention Study Dortmund-GI-I study examined whether lunch dietary GI might have short-term effects on selected cognitive parameters.MethodsA randomized crossover study was performed at a comprehensive school on 2 test days. One hundred and eighty-nine participants (5th and 6th grade) were randomly assigned to one of the two sequences, medium-high GI (m-hGI) or high-medium GI (h-mGI), following block randomization. In the first period, one group received a dish containing hGI rice (GI: 86) ad libitum, the other mGI rice (GI: 62)—1 week later, in the second period, vice versa. Tonic alertness, task switching, and working memory updating were tested with a computerized test battery 45 min after beginning of lunch break. Treatment effects were estimated using the t test for normally distributed data or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normally distributed data.ResultsThe crossover approach revealed no effects of lunch dietary GI on the tested cognitive parameters in the early afternoon. However, we determined carryover effects for two parameters, and therefore analyzed only data of the first period. The reaction time of the two-back task (working memory updating) was faster (p = 0.001) and the count of commission errors in the alertness task was lower (p = 0.04) in the hGI group.ConclusionNo evidence of short-term effects of lunch dietary GI on cognition of schoolchildren was found. Potential positive effects on single parameters of working memory updating and tonic alertness favoring hGI rice need to be verified."
"The underlying mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) participating in the progression of lung cancers are largely unknown. We found a novel lncRNA, PIK3CD antisense RNA 2 (PIK3CD-AS2), that contributes to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression. The expression characteristics of PIK3CD-AS2 in LUAD were analyzed using microarray expression profile, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, and validated in 92 paired LUAD tissues by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Our data confirmed that PIK3CD-AS2 expression is a crucial regulator of LUAD progression and associated with shorter patient survival. In vitro studies showed that PIK3CD-AS2 increased cell growth and slowed apoptosis in p53wt cells but not in p53null cells. Mechanically, it is demonstrated that PIK3CD-AS2 bound to and maintained the stability of Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), a potent destabilizer of p53, by impeding its ubiquitination and degradation. Downexpression of YBX1 reversed PIK3CD-AS2-mediated inhibition of p53 signaling. Additionally, the therapeutic effect evaluation of a locked nuclear acid (LNA) specifically targeting PIK3CD-AS2 showed an anti-tumor activity in mice with A549 cells xenograft and p53 wild-type LUAD patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model. Clinically, the high expression of PIK3CD-AS2 showed a poor disease-free survival in p53 wild-type patients in TCGA database. Our findings suggest that PIK3CD-AS2 regulates LUAD progression and elucidate a new PIK3CD-AS2/YBX1/p53 signaling axis, providing a potential lncRNA-directed therapeutic strategy especially in p53 wild-type LUAD patients."
"The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of sleep quality and time with basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fuel oxidation in basal conditions and during exercise in sedentary middle-aged adults. We also studied the mediation role of dietary intake and adherence to the traditional Mediterranean Diet in the relationship between sleep parameters and energy metabolism parameters.A secondary analysis of the FIT-AGEING study was undertaken. 70 middle-aged sedentary adults (40–65 years old) participated in the present study. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and wrist accelerometers (ActiSleep, Actigraph, Pensacola, Florida, USA) for 7 consecutive days. BMR was measured with indirect calorimetry and fuel oxidation was estimated through stoichiometric equations. Maximal fat oxidation was determined by a walking graded exercise test and dietary intake with 24 h recalls. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed through the PREDIMED questionnaire. PSQI global score (poor sleep quality) was associated with lower basal fat oxidation (BFox), both expressed in g/min and as a percentage of BMR, independently of confounders. We did not find any association between other sleep and energy metabolism parameters. No mediating role of the dietary intake or PREDIMED global score was observed in the association of PSQI and BFox. In conclusion, our study showed that a subjective poor sleep quality was associated with lower BFox, which is not mediated by dietary intake in sedentary adults."
"Adult-type granulosa cell tumor (aGCT) is a rare malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor, harboring recurrent FOXL2 c.C402G/p.C134W hotspot mutations in 97% of cases. These tumors are considered to have a favorable prognosis, however aGCTs have a tendency for local spread and late recurrences, which are associated with poor survival rates. We sought to determine the genetic alterations associated with aGCT disease progression. We subjected primary non-recurrent aGCTs (n = 7), primary aGCTs that subsequently recurred (n = 9) and their matched recurrences (n = 9), and aGCT recurrences without matched primary tumors (n = 10) to targeted massively parallel sequencing of ≥410 cancer-related genes. In addition, three primary non-recurrent aGCTs and nine aGCT recurrences were subjected to FOXL2 and TERT promoter Sanger sequencing analysis. All aGCTs harbored the FOXL2 C134W hotspot mutation. TERT promoter mutations were found to be significantly more frequent in recurrent (18/28, 64%) than primary aGCTs (5/19, 26%, p = 0.017). In addition, mutations affecting TP53, MED12, and TET2 were restricted to aGCT recurrences. Pathway annotation of altered genes demonstrated that aGCT recurrences displayed an enrichment for genetic alterations affecting cell cycle pathway-related genes. Analysis of paired primary and recurrent aGCTs revealed that TERT promoter mutations were either present in both primary tumors and matched recurrences or were restricted to the recurrence and absent in the respective primary aGCT. Clonal composition analysis of these paired samples further revealed that aGCTs display intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity and harbor multiple clones at diagnosis and relapse. We observed that in a subset of cases, recurrences acquired additional genetic alterations not present in primary aGCTs, including TERT, MED12, and TP53 mutations and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletions. Albeit harboring relatively simple genomes, our data provide evidence to suggest that aGCTs are genetically heterogeneous tumors and that TERT promoter mutations and/or genetic alterations affecting other cell cycle-related genes may be associated with disease progression and recurrences."
"Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a serious condition; many survivors develop neurological impairments, including cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. Preclinical studies show that the systemic administration of umbilical cord blood cells (UCBCs) is beneficial for neonatal HIE. We conducted a single-arm clinical study to examine the feasibility and safety of intravenous infusion of autologous UCBCs for newborns with HIE. When a neonate was born with severe asphyxia, the UCB was collected, volume-reduced, and divided into three doses. The processed UCB was infused at 12–24, 36–48, and 60–72 hours after the birth. The designed enrolment was six newborns. All six newborns received UCBC therapy strictly adhering to the study protocol together with therapeutic hypothermia. The physiological parameters and peripheral blood parameters did not change much between pre- and postinfusion. There were no serious adverse events that might be related to cell therapy. At 30 days of age, the six infants survived without circulatory or respiratory support. At 18 months of age, neurofunctional development was normal without any impairment in four infants and delayed with cerebral palsy in two infants. This pilot study shows that autologous UCBC therapy is feasible and safe."
"For oral, oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancer, the early detection of tumours and of residual tumour after surgery are prognostic factors of recurrence rates and patient survival. Here, we report the validation, in animal models and a human, of the use of a previously described fluorescently labelled small-molecule inhibitor of the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) for the detection of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus. We show that the fluorescent contrast agent can be used to quantify the expression levels of PARP1 and to detect oral, oropharyngeal and oesophageal tumours in mice, pigs and fresh human biospecimens when delivered topically or intravenously. The fluorescent PARP1 inhibitor can also detect oral carcinoma in a patient when applied as a mouthwash, and discriminate between fresh biopsied samples of the oral tumour and the surgical resection margin with more than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The PARP1 inhibitor could serve as the basis of a rapid and sensitive assay for the early detection and for the surgical-margin assessment of epithelial cancers of the upper intestinal tract."
"BackgroundXentuzumab, an insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1/IGF-2-neutralising antibody, binds IGF-1 and IGF-2, inhibiting their growth-promoting signalling. Two first-in-human trials assessed the maximum-tolerated/relevant biological dose (MTD/RBD), safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and activity of xentuzumab in advanced/metastatic solid cancers.MethodsThese phase 1, open-label trials comprised dose-finding (part I; 3 + 3 design) and expansion cohorts (part II; selected tumours; RBD [weekly dosing]). Primary endpoints were MTD/RBD.ResultsStudy 1280.1 involved 61 patients (part I: xentuzumab 10–1800 mg weekly, n = 48; part II: 1000 mg weekly, n = 13); study 1280.2, 64 patients (part I: 10–3600 mg three-weekly, n = 33; part II: 1000 mg weekly, n = 31). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred; the MTD was not reached for either schedule. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2, mostly gastrointestinal. Xentuzumab showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. Total plasma IGF-1 increased dose dependently, plateauing at ~1000 mg/week; at ≥450 mg/week, IGF bioactivity was almost undetectable. Two partial responses occurred (poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour). Integration of biomarker and response data by Bayesian Logistic Regression Modeling (BLRM) confirmed the RBD.ConclusionsXentuzumab was well tolerated; MTD was not reached. RBD was 1000 mg weekly, confirmed by BLRM. Xentuzumab showed preliminary anti-tumour activity.Clinical trial registrationNCT01403974; NCT01317420."
"Fatty acids are the most major substrate source for adult cardiac energy generation. Prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a highly conserved protein located in mitochondrial inner membrane, plays key roles in cellular energy metabolic homeostasis. However, its functions in regulating cardiac fatty acid metabolism have remained largely unknown. Our study demonstrates that cardiac-specific knockout of Phb2 leads to accumulation of lipid droplets and causes heart failure. Mechanistically, ablation of PHB2 impairs cardiac fatty acid oxidation (FAO) through downregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase1b (CPT1b), a rate-limiting enzyme of cardiac mitochondrial FAO. Moreover, overexpression of CPT1b alleviates impaired FAO in PHB2-deficient cardiomyocytes. Thus, our study provides direct evidence for the link between PHB2 and cardiac fatty acid metabolism. Our study points out that PHB2 is a potential FAO regulator in cardiac mitochondrial inner membrane, as well as the connection between PHB2 and CPT1b and their relationships to cardiac pathology especially to cardiac fatty acid metabolic disorder."
"Retinal fundus images are used to detect organ damage from vascular diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus and hypertension) and screen ocular diseases. We aimed to assess convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict age and sex from retinal fundus images in normal participants and in participants with underlying systemic vascular-altered status. In addition, we also tried to investigate clues regarding differences between normal ageing and vascular pathologic changes using the CNN models. In this study, we developed CNN age and sex prediction models using 219,302 fundus images from normal participants without hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and any smoking history. The trained models were assessed in four test-sets with 24,366 images from normal participants, 40,659 images from hypertension participants, 14,189 images from DM participants, and 113,510 images from smokers. The CNN model accurately predicted age in normal participants; the correlation between predicted age and chronologic age was R2 = 0.92, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was 3.06 years. MAEs in test-sets with hypertension (3.46 years), DM (3.55 years), and smoking (2.65 years) were similar to that of normal participants; however, R2 values were relatively low (hypertension, R2 = 0.74; DM, R2 = 0.75; smoking, R2 = 0.86). In subgroups with participants over 60 years, the MAEs increased to above 4.0 years and the accuracies declined for all test-sets. Fundus-predicted sex demonstrated acceptable accuracy (area under curve > 0.96) in all test-sets. Retinal fundus images from participants with underlying vascular-altered conditions (hypertension, DM, or smoking) indicated similar MAEs and low coefficients of determination (R2) between the predicted age and chronologic age, thus suggesting that the ageing process and pathologic vascular changes exhibit different features. Our models demonstrate the most improved performance yet and provided clues to the relationship and difference between ageing and pathologic changes from underlying systemic vascular conditions. In the process of fundus change, systemic vascular diseases are thought to have a different effect from ageing. Research in context. Evidence before this study. The human retina and optic disc continuously change with ageing, and they share physiologic or pathologic characteristics with brain and systemic vascular status. As retinal fundus images provide high-resolution in-vivo images of retinal vessels and parenchyma without any invasive procedure, it has been used to screen ocular diseases and has attracted significant attention as a predictive biomarker for cerebral and systemic vascular diseases. Recently, deep neural networks have revolutionised the field of medical image analysis including retinal fundus images and shown reliable results in predicting age, sex, and presence of cardiovascular diseases. Added value of this study. This is the first study demonstrating how a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using retinal fundus images from normal participants measures the age of participants with underlying vascular conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), or history of smoking using a large database, SBRIA, which contains 412,026 retinal fundus images from 155,449 participants. Our results indicated that the model accurately predicted age in normal participants, while correlations (coefficient of determination, R2) in test-sets with hypertension, DM, and smoking were relatively low. Additionally, a subgroup analysis indicated that mean absolute errors (MAEs) increased and accuracies declined significantly in subgroups with participants over 60 years of age in both normal participants and participants with vascular-altered conditions. These results suggest that pathologic retinal vascular changes occurring in systemic vascular diseases are different form the changes in spontaneous ageing process, and the ageing process observed in retinal fundus images may saturate at age about 60 years. Implications of all available evidence. Based on this study and previous reports, the CNN could accurately and reliably predict age and sex using retinal fundus images. The fact that retinal changes caused by ageing and systemic vascular diseases occur differently motivates one to understand the retina deeper. Deep learning-based fundus image reading may be a more useful and beneficial tool for screening and diagnosing systemic and ocular diseases after further development."
"Post-weaning diarrhea commonly occurs in piglets and results in significant economic loss to swine producers. Non-antibiotic measures for managing post-weaning diarrhea are critically needed. Duan-Nai-An, a probiotic produced from the yeast fermentation of egg whites, was previously shown to optimize intestinal flora and reduce the incidence of clinical diarrhea in weaning piglets. To study the effects of Duan-Nai-An on mucosal integrity and immunity in pig intestine, we examined the microstructure and ultrastructure of the intestines of weaned pigs with or without Duan-Nai-An as a feed supplement. The piglets of the Duan-Nai-An-fed group developed intestines with intact columnar epithelia covered by tightly packed microvilli on the apical surface. However, piglets of the control group (no supplement) showed villous atrophy and thinning, microvillus slough, and in the severe cases, damage of intestinal epithelia and exposure of the underlying lamina propria. Moreover, piglets of the Duan-Nai-An-fed group showed apparent plasmocyte hyperplasia, increased lymphoid nodule numbers, well-developed Peyer’s Patchs, and apparent germinal centers. The lymphoid tissues of the control group were far less developed, showing lymph node atrophy, lymphocyte reduction, degeneration, and necrosis. These results indicate that Duan-Nai-An improves the development of the intestinal structures and lymphoid tissues and promotes intestinal health in weaned piglets."
"Pinellia (Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit.), as important medicinal plant, has been used to treat various ailments for a long time. The sixteen ploid plant (2n = 16 * 13 = 208) Pinellia T2Plus line was obtained from an octoploid (2n = 8 * 13 = 104) T2 line by chromosome-doubling technique. Compared with T2 line, the content of various medicinal components (polysaccharide, guanosine, adenosine and ephedrine) was increased in T2Plus line. In this study, the transcriptome of T2 line and T2Plus line were characterized by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis on differential expressed unigenes (DEGs) revealed that multiple metabolic pathway were enriched significantly, such as ‘Starch and sucrose metabolism’, ‘Purine metabolism’, ‘Photosynthesis’ and six transcription factors (MYB, WRKY, bHLH, lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD), homeodomain-zipper (HD-ZIP) and Ethylene-responsive factor (ERF)) play a key role in difference of transcriptome between T2 line and T2Plus line. These metabolic pathways and transcription factors may play an important role in the difference of medicinal components and epigenetic features between these two Pinellia cultivars. This conclusion provides a robust theoretical basis for the mechanism of the formation of medicinal ingredients in Pinellia cultivars."
"INSM1 is a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors originating in multiple anatomic sites. In the lung, INSM1 shows 76–97% sensitivity for neuroendocrine tumors overall. Our aim was to characterize INSM1 as a diagnostic marker for small cell carcinoma in the context of its epithelial, lymphoid, and mesenchymal morphologic mimics. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 231 tumors, including lung neuroendocrine tumors, nonneuroendocrine carcinomas of the thoracic cavity, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and small round cell sarcomas, using an anti-INSM1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Extent (0–100%) and intensity (1–3+) of nuclear INSM1 staining was multiplied in each case to calculate an H-score. Demographic and clinical information was obtained from the medical record. INSM1 had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 82.7% for small cell carcinoma, respectively, using a threshold established with a receiver operating characteristic curve. 40/48 (82.7%) small cell carcinomas were positive for INSM1, including 19/24 (79%) small cell carcinomas that were negative for chromogranin and synaptophysin. 5/5 carcinoids and 21/28 (75%) large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas showed INSM1 expression. Among nonneuroendocrine tumors, 7/38 (18%) lung adenocarcinomas, 2/17 (12%) lung squamous cell carcinomas, 4/10 (40%) thymic carcinomas, 4/12 (33%) adenoid cystic carcinomas, 1/19 (5%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 4/11 (36%) alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and 4/23 (17%) Ewing sarcomas were positive for INSM1. No synovial sarcomas or desmoplastic small round cell tumors were positive. Weak, focal INSM1 expression alone is insufficient as a diagnostic marker for small cell carcinoma, but is sensitive and specific, easy to interpret in small biopsies, and makes a valuable addition to a diagnostic panel."
"Forecasting healthcare utilization has the potential to anticipate care needs, either accelerating needed care or redirecting patients toward care most appropriate to their needs. While prior research has utilized clinical information to forecast readmissions, analyzing digital footprints from social media can inform our understanding of individuals’ behaviors, thoughts, and motivations preceding a healthcare visit. We evaluate how language patterns on social media change prior to emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient hospital admissions in this case-crossover study of adult patients visiting a large urban academic hospital system who consented to share access to their history of Facebook statuses and electronic medical records. An ensemble machine learning model forecasted ED visits and inpatient admissions with out-of-sample cross-validated AUCs of 0.64 and 0.70 respectively. Prior to an ED visit, there was a significant increase in depressed language (Cohen’s d = 0.238), and a decrease in informal language (d = 0.345). Facebook posts prior to an inpatient admission showed significant increase in expressions of somatic pain (d = 0.267) and decrease in extraverted/social language (d = 0.357). These results are a first step in developing methods to utilize user-generated content to characterize patient care-seeking context which could ultimately enable better allocation of resources and potentially early interventions to reduce unplanned visits."
"Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is one of the most commonly identified inner ear malformations in hearing loss patients including Pendred syndrome. While biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene, encoding pendrin, causes non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA or Pendred syndrome, a considerable number of patients appear to carry mono-allelic mutation. This suggests faulty pendrin regulatory machinery results in hearing loss. Here we identify EPHA2 as another causative gene of Pendred syndrome with SLC26A4. EphA2 forms a protein complex with pendrin controlling pendrin localization, which is disrupted in some pathogenic forms of pendrin. Moreover, point mutations leading to amino acid substitution in the EPHA2 gene are identified from patients bearing mono-allelic mutation of SLC26A4. Ephrin-B2 binds to EphA2 triggering internalization with pendrin inducing EphA2 autophosphorylation weakly. The identified EphA2 mutants attenuate ephrin-B2- but not ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 internalization with pendrin. Our results uncover an unexpected role of the Eph/ephrin system in epithelial function."
"Antibodies of the IgG class to terminal Galα3Gal (IgG anti-αGal) is abundant in human plasma and are reported to bind most sepsis-causing Gram-negative bacteria. However, these seminal findings, made more than two decades ago, have not been reexamined. Our aim was to assess IgG anti-αGal´s pathogen reactivity. We affinity purified IgG anti-αGal from a therapeutic grade normal human IgG pool applying two rounds of positive selection with Galα3Gal-coupled beads and included removal of column matrix reactive antibodies. The purified antibodies were rigorously characterized in terms of specificity and purity in various solid-phase immunoassays. We used flow cytometry to study reactivity against 100 consecutive clinical isolates diagnosed as cause of sepsis in humans. We found that the purified IgG anti-αGal displays high specificity for Galα3Gal. Also, IgG anti-αGal at 5 mg/L bound 56 out of 100 pathogens with predilection for Gram-positive bacteria binding 39 out of 52 strains. We confirm that although IgG anti-αGal comprise a small fraction of the human antibody pool (~0.1%), these antibodies targets an impressively large part of pathogens causing invasive disease."
"Mindfulness and meditation techniques have proven successful for the reduction of stress and improvement in general health. In addition, meditation is linked to longevity and longer telomere length, a proposed biomarker of human aging. Interestingly, DNA methylation changes have been described at specific subtelomeric regions in long-term meditators compared to controls. However, the molecular basis underlying these beneficial effects of meditation on human health still remains unclear. Here we show that DNA methylation levels, measured by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) array, at specific subtelomeric regions containing GPR31 and SERPINB9 genes were associated with telomere length in long-term meditators with a strong statistical trend when correcting for multiple testing. Notably, age showed no association with telomere length in the group of long-term meditators. These results may suggest that long-term meditation could be related to epigenetic mechanisms, in particular gene-specific DNA methylation changes at distinct subtelomeric regions."
"We investigated the prevalence of retinal vascular occlusion and intraocular bleeding and compare their risks in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy, either with non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or warfarin. We performed a cohort study (January 2015 to April 2018) in 281,970 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) using health claims in the nationwide database of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment service of Korea. A Cox-proportional hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for retinal vascular occlusion or intraocular bleeding. The HR of retinal vascular occlusion was estimated to 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35–1.86) for NOAC users compared to that with warfarin users. Among the various types of NOACs, all NOACs showed higher risk of retinal vascular occlusion than did warfarin. For intraocular bleeding, the HR was estimated to be 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75–0.98) for NOAC users compared with that with warfarin users. The risk of retinal vascular occlusion was higher in NOAC users than in warfarin users, while the risk of intraocular bleeding was lower with NOAC therapy. NOACs were not found to be as effective as warfarin for retinal vascular occlusion, but safe in terms of intraocular bleeding."
"The global burden of disease attributable to externalizing disorders such as alcohol misuse calls urgently for effective prevention and intervention. As our current knowledge is mainly derived from high-income countries such in Europe and North-America, it is difficult to address the wider socio-cultural, psychosocial context, and genetic factors in which risk and resilience are embedded in low- and medium-income countries. c-VEDA was established as the first and largest India-based multi-site cohort investigating the vulnerabilities for the development of externalizing disorders, addictions, and other mental health problems. Using a harmonised data collection plan coordinated with multiple cohorts in China, USA, and Europe, baseline data were collected from seven study sites between November 2016 and May 2019. Nine thousand and ten participants between the ages of 6 and 23 were assessed during this time, amongst which 1278 participants underwent more intensive assessments including MRI scans. Both waves of follow-ups have started according to the accelerated cohort structure with planned missingness design. Here, we present descriptive statistics on several key domains of assessments, and the full baseline dataset will be made accessible for researchers outside the consortium in September 2019. More details can be found on our website [cveda.org]."
"Previous studies have demonstrated effects of racial and socioeconomic factors on survival of adults with cancer. While less studied in the pediatric population, data exist demonstrating disparities of care and survival in pediatric oncology patients based on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic factors. Brain cancers recently overtook leukemia as the number one cause of childhood cancer fatalities, but demographic and socioeconomic disparities in these tumors have not been adequately studied. We obtained data from the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We selected patients under 19 years of age with central nervous system (CNS) cancers diagnosed between 2000 and 2015. We included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and socioeconomic characteristics as covariates in the analysis. We measured overall survival and extent of disease at diagnosis. We saw that Black and Hispanic patients overall had a higher risk of death than non-Hispanic White patients on multivariable analysis. On stratified analysis, Black and Hispanic patients with both metastatic and localized disease at diagnosis had a higher risk of death compared to White, non-Hispanic patients, although the difference in Black patients was not significant after adjusting for mediating factors. However, our findings on extent of disease at diagnosis demonstrated that neither Black race nor Hispanic ethnicity increased the chance of metastatic disease at presentation when controlling for mediating variables. In summary, racial and ethnic disparities in childhood CNS tumor survival appear to have their roots at least partially in post-diagnosis factors, potentially due to the lack of access to high quality care, leading to poorer overall outcomes."
"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder and is caused by CGG repeat expansion in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein. This event leads to gene silencing and the loss of gene products through DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. Due to the pathogenesis of FXS, targeted, symptomatic, and etiological approaches have been developed for its treatment. Despite their rapid development, symptomatic and targeted treatment approaches have numerous limitations; etiological approaches have the greatest potential because they affect the main causes of transcriptional silencing. In this review, we consider three potential etiological therapeutic methods that affect the reactivation of FMR1 gene expression: treatment with inhibitors of chromatin-modifying enzymes, the use of noncoding RNAs and the application of gene therapy. Inhibitors of chromatin-modifying enzymes are not clinically applicable because of their low reactivity and high cytotoxicity, and noncoding RNAs are currently only under study. Thus, we discuss gene therapy as the most promising approach for treating FXS in the near future."
"Breast cancer (BC) is a common cancer in women worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, up to 30% of women eventually relapse and die of metastatic breast cancer. Liquid biopsy analysis of circulating cell-free DNA fragments in the patients’ blood can monitor clonality and evolving mutations as a surrogate for tumour biopsy. Next generation sequencing platforms and digital droplet PCR can be used to profile circulating tumour DNA from liquid biopsies; however, they are expensive and time consuming for clinical use. Here, we report a novel strategy with proof-of-concept data that supports the usage of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect PIK3CA c.3140 A > G (H1047R), a prevalent BC missense mutation that is attributed to BC tumour growth. Allele-specific primers were designed and optimized to detect the p.H1047R variant following the USS-sbLAMP method. The assay was developed with synthetic DNA templates and validated with DNA from two breast cancer cell-lines and two patient tumour tissue samples through a qPCR instrument and finally piloted on an ISFET enabled microchip. This work sets a foundation for BC mutational profiling on a Lab-on-Chip device, to help the early detection of patient relapse and to monitor efficacy of systemic therapies for personalised cancer patient management."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease linked to oxidative stress, which is associated with significant morbidity. The NADPH oxidase complex (NOX) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are among the key markers for determining RA’s pathophysiology. Therefore, understanding ROS-regulated molecular pathways and their interaction is necessary for developing novel therapeutic approaches for RA. Here, by combining mouse genetics and biochemistry with clinical tissue analysis, we reveal that in vivo Rubicon interacts with the p22phox subunit of NOX, which is necessary for increased ROS-mediated RA pathogenesis. Furthermore, we developed a series of new aryl propanamide derivatives consisting of tetrahydroindazole and thiadiazole as p22phox inhibitors and selected 2-(tetrahydroindazolyl)phenoxy-N-(thiadiazolyl)propanamide 2 (TIPTP, M.W. 437.44), which showed considerably improved potency, reaching an IC50 value up to 100-fold lower than an inhibitor that we previously synthesized reported N8 peptide-mimetic small molecule (blocking p22phox–Rubicon interaction). Notably, TIPTP treatment showed significant therapeutic effects a mouse model for RA. Furthermore, TIPTP had anti-inflammatory effects ex vivo in monocytes from healthy individuals and synovial fluid cells from RA patients. These findings may have clinical applications for the development of TIPTP as a small molecule inhibitor of the p22phox-Rubicon axis for the treatment of ROS-driven diseases such as RA."
"Ketamine has shown promising antidepressant efficacy for adolescent treatment-resistant depression. However, the potential enduring consequences of ketamine exposure have not been thoroughly evaluated. Thus, we examined if juvenile ketamine treatment results in long-lasting changes for the rewarding properties of sucrose and cocaine in adulthood, across three separate experiments. In Experiment 1, adolescent male and female C57BL/6 mice received ketamine (20 mg/kg) for 15 consecutive days (Postnatal Day [PD] 35–49). Twenty-one days later (PD70; adulthood) we examined their behavioral responsivity to sucrose (1%) on a two-bottle choice design, or cocaine (0, 5, 10 mg/kg) using the conditioned place preference (CPP) test. We found that juvenile ketamine-pretreatment increased preference for sucrose and environments paired with cocaine in male, but not female, adult mice. This long-term outcome was not observed when male and female mice received ketamine as adults (PD70-84) and tested for sucrose and cocaine preference 21-days later (Experiment 2). Similarly, in Experiment 3, no long-lasting differences in these measures were observed when adolescent male mice were exposed to concomitant ketamine and social stressors (PD35-44), namely the social defeat or vicarious defeat stress paradigms—procedures that mediated a depression-related phenotype (along with a ketamine antidepressant-like response). Collectively, we demonstrate that in the absence of physical or psychological stress, adolescent ketamine exposure increases later life preference for the rewarding properties of sucrose and cocaine in a sex- and age-specific manner. As such, this preclinical work provides awareness for the potential long-term behavioral consequences associated with juvenile ketamine exposure."
"The monitoring of vascular-targeted therapies using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography or ultrasound is limited by their insufficient spatial resolution. Here, by taking advantage of the intrinsic optical properties of haemoglobin, we show that raster-scanning optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) provides high-resolution images of the tumour vasculature and of the surrounding tissue, and that the detection of a wide range of ultrasound bandwidths enables the distinction of vessels of differing size, providing detailed insights into the vascular responses to vascular-targeted therapy. Using RSOM to examine the responses to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy in mice with subcutaneous xenografts, we observed a substantial and immediate occlusion of the tumour vessels followed by haemorrhage within the tissue and the eventual collapse of the entire vasculature. Using dual-wavelength RSOM, which distinguishes oxyhaemoglobin from deoxyhaemoglobin, we observed an increase in oxygenation of the entire tumour volume immediately after the application of the therapy, and a second wave of oxygen reperfusion approximately 24 h thereafter. We also show that RSOM enables the quantification of differences in neoangiogenesis that predict treatment efficacy."
"The presence of bronchial mucus plugs (BMP) in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) results in delayed clinical and radiographic resolution and long-standing pulmonary sequelae. The predictive factors associated with BMP formation remains poorly defined. Nomograms to predict BMP presence in children with MPP were proposed using a cohort of patients who underwent bronchoscopy intervention at Children’s Hospital in Eastern China. Patients with MPP in an earlier period formed the training cohort (n = 872) for nomogram development, and those thereafter formed the validation cohort (n = 399) to confirmed model’s performance. BMP in children with MPP were found in 196 (22.5%) and 91(22.8%) patients in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The independent risk factors associated with BMP were age >5years (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.43 to 2.98), higher IL-10 level (>10 ng/L, 2.19; 95% CI 1.46 to 3.28), higher IFN-γ level (>30 ng/L, 1.69; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.54), and presence of complication (3.43; 95% CI 1.45 to 8.09). Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.771(95% CI, 0.734–0.808) and 0.796 (95% CI, 0.744–0.848) in predicting BMP in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram achieved an optimal prediction of BMP in children with MPP. Using this model, the risk of BMP formation would be determined, contributing to a rational therapeutic choice."
"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS; also designated as acne inversa) is a chronic inflammatory disorder, which affects the intertriginous skin and is associated with numerous systemic comorbidities. The estimated prevalence of HS is ~1% in most studied countries. Typically starting in early adulthood, cutaneous inflamed nodules, abscesses and pus-discharging tunnels develop in axillary, inguinal, gluteal and perianal body sites. The comorbidities of HS include metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, which contribute to reduced life expectancy. A genetic predisposition, smoking, obesity and hormonal factors are established aetiological factors for HS. Cutaneous changes seem to start around hair follicles and involve activation of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, with pivotal roles for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor, IL-1β and IL-17. The unrestricted and chronic immune response eventually leads to severe pain, pus discharge, irreversible tissue destruction and scar development. HS has profound negative effects on patients’ quality of life, which often culminate in social withdrawal, unemployment, depression and suicidal thoughts. The therapeutic options for HS comprise antibiotic treatment, neutralization of tumour necrosis factor and surgical intervention together with lifestyle modification. Nevertheless, there is an enormous need for awareness of HS, understanding of its pathogenesis and novel treatments."
"Rectal cancer treatment has evolved during the past 40 years with the use of a standardized surgical technique for tumour resection: total mesorectal excision. A dramatic reduction in local recurrence rates and improved survival outcomes have been achieved as consequences of a better understanding of the surgical oncology of rectal cancer, and the advent of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments to compliment surgery have paved the way for a multidisciplinary approach to disease management. Further improvements in imaging techniques and the ability to identify prognostic factors such as tumour regression, extramural venous invasion and threatened margins have introduced the concept of decision-making based on preoperative staging information. Modern treatment strategies are underpinned by accurate high-resolution imaging guiding both neoadjuvant therapy and precision surgery, followed by meticulous pathological scrutiny identifying the important prognostic factors for adjuvant chemotherapy. Included in these strategies are organ-sparing approaches and watch-and-wait strategies in selected patients. These pathways rely on the close working of interlinked disciplines within a multidisciplinary team. Such multidisciplinary forums are becoming standard in the treatment of rectal cancer across the UK, Europe and, more recently, the USA. This Review examines the essential components of modern-day management of rectal cancer through a multidisciplinary team approach, providing information that is essential for any practising colorectal surgeon to guide the best patient care."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. One common factor that may affect CVD risk factors is sleep disturbance. The factors influencing an individual’s sleep may vary among different cultures. The current study investigated sleep quality and quantity in the Fasa cohort population as an Iranian population. In a cross-sectional study using the Fasa PERSIAN cohort study data, 10,129 subjects aged 35–70 were entered. Self-reported sleep duration and cardiovascular events were recorded. The Framingham risk score (FRS) is used to predict cardiovascular events. Adjusted logistic regression showed significant odds ratios in subjects who sleep less than 6 hours for CVD (OR = 1.23; 95% CI:1.03–1.48), coronary heart disease (CHD) (OR = 1.21; 95% CI:1.009–1.46), and hypertension (HTN) (OR = 1.37; 95% CI:1.16–1.62). Higher risk profiles were also seen in the FRS for short sleepers. The highest significant odds ratios in FRS profiles in the intermediate high-risk group compared with the low-risk group were (1.44; 95% CI:1.18–1.75) in CVD and (1.48; 95% CI:1.16–1.88) in CHD risk score profiles. It can be suggested that participants with short durations of sleep had significantly higher CVD, HTN prevalence, and 10-year FRS. Participants with long sleep durations had no increase in CVD, CHD, myocardial infarction (MI), or HTN prevalence. MI prevalence was at the lowest level in subjects who got 8 to 8.9 hours of sleep."
"Persistent protein obstacles on genomic DNA, such as DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) and tight nucleoprotein complexes, can block replication forks. DPCs can be removed by the proteolytic activities of the metalloprotease SPRTN or the proteasome in a replication-coupled manner; however, additional proteolytic mechanisms may exist to cope with the diversity of protein obstacles. Here, we show that FAM111A, a PCNA-interacting protein, plays an important role in mitigating the effect of protein obstacles on replication forks. This function of FAM111A requires an intact trypsin-like protease domain, the PCNA interaction, and the DNA-binding domain that is necessary for protease activity in vivo. FAM111A, but not SPRTN, protects replication forks from stalling at poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-DNA complexes trapped by PARP inhibitors, thereby promoting cell survival after drug treatment. Altogether, our findings reveal a role of FAM111A in overcoming protein obstacles to replication forks, shedding light on cellular responses to anti-cancer therapies."
"Cardiopoietic stem cells have reached advanced clinical testing for ischemic heart failure. To profile their molecular influence on recipient hearts, systems proteomics was here applied in a chronic model of infarction randomized with and without human cardiopoietic stem cell treatment. Multidimensional label-free tandem mass spectrometry resolved and quantified 3987 proteins constituting the cardiac proteome. Infarction altered 450 proteins, reduced to 283 by stem cell treatment. Notably, cell therapy non-stochastically reversed a majority of infarction-provoked changes, remediating 85% of disease-affected protein clusters. Pathway and network analysis decoded functional reorganization, distinguished by prioritization of vasculogenesis, cardiac development, organ regeneration, and differentiation. Subproteome restoration nullified adverse ischemic effects, validated by echo-/electro-cardiographic documentation of improved cardiac chamber size, reduced QT prolongation and augmented ejection fraction post-cell therapy. Collectively, cardiopoietic stem cell intervention transitioned infarcted hearts from a cardiomyopathic trajectory towards pre-disease. Systems proteomics thus offers utility to delineate and interpret complex molecular regenerative outcomes."
"The increasing demand for a whiter smile has resulted in an increased popularity for tooth whitening procedures. The most classic hydrogen peroxide-based whitening agents are effective, but can lead to enamel demineralization, gingival irritation, or cytotoxicity. Furthermore, these techniques are excessively time-consuming. Here, we report a nondestructive, harmless and convenient tooth whitening strategy based on a piezo-catalysis effect realized by replacement of abrasives traditionally used in toothpaste with piezoelectric particles. Degradation of organic dyes via piezo-catalysis of BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles was performed under ultrasonic vibration to simulate daily tooth brushing. Teeth stained with black tea, blueberry juice, wine or a combination thereof can be notably whitened by the poled BTO turbid liquid after vibration for 3 h. A similar treatment using unpoled or cubic BTO show negligible tooth whitening effect. Furthermore, the BTO nanoparticle-based piezo-catalysis tooth whitening procedure exhibits remarkably less damage to both enamel and biological cells."
"In the present study we tested the effects of different transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols in the formation of visuo-spatial contextual learning (VSCL). The study comprised three experiments designed to evaluate tDCS-induced changes in VSCL measures collected during the execution of a visual search task widely used to examine statistical learning in the visuo-spatial domain. In Experiment 1, we probed for the effects of left-posterior parietal cortex (PPC) anodal-tDCS (AtDCS) at different timings (i.e. offline and online) and intensities (i.e. 3 mA and 1.5 mA). The protocol producing the more robust effect in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2 over the right-PPC, while in Experiment 3, cathodal-tDCS (CtDCS) was applied over the left-PPC only at a high intensity (i.e. 3 mA) but varying timing of application (offline and online). Results revealed that high intensity offline AtDCS reduced VSCL regardless of the stimulation side (Experiment 1 and 2), while no significant behavioral changes were produced by both online AtDCS protocols (Experiment 1) and offline/online CtDCS (Experiment 3). The reduced VSCL could result from homeostatic regulatory mechanisms hindering normal task-related neuroplastic phenomena."
"18F-FDG PET/CT imaging may help non-invasively disprove the diagnosis of acute kidney allograft rejection (AR) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). The present study aims at evaluating the repeatability and reproducibility of the quantification of renal 18F-FDG uptake in KTR. We prospectively performed 18F-FDG PET/CT in 95 adult KTR who underwent surveillance transplant biopsy between 3 to 6 months post transplantation. Images were obtained 180 minutes after injecting 3 MBq 18F-FDG per kg body weight. Mean standard uptake value (SUVmean) of kidney cortex was independently measured by 2 experienced observers in 4 volumes of interest (VOI) distributed in the upper (n = 2) and lower (n = 2) poles. The first observer repeated SUV assessment in the uppermost VOI, blinded to the initial results. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were calculated. An ICC of 0.96 with 95%CI of [0.94; 0.97] was calculated for the intra-observer measurements. The ICC for inter-observer reproducibility for each VOI was 0.87 [0.81–0.91], 0.87 [0.81–0.91], 0.85 [0.78–0.89] and 0.83 [0.76–0.88] for the upper to the lower renal poles, respectively. The repeatability and reproducibility of the quantification of kidney allograft 18F-FDG uptake are both consistent, which makes it transferrable to the clinical routine."
"Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is largely used to confirm pregnancy. Yet evidence shows that longitudinal hCG profiles are distinguishable between healthy and failing pregnancies. We retrospectively fitted a joint longitudinal-survival model to data from 127 (85 healthy and 42 failing pregnancies) US women, aged 18–45, who were attempting to conceive, to quantify the association between longitudinally measured urinary hCG and early miscarriage. Using subject-specific predictions, obtained uniquely from the joint model, we investigated the plausibility of adaptively monitoring early pregnancy outcomes based on updating hCG measurements. Volunteers collected daily early morning urine samples for their menstrual cycle and up to 28 days post day of missed period. The longitudinal submodel for log hCG included a random intercept and slope and fixed linear and quadratic time terms. The survival submodel included maternal age and cycle length covariates. Unit increases in log hCG corresponded to a 63.9% (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16, 0.47) decrease in the risk of miscarriage, confirming a strong association between hCG and miscarriage. Outputted conditional survival probabilities gave individualised risk estimates for the early pregnancy outcomes in the short term. However, longer term monitoring would require a larger sample size and prospectively followed up data, focusing on emerging extensions to the joint model, which allow assessment of the specificity and sensitivity."
"Oncogenic KRAS mutations are encountered in more than 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. MEK inhibition has failed to procure any clinical benefits in mutant RAS-driven cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To identify potential resistance mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor (MEKi) resistance in PDAC, we investigated lysosomal drug accumulation in PDAC models both in vitro and in vivo. Mouse PDAC models and human PDAC cell lines as well as human PDAC xenografts treated with the MEK inhibitor trametinib or refametinib led to an enhanced expression of lysosomal markers and enrichment of lysosomal gene sets. A time-dependent, increase in lysosomal content was observed upon MEK inhibition. Strikingly, there was a strong activation of lysosomal biogenesis in cell lines of the classical compared to the basal-like molecular subtype. Increase in lysosomal content was associated with nuclear translocation of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) and upregulation of TFEB target genes. siRNA-mediated depletion of TFEB led to a decreased lysosomal biogenesis upon MEK inhibition and potentiated sensitivity. Using LC-MS, we show accumulation of MEKi in the lysosomes of treated cells. Therefore, MEK inhibition triggers lysosomal biogenesis and subsequent drug sequestration. Combined targeting of MEK and lysosomal function may improve sensitivity to MEK inhibition in PDAC."
"The integrated stress response (ISR) converges on eIF2α phosphorylation to regulate protein synthesis. ISR is activated by several stress conditions, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, executed by protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). We report that ER stress combined with ISR inhibition causes an impaired maturation of several tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), consistent with a partial block of their trafficking from the ER to the Golgi. Other proteins mature or are secreted normally, indicating selective retention in the ER (sERr). sERr is relieved upon protein synthesis attenuation and is accompanied by the generation of large mixed disulfide bonded complexes, including ERp44. sERr was pharmacologically recapitulated by combining the HIV-protease inhibitor nelfinavir with ISRIB, an experimental drug that inhibits ISR. Nelfinavir/ISRIB combination is highly effective to inhibit the growth of RTK-addicted cell lines and hepatocellular (HCC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, pharmacological sERr can be utilized as a modality for cancer treatment."
"Chromatin accessibility is critical for tumor development, whose mechanisms remain unclear. As a crucial regulator for chromatin remodeling, BRD4 promotes tumor progression by regulating multiple genes. As a small-molecule inhibitor of BRD4, JQ1 has potent chemotherapeutic activity against various human cancers. However, whether JQ1 has potential anti-tumor effects and how JQ1 regulates global transcription in gastric cancer (GC) remain largely unknown. In this research, we found BRD4 was highly expressed in GC tissues and was significantly associated with poor prognosis. JQ1 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of GC cells in vitro. Besides, JQ1 suppressed the migration and invasion of cancer cells by inducing MET. Notably, an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data showed that JQ1 obviously downregulated the chromatin accessibility of GC cells and differentially accessible regions were highly enriched for RUNX2-binding motifs. Combinational analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data discovered NID1 as the downstream target of JQ1 and JQ1 reduced NID1 expression in GC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter gene assay, and rescue experiments all confirmed that RUNX2/NID1 axis was responsible for JQ1-inhibiting metastasis of GC cells. What’s more, high expression of NID1 in GC tissues also predicted poor survival outcome of cancer patients and NID1 knockdown prohibited migration and invasion of cancer cells via partially inducing MET. Finally, in vivo models showed that JQ1 prevented GC growth and suppressed cancer metastasis. In conclusion, JQ1 inhibits the malignant progression of GC by downregulating chromatin accessibility and inactivating RUNX2/NID1 signaling. In addition, NID1 is also a novel therapeutic target for progressive GC patients."
"Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a poor prognosis owing to difficulties in the diagnosis of resectable PC at early stages. Several clinical studies have indicated that the detection and surgery of small resectable PC (<1 cm) can significantly improve survival; however, imaging diagnosis and accurate resection of small PC remain challenging. Here, we report the feasibility of “immuno-OpenPET” as a novel approach enabling not only early diagnosis but also image-guided surgery, using a small (<1 cm) resectable PC orthotopic xenograft mouse model. For immuno-OpenPET, we utilized our original OpenPET system, which enables high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with depth-of-interaction detectors, as well as real-time image-guided surgery, by arranging the detectors to create an open space for surgery and accelerating the image reconstruction process by graphics processing units. For immuno-OpenPET, 64Cu-labeled anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab was intraperitoneally administered into mice. It clearly identified PC tumors ≥3 mm. In contrast, neither OpenPET with intravenous-administered 64Cu-cetuximab nor intraperitoneal/intravenous-administered 18F-FDG (a traditional PET probe) could detect PC in this model. Immuno-OpenPET-guided surgery accurately resected small PC in mice and achieved significantly prolonged survival. This technology could provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for small resectable PC to improve patient survival."
"Smoking behaviors, including amount smoked, smoking cessation, and tobacco-related diseases, are altered by the rate of nicotine clearance. Nicotine clearance can be estimated using the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) (ratio of 3′hydroxycotinine/cotinine), but only in current smokers. Advancing the genomics of this highly heritable biomarker of CYP2A6, the main metabolic enzyme for nicotine, will also enable investigation of never and former smokers. We performed the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date of the NMR in European ancestry current smokers (n = 5185), found 1255 genome-wide significant variants, and replicated the chromosome 19 locus. Fine-mapping of chromosome 19 revealed 13 putatively causal variants, with nine of these being highly putatively causal and mapping to CYP2A6, MAP3K10, ADCK4, and CYP2B6. We also identified a putatively causal variant on chromosome 4 mapping to TMPRSS11E and demonstrated an association between TMPRSS11E variation and a UGT2B17 activity phenotype. Together the 14 putatively causal SNPs explained ~38% of NMR variation, a substantial increase from the ~20 to 30% previously explained. Our additional GWASs of nicotine intake biomarkers showed that cotinine and smoking intensity (cotinine/cigarettes per day (CPD)) shared chromosome 19 and chromosome 4 loci with the NMR, and that cotinine and a more accurate biomarker, cotinine + 3′hydroxycotinine, shared a chromosome 15 locus near CHRNA5 with CPD and Pack-Years (i.e., cumulative exposure). Understanding the genetic factors influencing smoking-related traits facilitates epidemiological studies of smoking and disease, as well as assists in optimizing smoking cessation support, which in turn will reduce the enormous personal and societal costs associated with smoking."
"Periodontal disease is a microbially-mediated inflammatory disease of tooth-supporting tissues that leads to bone and tissue loss around teeth. Although bacterially-mediated mechanisms of alveolar bone destruction have been widely studied, the effects of a polymicrobial infection on the periodontal ligament and microbiome/virome have not been well explored. Therefore, the current investigation introduced a new mouse model of periodontal disease to examine the effects of a polymicrobial infection on periodontal ligament (PDL) properties, changes in bone loss, the host immune response, and the microbiome/virome using shotgun sequencing. Periodontal pathogens, namely Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were used as the polymicrobial oral inoculum in BALB/cByJ mice. The polymicrobial infection triggered significant alveolar bone loss, a heightened antibody response, an elevated cytokine immune response, a significant shift in viral diversity and virome composition, and a widening of the PDL space; the latter two findings have not been previously reported in periodontal disease models. Changes in the PDL space were present at sites far away from the site of insult, indicating that the polymicrobial radius of effect extends beyond the bone loss areas and site of initial infection and wider than previously appreciated. Associations were found between bone loss, specific viral and bacterial species, immune genes, and PDL space changes. These findings may have significant implications for the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and biomechanical properties of the periodontium. This new polymicrobial mouse model of periodontal disease in a common mouse strain is useful for evaluating the features of periodontal disease."
"The expression of lysine methyltransferase SET8, which is involved in carcinogenesis of many types of human cancers through monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), is associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a functional analysis for SET8 to assess its effect on HCC progression. SET8 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. SET8 knockdown also inhibited tumour growth in a human xenograft mouse model. Overexpression of SET8 displayed the reverse effect, while treatment with the SET8 inhibitor UNC0379 produced an effect similar to SET8 knockdown. In addition, drug sensitivity testing in SET8-siRNA transfected HCC cells indicated that docetaxel inhibited cell growth dramatically, as demonstrated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Furthermore, gene expression microarray analysis showed that genes altered after SET8 knockdown were clustered in pathways related to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our data suggests that targeting SET8 for HCC therapy can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells as well as increase their sensitivity to chemotherapy."
"Morning blood pressure surge (MBPS) had been known to be associated with hypertensive target organ injury and vascular events. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is also known to be related with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. This study investigated the effect of MBPS on patients with RVO. In total, 76 patients with RVO who had undergone systemic cardiovascular examination including a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, carotid artery intima media thickness, and pulse wave velocity were evaluated between January 2015 and February 2019. The MBPS was calculated as follows: mean systolic blood pressure measured over two hours after awakening minus mean systolic blood pressure measured during the one hour that included the lowest sleep blood pressure. Macular edema was significantly more prevalent in the MBPS group compared with the non-MBPS group. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate regression analyses revealed that MBPS independently predicted macular edema in patients with RVO [Odds ratio 4.75, 95% confidence interval 1.136–16.6, p = 0.015]. In conclusion, evaluating blood pressure patterns, especially MBPS, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be useful for assessing and predicting ophthalmologic outcome and may facilitate better blood pressure control in patients with RVO."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The immune-rich contexture of the HCC microenvironment makes this tumour an appealing target for immune-based therapies. Here, we discuss how the functional characteristics of the liver microenvironment can potentially be harnessed for the treatment of HCC. We will review the evidence supporting a therapeutic role for vaccines, cell-based therapies and immune-checkpoint inhibitors and discuss the potential for patient stratification in an attempt to overcome the series of failures that has characterised drug development in this disease area."
"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. A-to-I editing of RNA is a widespread posttranscriptional process that has recently emerged as an important mechanism in cancer biology. A-to-I editing levels are high in several human cancers, including thyroid cancer, but ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing thyroid cancer progression are unexplored. To address the importance of RNA A-to-I editing in thyroid cancer, we examined the role of ADAR1. Loss-of-function analysis showed that ADAR1 suppression profoundly repressed proliferation, invasion, and migration in thyroid tumor cell models. These observations were validated in an in vivo xenograft model, which showed that ADAR1-silenced cells had a diminished ability to form tumors. RNA editing of miRNAs has the potential to markedly alter target recognition. According to TCGA data, the tumor suppressor miR-200b is overedited in thyroid tumors, and its levels of editing correlate with a worse progression-free survival and disease stage. We confirmed miR-200b overediting in thyroid tumors and we showed that edited miR-200b has weakened activity against its target gene ZEB1 in thyroid cancer cells, likely explaining the reduced aggressiveness of ADAR1-silenced cells. We also found that RAS, but not BRAF, modulates ADAR1 levels, an effect mediated predominantly by PI3K and in part by MAPK. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of ADAR1 activity with the editing inhibitor 8-azaadenosine reduced cancer cell aggressiveness. Overall, our data implicate ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing as an important pathway in thyroid cancer progression, and highlight RNA editing as a potential therapeutic target in thyroid cancer."
"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is one of the most serious and iatrogenic complications that can occur during in vitro fertilization treatment. Although the pathogenesis of OHSS is not fully understood, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized as an important mediator of the development of OHSS. Transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-β1) is known to regulate various ovarian functions. However, whether VEGF can be regulated by TGF-β1 in human granulosa cells has not been determined. In addition, the role of TGF-β1 in the pathogenesis of OHSS remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulates VEGF expression in and secretion from both immortalized human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells and primary hGL cells. Our results demonstrate that the SMAD2/3, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are involved in TGF-β1-induced VEGF expression and secretion. Using a mouse OHSS model, we show that the expression levels of TGF-β1 and VEGF are increased in the ovaries of OHSS mice. Blocking TGF-β1 signaling inhibits the development of OHSS by attenuating VEGF expression. Moreover, clinical results reveal that the protein levels of TGF-β1 and VEGF are increased in the follicular fluid of patients with OHSS, and that the levels of these two proteins in the follicular fluid are positively correlated. The results of this study help to elucidate the mechanisms by which VEGF expression is regulated in hGL cells, which could lead to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for treating OHSS."
"The retina decomposes visual stimuli into parallel channels that encode different features of the visual environment. Central to this computation is the synaptic processing in a dense layer of neuropil, the so-called inner plexiform layer (IPL). Here, different types of bipolar cells stratifying at distinct depths relay the excitatory feedforward drive from photoreceptors to amacrine and ganglion cells. Current experimental techniques for studying processing in the IPL do not allow imaging the entire IPL simultaneously in the intact tissue. Here, we extend a two-photon microscope with an electrically tunable lens allowing us to obtain optical vertical slices of the IPL, which provide a complete picture of the response diversity of bipolar cells at a “single glance”. The nature of these axial recordings additionally allowed us to isolate and investigate batch effects, i.e. inter-experimental variations resulting in systematic differences in response speed. As a proof of principle, we developed a simple model that disentangles biological from experimental causes of variability and allowed us to recover the characteristic gradient of response speeds across the IPL with higher precision than before. Our new framework will make it possible to study the computations performed in the central synaptic layer of the retina more efficiently."
"This study aimed to investigate the predictive factors of concomitant bacteremia occurring in febrile infants who initially presented with pyuria and fever, and were subsequently diagnosed with culture-proven urinary tract infection (UTI). We conducted a retrospective cohort study for January 2010–October 2018 that included infants younger than six months with febrile UTI at a tertiary hospital. The study included 463 patients, of whom 34 had a concomitant bacteremic UTI. Compared to those in the non-bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI) group, the bacteremic UTI group had a lower mean age; higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), delta neutrophil index (DNI, reflects the fraction of immature granulocytes) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN); lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin; and a lower platelet count. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected nearly twice as often in patients with bacteremic UTI compared to those with non-bacteremic UTI (59.3% vs. 30.6%; P = 0.003). Univariate logistic analyses showed that age ≤90 days; higher DNI, CRP, and creatinine levels; lower Hb and albumin levels; and the presence of VUR were predictors for bacteremic UTI. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age ≤90 days, higher DNI and CRP levels, and the presence of VUR were independent predictors of bacteremic UTI. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multivariate model was 0.859 (95% CI, 0.779–0.939; P < 0.001). Age ≤90 days, higher DNI and CRP values may help predict bacteremia of febrile infants younger than 6 months with UTI. Vesicoureteral reflux imaging is also recommended in infants with bacteremic UTI to evaluate VUR."
"MicroRNAs mediate posttranscriptional gene regulation. The aim of the study was to find a microRNA predictor of successful atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. A total of 109 patients undergoing first-time AF ablation were included. Nineteen patients were selected to undergo serum microRNA sequencing (study group). The sequencing data were used to select several microRNAs that correlated with 12-month recurrences after AF ablation. Those microRNAs were validated by digital droplet PCR in samples from remaining 90 patients. All patients underwent pulmonary vein isolation (RF ablation, contact force catheter, electroanatomical system). The endpoint of the study was the 12-month AF recurrence rate; the overall recurrence rate was 42.5%. In total, levels of 34 miRNAs were significantly different in sera from patients with AF recurrence compared to patients without AF recurrence. Six microRNAs (miR-183-5p, miR-182-5p, miR-32-5p, miR-107, miR-574-3p, and miR-144-3p) were validated in the whole group. Data from the validation group did not confirm the observations from the study group, as no significant differences were found between miRNAs serum levels in patients with and without recurrences 12 months after AF ablation."
"It is well established that alterations in phosphate metabolism have a profound effect on hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity. The present-day clinical form of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was preceded by phosphorus necrosis of the jaw, ca. 1860. The subsequent removal of yellow phosphorus from matches in the early 20th century saw a parallel decline in “phossy jaw” until the early 2000s, when similar reports of unusual jaw bone necrosis began to appear in the literature describing jaw necrosis in patients undergoing chemotherapy and concomitant steroid and bisphosphonate treatment. Today, the potential side effect of ONJ associated with medications that block osteoclast activity (antiresorptive) is well known, though the mechanism remains unclear and the management and outcomes are often unsatisfactory. Much of the existing literature has focused on the continuing concerns of appropriate use of bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive medications, the incomplete or underdeveloped research on ONJ, and the use of drugs with anabolic potential for treatment of osteoporosis. While recognizing that ONJ is a rare occurrence and ONJ-associated medications play an important role in fracture risk reduction in osteoporotic patients, evidence to date suggests that health care providers can lower the risk further by dental evaluations and care prior to initiating antiresorptive therapies and by monitoring dental health during and after treatment. This review describes the current clinical management guidelines for ONJ, the critical role of dental-medical management in mitigating risks, and the current understanding of the effects of predominantly osteoclast-modulating drugs on bone homeostasis."
"Kidney tumours are among the most common solid tumours in children, comprising distinct subtypes differing in many aspects, including cell-of-origin, genetics, and pathology. Pre-clinical cell models capturing the disease heterogeneity are currently lacking. Here, we describe the first paediatric cancer organoid biobank. It contains tumour and matching normal kidney organoids from over 50 children with different subtypes of kidney cancer, including Wilms tumours, malignant rhabdoid tumours, renal cell carcinomas, and congenital mesoblastic nephromas. Paediatric kidney tumour organoids retain key properties of native tumours, useful for revealing patient-specific drug sensitivities. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and high resolution 3D imaging, we further demonstrate that organoid cultures derived from Wilms tumours consist of multiple different cell types, including epithelial, stromal and blastemal-like cells. Our organoid biobank captures the heterogeneity of paediatric kidney tumours, providing a representative collection of well-characterised models for basic cancer research, drug-screening and personalised medicine."
"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of infection, but whether the risks are attenuated in different patient groups remains unclear. This study enrolled participants with CKD stages 1–3 in the New Taipei City Health Screening Program between 2005 and 2008. A proportional hazard regression model was employed to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for infection-related hospitalization and mortality in younger (<50-year-old) and older (≥50-year-old) CKD patients. Of 119,871 adults, there were 14,207 cases of first hospitalization for infection during a median follow-up of 8.14 years; 45.5% of these cases were younger patients. Unlike CKD stage 1 and 2 patients, the risk of infection-related hospitalization in younger CKD stage 3 patients is as high as for older CKD stage 3 patients. Proteinuria increases the risk of infection-related hospitalization independent of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels in older CKD patients but this relationship is weak in their younger counterparts. In conclusion, the risk of infection-related hospitalization is high in subgroups of CKD patients. Prevention and treatment of infections in these patients merit more attention."
"We describe a new technique, high fidelity Imaging Retinal Densitometry (IRD), which probes the functional integrity of the outer retinal complex. We demonstrate the ability of the technique to map visual pigment optical density and synthesis rates in eyes with and without macular disease. A multispectral retinal imaging device obtained precise measurements of retinal reflectance over space and time. Data obtained from healthy controls and 5 patients with intermediate AMD, before and after photopigment bleaching, were used to quantify visual pigment metrics. Heat maps were plotted to summarise the topography of rod and cone pigment kinetics and descriptive statistics conducted to highlight differences between those with and without AMD. Rod and cone visual pigment synthesis rates in those with AMD (v = 0.043 SD 0.019 min−1 and v = 0.119 SD 0.046 min−1, respectively) were approximately half those observed in healthy controls (v = 0.079 SD 0.024 min−1 for rods and v = 0.206 SD 0.069 min−1 for cones). By mapping visual pigment kinetics across the central retina, high fidelity IRD provides a unique insight into outer retinal complex function. This new technique will improve the phenotypic characterisation, diagnosis and treatment monitoring of various ocular pathologies, including AMD."
"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and complications of the XEN implant as a solo procedure or in association with cataract surgery in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG). All patients who received a XEN implant between June 2017 and June 2018 were included in the study. The primary and secondary outcomes were: the reduction of the intraocular pressure (IOP) at 6 months postoperatively, the decrease of the glaucoma medications 6 months after surgery, the clinical success rate (eyes (%) achieving ≥20% IOP reduction on the same or fewer medications without secondary surgical intervention), the frequency and type of postoperative interventions as well as the complication rate. We included one hundred and seven eyes from 97 patients with primary OAG (79%), or secondary OAG (21%). Seventy-seven patients (72%) received a standalone XEN implantation and 30 (28%) underwent XEN implantation combined with phacoemusification. The IOP decreased from 20.4 mm Hg ± 6.4 preoperatively to 15.4 mm Hg ± 5.3 six months after the surgery, which represented a reduction of 24.5% (P = 1.4.10−7). It was associated with a lowering of glaucoma medications from 2.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 0.6 ± 1.0 six months postoperatively (P = 3.6.10−34). The clinical success rate was 67.2% six months after the surgery. The most frequent complications were: IOP spikes >30 mmHg (16.8%), improper position or angled drain (14.0%) and transient minimal hyphema (<1 week) (11.2%). During the follow-up, the needling was required in 34.6% of cases and a total of 10 eyes (9.4%) required a new glaucoma surgery. To conclude XEN implantation appears to be an effective short- and mid-term surgical technique to control IOP in OAG with a low risk of complication. However postoperative maneuvers were frequently required to maintain efficiency."
"Study designQualitative study.ObjectivesTo formulate recommendations for standards of physiotherapy care for people with complete traumatic paraplegia in India using a Delphi methodology.SettingIndia.MethodsTwenty-three physiotherapy experts were invited to participate in an online consensus process. Fourteen (n = 14) of 23 physiotherapy experts from India accepted an invitation to participate in an online consensus development exercise (Response rate—60.86%). Four rounds of consensus meetings were conducted which involved posting the quotations from a previous study on expectations of people with paraplegia to obtain perceptions of physiotherapy experts in round 1, retrieving codes/code groups from round 1, posting these code groups in rounds 2 and 3 for experts’ agreement/disagreement, the preparation of the draft of recommendations, and posting it in round 4 for experts’ opinion. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ATLASti software for qualitative data analysis.ResultRecommendations for physiotherapy care for persons with complete traumatic paraplegia in India are presented.ConclusionsEducation to patients and/or caregivers regarding care post injury is one of the important recommendations by physiotherapy experts. It is emphasized that the subjective assessment of the patients, including their needs and preferences, is equally important as that of their objective assessment. Physiotherapy students and practicing physiotherapists must also enhance their knowledge to provide optimal physiotherapy care to people with paraplegia."
"Anatomic reconstruction of articular fractures is one of the critical factors in later achieving good functional outcome. Intraoperative 3D imaging has been shown to offer better evaluation and therefore can significantly improve the results. The purpose of this study was to assess the difference between intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopy (3D) and intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) imaging regarding fracture reduction, implant placement and articular impressions in a distal humeral fracture model. AO type 13-B2 fracture pattern were created in upper extremity cadaver specimens. Articular step-offs, intra-articular screw placement and intraarticular impressions of different degrees of severity were created. All specimens had imaging performed. For each articular pattern 3D fluoroscopy in standard (3Ds) and high quality (3Dh) were performed (Arcadis Orbic, Siemens, Germany) as well as an intraoperative CT scan (iCT, Airo, Brainlab, Germany). Three observers evaluated all imaging studies regarding subjective and objective parameters. iCT is more precise than 3D fluoroscopic imaging for detection of articular impressions. Articular step-offs and intraarticular screw placement are similar for iCT and 3D. Subjective imaging quality is the highest for iCT and lowest for 3Ds. Intraoperative CT may be particularly useful in assessing articular impressions and providing a good subjective image quality for the surgeon."
"Systematic characterization of the cancer microbiome provides the opportunity to develop techniques that exploit non-human, microorganism-derived molecules in the diagnosis of a major human disease. Following recent demonstrations that some types of cancer show substantial microbial contributions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, we re-examined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas11 (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,116 samples) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major types of cancer. These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia–IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. This potential microbiome-based oncology diagnostic tool warrants further exploration."
"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common and lethal human urological malignancies in the world. One of the pathological drivers for ccRCC is the Ras family of small GTPases that function as “molecular switches” in many diseases including ccRCC. Among the GTPases in the Di-Ras family, DIRAS2 gene encodes a GTPase that shares 60% homology to Ras and Rap. Yet little is known about the biological function(s) of Di-Ras2 or how its activities are regulated. In this study, we focused on Di-Ras2, and determined its functions and underlying mechanism during formation of ccRCC. We found that Di-Ras2 was upregulated in ccRCC, and promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of human ccRCC cells in the absence of von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL). Mechanistically, Di-Ras2 induces and regulates ccRCC formation by modulating phosphorylation of the downstream effectors and activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Moreover, Di-Ras2 interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase, pVHL, which facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of Di-Ras2. Together, these results indicate a potential function of Di-Ras2 as an oncogene in ccRCC, and these data provide a new perspective of the relationship between pVHL and the MAPK pathway in ccRCC tumorigenesis."
"A hospital-based cross-sectional study in SIGES project was conducted during 2016.5–2017.5 in West China Hospital. It was aimed to observe the prevalence of atrophic gastritis (AG) in southwest China, and assess the diagnostic strength of serum gastrin-17 (G-17) in predicting AG in Chinese population. Asymptomatic healthy controls from health check-up, cancer-free patients with unspecific upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and histologically proven gastric cancer patients were eligible, if serum pepsinogen-I (PG-I), PG-II, and G-17 were detected. AG status was classified by the accredited cutoffs of PG-I (<70 ug/L) and PG-I/II ratio (<3). Totally, healthy controls (n = 9,425), symptomatic patients (n = 671) and gastric cancer patients (n = 305) were simultaneously observed, in which the prevalence of AG in southwest China were estimated as 15.9/1,000, 28.3/1,000, and 55.7/1,000 persons, respectively. The age-specific prevalence of AG in healthy controls showed a significantly uphill trend (p for trend <0.001). Higher level of serum G-17 was significantly associated with increased risk of AG in healthy population (15–30 pmol/L, aOR = 20.67, 95% CI 9.17–46.55; >30 pmol/L, aOR = 314.41, 95% CI 166.10–595.12). Throughout the progression of stomach diseases, the diagnostic strength of serum G-17 for AG showed a downhill trend across more advanced situations. In despite of that, serum G-17 displayed a good performance in predicting AG in the entire cross-sectional population (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.89–0.94; SEN = 85.5%; SPE = 93.2%; LR+ = 12.55; LR− = 0.11). Population in southwest China had intermediate prevalence of AG, while the prevalence was increased over age or disease progression. High level of serum G-17 might be a reliable non-invasive measurement to predict AG in southwest Chinese population."
"The rapid development of new therapies in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), entails a need for improved prognostic and monitoring tools. Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is involved in DNA synthesis and its activity correlates to outcome in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum TK1 activity (sTK1) levels in MBC patients as a tool for prognostication and treatment monitoring. 142 women with MBC scheduled for 1st line systemic treatment were included in a prospective observational study. sTK1 was measured at baseline (BL) and at 1, 3 and 6 months and correlations to progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS) evaluated. High sTK1 levels (above median) correlated to worse PFS and OS at BL, also after adjusting for other prognostic factors. sTK1 levels were significantly associated with PFS and OS measured from follow-up time points during therapy. Changes from 3 to 6 months during therapy significantly correlated to PFS and OS, whereas early changes did not. We could demonstrate sTK1 level as an independent prognostic factor in patients with newly diagnosed MBC. Changes in sTK1 levels from 3 to 6 months correlated to PFS and OS. Future studies of sTK1 are warranted to further define its clinical utility."
"The diagnosis of lymphomas and leukemias requires hematopathologists to integrate microscopically visible cellular morphology with antibody-identified cell surface molecule expression. To merge these into one high-throughput, highly multiplexed, single-cell assay, we quantify cell morphological features by their underlying, antibody-measurable molecular components, which empowers mass cytometers to ‘see’ like pathologists. When applied to 71 diverse clinical samples, single-cell morphometric profiling reveals robust and distinct patterns of ‘morphometric’ markers for each major cell type. Individually, lamin B1 highlights acute leukemias, lamin A/C helps distinguish normal from neoplastic mature T cells, and VAMP-7 recapitulates light-cytometric side scatter. Combined with machine learning, morphometric markers form intuitive visualizations of normal and neoplastic cellular distribution and differentiation. When recalibrated for myelomonocytic blast enumeration, this approach is superior to flow cytometry and comparable to expert microscopy, bypassing years of specialized training. The contextualization of traditional surface markers on independent morphometric frameworks permits more sensitive and automated diagnosis of complex hematopoietic diseases."
"Cleavage of the gasdermin proteins to produce pore-forming amino-terminal fragments causes inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis)1. Gasdermin E (GSDME, also known as DFNA5)—mutated in familial ageing-related hearing loss2—can be cleaved by caspase 3, thereby converting noninflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis in GSDME-expressing cells3,4,5. GSDME expression is suppressed in many cancers, and reduced GSDME levels are associated with decreased survival as a result of breast cancer2,6, suggesting that GSDME might be a tumour suppressor. Here we show that 20 of 22 tested cancer-associated GSDME mutations reduce GSDME function. In mice, knocking out Gsdme in GSDME-expressing tumours enhances, whereas ectopic expression in Gsdme-repressed tumours inhibits, tumour growth. This tumour suppression is mediated by killer cytotoxic lymphocytes: it is abrogated in perforin-deficient mice or mice depleted of killer lymphocytes. GSDME expression enhances the phagocytosis of tumour cells by tumour-associated macrophages, as well as the number and functions of tumour-infiltrating natural-killer and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Killer-cell granzyme B also activates caspase-independent pyroptosis in target cells by directly cleaving GSDME at the same site as caspase 3. Uncleavable or pore-defective GSDME proteins are not tumour suppressive. Thus, tumour GSDME acts as a tumour suppressor by activating pyroptosis, enhancing anti-tumour immunity."
"Bioorthogonal chemistry capable of operating in live animals is needed to investigate biological processes such as cell death and immunity. Recent studies have identified a gasdermin family of pore-forming proteins that executes inflammasome-dependent and -independent pyroptosis1,2,3,4,5. Pyroptosis is proinflammatory, but its effect on antitumour immunity is unknown. Here we establish a bioorthogonal chemical system, in which a cancer-imaging probe phenylalanine trifluoroborate (Phe-BF3) that can enter cells desilylates and ‘cleaves’ a designed linker that contains a silyl ether. This system enabled the controlled release of a drug from an antibody–drug conjugate in mice. When combined with nanoparticle-mediated delivery, desilylation catalysed by Phe-BF3 could release a client protein—including an active gasdermin—from a nanoparticle conjugate, selectively into tumour cells in mice. We applied this bioorthogonal system to gasdermin, which revealed that pyroptosis of less than 15% of tumour cells was sufficient to clear the entire 4T1 mammary tumour graft. The tumour regression was absent in immune-deficient mice or upon T cell depletion, and was correlated with augmented antitumour immune responses. The injection of a reduced, ineffective dose of nanoparticle-conjugated gasdermin along with Phe-BF3 sensitized 4T1 tumours to anti-PD1 therapy. Our bioorthogonal system based on Phe-BF3 desilylation is therefore a powerful tool for chemical biology; our application of this system suggests that pyroptosis-induced inflammation triggers robust antitumour immunity and can synergize with checkpoint blockade."
"The effect of GVHD on transplant outcomes after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is not yet fully understood. Pediatric patients aged 0–15 years with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent their first UCBT (n = 740) were selected from the Japanese registry. Fifty percent of the patients received a UCB unit containing more than 5.0 × 107/kg total nucleated cells. The occurrence of grade III–IV acute GVHD was associated with a higher risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM, hazard ratio [HR] 4.07, P < 0.001) compared with no acute GVHD. Grade I–II acute GVHD was not associated with NRM. The occurrence of grade I–II or grade III–IV acute GVHD was not associated with a relapse risk. These findings showed that grade I–II acute GVHD carried no survival benefit and grade III–IV acute GVHD had an adverse effect (HR 1.68, P = 0.007). The occurrence of limited chronic GVHD was associated with a low risk of overall mortality (HR 0.60, P = 0.045). Severe acute GVHD should be prevented because of its association with high overall mortality and NRM in pediatric single UCBT. Mild acute GVHD provides no overall benefit. Mild chronic GVHD may be beneficial for survival."
"“Quantile-dependent expressivity” is a dependence of genetic effects on whether the phenotype (e.g., triglycerides) is high or low relative to its distribution in the population. Quantile-specific offspring-parent regression slopes (βOP) were estimated by quantile regression for 6227 offspring-parent pairs. Quantile-specific heritability (h2), estimated by 2βOP/(1 + rspouse), decreased 0.0047 ± 0.0007 (P = 2.9 × 10−14) for each one-percent decrement in fasting triglyceride concentrations, i.e., h2 ± SE were: 0.428 ± 0.059, 0.230 ± 0.030, 0.111 ± 0.015, 0.050 ± 0.016, and 0.033 ± 0.010 at the 90th, 75th, 50th, 25th, and 10th percentiles of the triglyceride distribution, respectively. Consistent with quantile-dependent expressivity, 11 drug studies report smaller genotype differences at lower (post-treatment) than higher (pre-treatment) triglyceride concentrations. This meant genotype-specific triglyceride changes could not move in parallel when triglycerides were decreased pharmacologically, so that subtracting pre-treatment from post-treatment triglyceride levels necessarily created a greater triglyceride decrease for the genotype with a higher pre-treatment value (purported precision-medicine genetic markers). In addition, sixty-five purported gene-environment interactions were found to be potentially attributable to triglyceride’s quantile-dependent expressivity, including gene-adiposity (APOA5, APOB, APOE, GCKR, IRS-1, LPL, MTHFR, PCSK9, PNPLA3, PPARγ2), gene-exercise (APOA1, APOA2, LPL), gene-diet (APOA5, APOE, INSIG2, LPL, MYB, NXPH1, PER2, TNFA), gene-alcohol (ALDH2, APOA5, APOC3, CETP, LPL), gene-smoking (APOC3, CYBA, LPL, USF1), gene-pregnancy (LPL), and gene-insulin resistance interactions (APOE, LPL)."
"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is the major single cause of stillbirth1 and is also associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality2,3, impaired health and educational achievement in childhood4,5 and with a range of diseases in later life6. Effective screening and intervention for FGR is an unmet clinical need. Here, we performed ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC–MS/MS) metabolomics on maternal serum at 12, 20 and 28 weeks of gestational age (wkGA) using 175 cases of term FGR and 299 controls from the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study, conducted in Cambridge, UK, to identify predictive metabolites. Internal validation using 36 wkGA samples demonstrated that a ratio of the products of the relative concentrations of two positively associated metabolites (1-(1-enyl-stearoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC (P-18:0/18:1) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol) to the product of the relative concentrations of two negatively associated metabolites (5α-androstan-3α,17α-diol disulfate and N1,N12-diacetylspermine) predicted FGR at term. The ratio had approximately double the discrimination as compared to a previously developed angiogenic biomarker7, the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1:placental growth factor (sFLT1:PlGF) ratio (AUC 0.78 versus 0.64, P = 0.0001). We validated the predictive performance of the metabolite ratio in two sub-samples of a demographically dissimilar cohort, Born in Bradford (BiB), conducted in Bradford, UK (P = 0.0002). Screening and intervention using this metabolite ratio in conjunction with ultrasonic imaging at around 36 wkGA could plausibly prevent adverse events through enhanced fetal monitoring and targeted induction of labor."
"The ID complex, involving the proteins FANCI and FANCD2, is required for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and related lesions1. These proteins are mutated in Fanconi anaemia, a disease in which patients are predisposed to cancer. The Fanconi anaemia pathway of ICL repair is activated when a replication fork stalls at an ICL2; this triggers monoubiquitination of the ID complex, in which one ubiquitin molecule is conjugated to each of FANCI and FANCD2. Monoubiquitination of ID is essential for ICL repair by excision, translesion synthesis and homologous recombination; however, its function remains unknown1,3. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the monoubiquitinated human ID complex bound to DNA, and reveal that it forms a closed ring that encircles the DNA. By comparison with the structure of the non-ubiquitinated ID complex bound to ICL DNA—which we also report here—we show that monoubiquitination triggers a complete rearrangement of the open, trough-like ID structure through the ubiquitin of one protomer binding to the other protomer in a reciprocal fashion. These structures—together with biochemical data—indicate that the monoubiquitinated ID complex loses its preference for ICL and related branched DNA structures, and becomes a sliding DNA clamp that can coordinate the subsequent repair reactions. Our findings also reveal how monoubiquitination in general can induce an alternative protein structure with a new function."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is closely associated with liver fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and cancer-associated myofibroblasts are key players in liver fibrogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis. Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors contributes to HCC development and progression. This study aimed to elucidate the role of FGFs in the HSC-HCC crosstalk. Analysis of the expression of the fifteen paracrine FGF-members revealed that FGF9 was only expressed by HSC but not by HCC cells. Also in human HCC tissues, HSC/stromal myofibroblasts were identified as cellular source of FGF9. High expression levels of FGF9 significantly correlated with poor patient survival. Stimulation with recombinant FGF9 induced ERK- and JNK-activation combined with significantly enhanced proliferation, clonogenicity, and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, FGF9 significantly reduced the sensitivity of HCC cells against sorafenib. Protumorigenic effects of FGF9 on HCC cells were almost completely abrogated by the FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor BGJ398, while the selective FGFR4 inhibitor BLU9931 had no significant effect. In conclusion, these data indicate that stroma-derived FGF9 promotes tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance of HCC cells and FGF9 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Herewith, FGF9 appears as potential prognostic marker and novel therapeutic target in HCC."
"Cancer chemotherapy targeting frequent loss of heterozygosity events is an attractive concept, since tumor cells may lack enzymatic activities present in normal constitutional cells. To find exploitable targets, we map prevalent genetic polymorphisms to protein structures and identify 45 nsSNVs (non-synonymous small nucleotide variations) near the catalytic sites of 17 enzymes frequently lost in cancer. For proof of concept, we select the gastrointestinal drug metabolic enzyme NAT2 at 8p22, which is frequently lost in colorectal cancers and has a common variant with 10-fold reduced activity. Small molecule screening results in a cytotoxic kinase inhibitor that impairs growth of cells with slow NAT2 and decreases the growth of tumors with slow NAT2 by half as compared to those with wild-type NAT2. Most of the patient-derived CRC cells expressing slow NAT2 also show sensitivity to 6-(4-aminophenyl)-N-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)pyrazin-2-amine (APA) treatment. These findings indicate that the therapeutic index of anti-cancer drugs can be altered by bystander mutations affecting drug metabolic genes."
"Remodeling transcription by targeting bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins has emerged as promising anticancer strategy. Here, we identify a novel synergistic interaction of the BET inhibitor JQ1 with the PI3Kα-specific inhibitor BYL719 to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis and to suppress tumor growth in models of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RNA-Seq revealed that JQ1/BYL719 co-treatment shifts the overall balance of BCL-2 family gene expression towards apoptosis and upregulates expression of BMF, BCL2L11 (BIM), and PMAIP1 (NOXA) while downregulating BCL2L1 (BCL-xL). These changes were confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of RNA-Seq data followed by validation qRT-PCR and western blot identified MYC and FOXO3a as potential transcription factors (TFs) upstream of the observed gene expression pattern. Immunoprecipitation (IP) studies showed that JQ1/BYL719-stimulated increase in BIM expression enhances the neutralization of antiapoptotic BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1. This promotes the activation of BAK and BAX and caspase-dependent apoptosis, as (1) individual silencing of BMF, BIM, NOXA, BAK, or BAX, (2) overexpression of BCL-2 or MCL-1 or (3) the caspase inhibitor N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-Me) fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) all rescue JQ1/BYL719-induced cell death. In conclusion, co-inhibition of BET proteins and PI3Kα cooperatively induces mitochondrial apoptosis by proapoptotic re-balancing of BCL-2 family proteins. This discovery opens exciting perspectives for therapeutic exploitation of BET inhibitors in RMS."
"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is a leading cause of skin cancers and an ubiquitous environmental exposure. However, the molecular mechanisms relating UVR exposure to melanoma is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if lifetime UVR exposure could be robustly associated to DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed DNAm in whole blood in three data sets (n = 183, 191, and 125) from the Norwegian Woman and Cancer cohort, using Illumina platforms. We studied genome-wide DNAm, targeted analyses of CpG sites indicated in the literature, global methylation, and accelerated aging. Lifetime history of UVR exposure (residential ambient UVR, sunburns, sunbathing vacations and indoor tanning) was collected by questionnaires. We used one data set for discovery and the other two for replication. One CpG site showed a genome-wide significant association to cumulative UVR exposure (cg01884057) (pnominal = 3.96e-08), but was not replicated in any of the two replication sets (pnominal ≥ 0.42). Two CpG sites (cg05860019, cg00033666) showed suggestive associations with the other UVR exposures. We performed extensive analyses of the association between long-term UVR exposure and DNAm. There was no indication of a robust effect of past UVR exposure on DNAm."
"APOEε4 is the most well-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease and is associated with cerebral amyloid-β. However, the association between APOEε4 and tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer’s disease, has been controversial. Here, we sought to determine whether the relationship between APOEε4 and tau pathology is determined by local interactions with amyloid-β. We examined three independent samples of cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease subjects: (1) 211 participants who underwent tau-PET with [18F]MK6240 and amyloid-PET with [18F]AZD4694, (2) 264 individuals who underwent tau-PET with [18F]Flortaucipir and amyloid-PET with [18F]Florbetapir and (3) 487 individuals who underwent lumbar puncture and amyloid-PET with [18F]Florbetapir. Using a novel analytical framework, we applied voxel-wise regression models to assess the interactive effect of APOEε4 and amyloid-β on tau load, independently of age and clinical diagnosis. We found that the interaction effect between APOEε4 and amyloid-β, rather than the sum of their independent effects, was related to increased tau load in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions. The interaction between one APOEε4 allele and amyloid-β was related to increased tau load, while the interaction between amyloid-β and two APOEε4 alleles was related to a more widespread pattern of tau aggregation. Our results contribute to an emerging framework in which the elevated risk of developing dementia conferred by APOEε4 genotype involves mechanisms associated with both amyloid-β and tau aggregation. These results may have implications for future disease-modifying therapeutic trials targeting amyloid or tau pathologies."
"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides is a major vector control strategy for malaria prevention. We evaluated the impact of a single round of IRS with the organophosphate, pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic 300CS), on entomological and parasitological parameters of malaria in Migori County, western Kenya in 2017, in an area where primary vectors are resistant to pyrethroids but susceptible to the IRS compound. Entomological monitoring was conducted by indoor CDC light trap, pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) and human landing collection (HLC) before and after IRS. The residual effect of the insecticide was assessed monthly by exposing susceptible An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu strain to sprayed surfaces in cone assays and measuring mortality at 24 hours. Malaria case burden data were extracted from laboratory records of four health facilities within the sprayed area and two adjacent unsprayed areas. IRS was associated with reductions in An. funestus numbers in the intervention areas compared to non-intervention areas by 88% with light traps (risk ratio [RR] 0.12, 95% CI 0.07–0.21, p < 0.001) and 93% with PSC collections (RR = 0.07, 0.03–0.17, p < 0.001). The corresponding reductions in the numbers of An. arabiensis collected by PSC were 69% in the intervention compared to the non-intervention areas (RR = 0.31, 0.14–0.68, p = 0.006), but there was no significant difference with light traps (RR = 0.45, 0.21–0.96, p = 0.05). Before IRS, An. funestus accounted for over 80% of Anopheles mosquitoes collected by light trap and PSC in all sites. After IRS, An. arabiensis accounted for 86% of Anopheles collected by PSC and 66% by CDC light trap in the sprayed sites while the proportion in non-intervention sites remained unchanged. No sporozoite infections were detected in intervention areas after IRS and biting rates by An. funestus were reduced to near zero. Anopheles funestus and An. arabiensis were fully susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl and resistant to pyrethroids. The residual effect of Actellic 300CS lasted ten months on mud and concrete walls. Malaria case counts among febrile patients within IRS areas was lower post- compared to pre-IRS by 44%, 65% and 47% in Rongo, Uriri and Nyatike health facilities respectively. A single application of IRS with Actellic 300CS in Migori County provided ten months protection and resulted in the near elimination of the primary malaria vector An. funestus and a corresponding reduction of malaria case count among out-patients. The impact was less on An. arabiensis, most likely due to their exophilic nature."
"The SHANK3 gene encodes a postsynaptic scaffold protein in excitatory synapses, and its disruption is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Phelan–McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Most studies of SHANK3 in the neocortex and hippocampus have focused on disturbances in pyramidal neurons. However, GABAergic interneurons likewise receive excitatory inputs and presumably would also be a target of constitutive SHANK3 perturbations. In this study, we characterize the prefrontal cortical microcircuit in awake mice using subcellular-resolution two-photon microscopy. We focused on a nonsense R1117X mutation, which leads to truncated SHANK3 and has been linked previously to cortical dysfunction. We find that R1117X mutants have abnormally elevated calcium transients in apical dendritic spines. The synaptic calcium dysregulation is due to a loss of dendritic inhibition via decreased NMDAR currents and reduced firing of dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABAergic interneurons. Notably, upregulation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in SST interneurons corrects the excessive synaptic calcium signals and ameliorates learning deficits in R1117X mutants. These findings reveal dendrite-targeting interneurons, and more broadly the inhibitory control of dendritic spines, as a key microcircuit mechanism compromised by the SHANK3 dysfunction."
"Exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC) is a spectrum of genitourinary malformations that ranges in severity and affects external genitalia and the lower urinary tract. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term sexual outcomes of patients with EEC. Sexual outcomes were hypothesized to be related to those of urinary ones. A retrospective database including all patients with EEC who had surgery at a tertiary referral institution from 1990 to 2019 was created. Data based on patient’s charts were collected: demographics, surgeries, sexual outcomes, urinary outcomes. Fifty-eight patients with EEC had surgery at tertiary referral institution and entered our database. For this analysis of sexual outcomes, a sub-set of the whole population was selected: patients being 14 years old and older, having at least one surgery at our institution and having at least 12 months of follow-up. Applying this selection criteria to our database resulted in a series of 29 patients. High rates of sexual activity were observed in pubertal and post-pubertal men (96%) and women (75%). Seventy-nine percent of men and 67% of women reported sexual satisfaction; 63% of men reported normal ejaculation. To achieve these rates, 96% of men required surgery (84% penoplasty, 52% phalloplasty), and 25% of women required introitoplasty. Fertility was achieved in 67% of men and 100% of women. Assisted reproductive technology was needed in one man. Continence rates were high (diurnal continence in 83% and nocturnal continence in 93%). However, 76% required multiple continence procedures. Men and women with EEC can have good long-term sexual and urinary outcomes, but this may require multiple surgeries. Good sexual outcomes seem to be related to good urinary and continence outcome."
"Myocardial ischemia is one of the leading health problems worldwide. Therapy consists of the restitution of coronary perfusion which is followed by myocardial inflammation. Platelet–neutrophil interaction is a crucial process during inflammation, yet its consequences are not fully understood. Here, we show that platelet–neutrophil complexes (PNCs) are increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction and that this is associated with increased levels of neuronal guidance protein semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A). To investigate this further, we injected WT animals with Sema7a and found increased infarct size with increased numbers of PNCs. Experiments in genetically modified animals identify Sema7a on red blood cells to be crucial for this condition. Further studies revealed that Sema7a interacts with the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). Treatment with anti-Sema7a antibody protected from myocardial tissue injury. In summary, we show that Sema7a binds to platelet GPIb and enhances platelet thrombo-inflammatory activity, aggravating post-ischemic myocardial tissue injury."
"Novel H1N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine have been identified in Chile co-circulating with pandemic H1N1 2009-like (A(H1N1)pdm09-like) viruses. The objective of this study was to characterize antigenically the swine H1 IAVs circulating in Chile. Genetic analysis based on the HA1 domain and antigenic analysis by hemagglutination inhibition assay were carried out. Three antigenic clusters were identified, named Chilean H1 A (ChH1A), Chilean H1 B (ChH1B), and A(H1N1)pdm09-like. The antigenic sites of ChH1A and ChH1B strains were 10–60% distant from those of commercial vaccine strains at the amino acid sequence level. Antigenic variants were identified within the clusters ChH1A and A(H1N1)pdm09-like. Substitutions in the main antigenic sites (E153G in Sa, Q193H in Sb, D168N in Ca1, P137S in Ca2, and F71L in Cb) were detected in variants from the ChH1A cluster, whereas only a single substitution in antigenic site Sa (G155E) was detected in variants from A(H1N1)pdm09-like cluster, which confirms the importance to carrying out antigenic analyses in addition to genetic analyses to evaluate control measures such as vaccination. These results highlight the need to update vaccines for swine in Chile and the importance of continued surveillance to determine the onward transmission of antigenic variants in Chilean pig populations."
"Development of tau-based therapies for Alzheimer’s disease requires an understanding of the timing of disease-related changes in tau. We quantified the phosphorylation state at multiple sites of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid markers across four decades of disease progression in dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease. We identified a pattern of tau staging where site-specific phosphorylation changes occur at different periods of disease progression and follow distinct trajectories over time. These tau phosphorylation state changes are uniquely associated with structural, metabolic, neurodegenerative and clinical markers of disease, and some (p-tau217 and p-tau181) begin with the initial increases in aggregate amyloid-β as early as two decades before the development of aggregated tau pathology. Others (p-tau205 and t-tau) increase with atrophy and hypometabolism closer to symptom onset. These findings provide insights into the pathways linking tau, amyloid-β and neurodegeneration, and may facilitate clinical trials of tau-based treatments."
"BackgroundThe optimal EBRT schedule for MSCC is undetermined. Our aim was to determine whether a single fraction (SF) was non-inferior to five daily fractions (5Fx), for functional motor outcome.MethodsPatients not proceeding with surgical decompression in this multicentre non-inferiority, Phase 3 trial were randomised to 10 Gy/SF or 20 Gy/5Fx. A change in mobility from baseline to 5 weeks for each patient, was evaluated by a Modified Tomita score: 1 = ‘Walk unaided’, 2 = ‘With walking aid’ and 3 = ‘Bed-bound’. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was a detrimental change of −0.4 in the mean difference between arms.ResultsOne-hundred and twelve eligible patients were enrolled. Seventy-three patients aged 30–87 were evaluated for the primary analysis. The 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in mobility scores between arms was −0.12 to 0.6. Since −0.4 is not included in the interval, there is evidence that 10 Gy/SF is non-inferior to 20 Gy/5Fx. One grade 3 AE was reported in the 5Fx arm. Twelve (26%) patients in the 5Fx arm had a Grade 2–3 AE compared with six (11%) patients in the SF arm (p = 0.093).ConclusionFor mobility preservation, one 10-Gy fraction is non-inferior to 20 Gy in five fractions, in patients with MSCC not proceeding with surgical decompression.Clinical Trial RegistrationCancer Trials Ireland ICORG 05-03; NCT00968643; EU-20952."
"Salmonella enterica is the second most reported bacterial cause of food-borne infections in Europe. Therefore molecular surveillance activities based on pathogen subtyping are an important measure of controlling Salmonellosis by public health agencies. In Germany, at the federal level, this work is carried out by the National Reference Center for Salmonella and other Bacterial Enteric Pathogens (NRC). With rise of next generation sequencing techniques, the NRC has introduced whole-genome-based typing methods for S. enterica in 2016. In this study we report on the feasibility of genome-based in silico serotyping in the German setting using raw sequence reads. We found that SeqSero and seven gene MLST showed 98% and 95% concordance, respectively, with classical serotyping for the here evaluated serotypes, including the most common German serotypes S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium as well as less frequently found serotypes. The level of concordance increased to >99% when the results of both in silico methods were combined. However, both tools exhibited misidentification of monophasic variants, in particular monophasic S. Typhimurium and therefore need to be fine-tuned for reliable detection of this epidemiologically important variant. We conclude that with adjustments Salmonella genome-based serotyping might become the new gold standard."
"Lineage plasticity, the ability of cells to transition from one committed developmental pathway to another, has been proposed as a source of intratumoural heterogeneity and of tumour adaptation to an adverse tumour microenvironment including exposure to targeted anticancer treatments. Tumour cell conversion into a different histological subtype has been associated with a loss of dependency on the original oncogenic driver, leading to therapeutic resistance. A well-known pathway of lineage plasticity in cancer — the histological transformation of adenocarcinomas to aggressive neuroendocrine derivatives — was initially described in lung cancers harbouring an EGFR mutation, and was subsequently reported in multiple other adenocarcinomas, including prostate cancer in the presence of antiandrogens. Squamous transformation is a subsequently identified and less well-characterized pathway of adenocarcinoma escape from suppressive anticancer therapy. The increased practice of tumour re-biopsy upon disease progression has increased the recognition of these mechanisms of resistance and has improved our understanding of the underlying biology. In this Review, we provide an overview of the impact of lineage plasticity on cancer progression and therapy resistance, with a focus on neuroendocrine transformation in lung and prostate tumours. We discuss the current understanding of the molecular drivers of this phenomenon, emerging management strategies and open questions in the field."
"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disease causing life-threatening multi-organ dysfunction. Accumulating evidences suggest that two forms of programmed necrosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis triggered by the pathogen component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines, play important roles in the development of bacterial sepsis-induced shock and tissue injury. Sepsis-induced shock and tissue injury required receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) phosphorylation, caspase11 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. However, the synergistic effect of necroptosis and pyroptosis in the pathological progress of sepsis remains elusive. In this study, we found that blockage of both necroptosis and pyroptosis (double deletion of Ripk3/Gsdmd or Mlkl/Gsdmd) resulted in accumulative protection against septic shock, systemic blood clotting and multi-organ injury in mice. Bone marrow transplantation confirmed that necroptosis and pyroptosis in both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells are indispensable in the progression of sepsis-induced multi-organ injury. Both RIPK3 and GSDMD signaling collaborated to amplify necroinflammation and tissue factor release in macrophages and endothelial cells, which led to tissue injury. Furthermore, cell death induced by inflammatory cytokines and high-mobility group box 1 could be prevented by double ablation of Ripk3/Gsdmd or Mlkl/Gsdmd, suggesting that a positive feedback loop interconnecting RIPK3/MLKL and GSDMD machinery and inflammation facilitated sepsis progression. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that RIPK3-mediated necroptosis and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis collaborated to amply inflammatory signaling and enhance tissue injury in the process of sepsis, which may shed new light on two potential targets of combined therapeutic interventions for this highly lethal disorder."
"Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are high-fidelity in vivo tumor models that accurately reflect many key aspects of human cancer. In contrast to cancer cell lines or genetically engineered mouse models, the utility of PDXs has been limited by the inability to perform targeted genome editing of these tumors. To address this limitation, we have developed methods for CRISPR-Cas9 editing of PDXs using a tightly regulated, inducible Cas9 vector that does not require in vitro culture for selection of transduced cells. We demonstrate the utility of this platform in PDXs to analyze genetic dependencies by targeted gene disruption and to analyze mechanisms of acquired drug resistance by site-specific gene editing, using templated homology-directed repair. This flexible system has broad application to other explant models and substantially augments the utility of PDXs as genetically programmable models of human cancer."
"Prolonged cell survival occurs through the expression of specific protein isoforms generated by alternate splicing of mRNA precursors in cancer cells. How alternate splicing regulates tumor development and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we show that RNF113A, whose loss-of-function causes the X-linked trichothiodystrophy, is overexpressed in lung cancer and protects from Cisplatin-dependent cell death. RNF113A is a RNA-binding protein which regulates the splicing of multiple candidates involved in cell survival. RNF113A deficiency triggers cell death upon DNA damage through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis via the destabilization of the prosurvival protein MCL-1, ferroptosis due to enhanced SAT1 expression, and increased production of ROS due to altered Noxa1 expression. RNF113A deficiency circumvents the resistance to Cisplatin and to BCL-2 inhibitors through the destabilization of MCL-1, which thus defines spliceosome inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat tumors showing acquired resistance to specific drugs due to MCL-1 stabilization."
"It is unknown whether early diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) can enable earlier management and improve outcomes. We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from the TEMPO 3:4 trial. Subjects were stratified by ADPKD diagnosis at age ≤18 (childhood diagnosis [CD]) or>18 (adulthood diagnosis [AD]). Groups were compared for baseline characteristics and total kidney volume (TKV) growth and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 3 years. 294 CD and 1148 AD subjects were analyzed. At inclusion, CD subjects were younger (mean age 34.2 versus 39.8 years; p < 0.0001) and had better eGFR (mean ± SD 87.4 ± 23.9 versus 80.1 ± 20.7 mL/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.0001), while CD had more severe Mayo risk classification (p < 0.0001) and more PKD1 mutations (p = 0.003). No statistical differences were found in TKV or eGFR change. At study end, placebo-treated CD subjects had better eGFR than projected by a prediction equation (mean difference ±SD for observed versus predicted eGFR: 2.18 ± 10.7 mL/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.0475). However, these results are not confirmed when excluding stage 1 CKD. Whether CD subjects, despite their risk profile, have a slower disease course than predicted remains inconclusive. Future studies are needed to confirm that early diagnosis and management can alter the disease course of ADPKD."
"The DJ-1 gene, a causative gene for familial Parkinson’s disease (PD), has been reported to have various functions, including transcriptional regulation, antioxidant response, and chaperone and protease functions; however, the molecular mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of PD remains elusive. To further explore the molecular function of DJ-1 in the pathogenesis of PD, we compared protein expression profiles in brain tissues from wild-type and DJ-1-deficient mice. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis analysis and subsequent analysis using data mining methods revealed alterations in the expression of molecules associated with energy production. We demonstrated that DJ-1 deletion inhibited S-nitrosylation of endogenous Parkin as well as overexpressed Parkin in neuroblastoma cells and mouse brain tissues. Thus, we used genome editing to generate neuroblastoma cells with DJ-1 deletion or S-nitrosylated cysteine mutation in Parkin and demonstrated that these cells exhibited similar phenotypes characterized by enhancement of cell death under mitochondrial depolarization and dysfunction of mitochondria. Our data indicate that DJ-1 is required for the S-nitrosylation of Parkin, which positively affects mitochondrial function, and suggest that the denitrosylation of Parkin via DJ-1 inactivation might contribute to PD pathogenesis and act as a therapeutic target."
"Portal vein ligation (PVL) induces liver growth prior to resection. Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation (PVL plus transection=ALPPS) or the addition of the prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) to PVL both accelerate growth via stabilization of HIF-α subunits. This study aims at clarifying the crosstalk of hepatocytes (HC), hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in accelerated liver growth. In vivo, liver volume, HC proliferation, vascular density and HSC activation were assessed in PVL, ALPPS, PVL+DMOG and DMOG alone. Proliferation of HC, HSC and LSEC was determined under DMOG in vitro. Conditioned media experiments of DMOG-exposed cells were performed. ALPPS and PVL+DMOG accelerated liver growth and HC proliferation in comparison to PVL. DMOG alone did not induce HC proliferation, but led to increased vascular density, which was also observed in ALPPS and PVL+DMOG. Activated HSC were detected in ALPPS, PVL+DMOG and DMOG, again not in PVL. In vitro, DMOG had no proliferative effect on HC, but conditioned supernatant of DMOG-treated HSC induced VEGF-dependent proliferation of LSEC. Transcriptome analysis confirmed activation of proangiogenic factors in hypoxic HSC. Hypoxia signaling in HSC induces VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. HSC play a crucial role in the cellular crosstalk of rapid liver regeneration."
"T-cell-secreted interferon (IFN)-γ can exert pleiotropic effects on tumor cells that include induction of immune checkpoints and antigen presentation machinery components, and inhibition of cell growth. Despite its role as a key effector molecule, little is known about the spatiotemporal spreading of IFN-γ secreted by activated CD8+ T cells within the tumor environment. Using multiday intravital imaging, we demonstrate that T cell recognition of a minor fraction of tumor cells leads to sensing of IFN-γ by a large part of the tumor mass. Furthermore, imaging of tumors in which antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor cells are separated in space reveals spreading of the IFN-γ response, reaching distances of >800 µm. Notably, long-range sensing of IFN-γ can modify tumor behavior, as shown by both induction of PD-L1 expression and inhibition of tumor growth. Collectively, these data reveal how, through IFN-γ, CD8+ T cells modulate the behavior of remote tumor cells, including antigen-loss variants."
"Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) has manifestation through the exfoliation of epidermis and mucosal tissue. Ocular surface is usually affected in acute and chronic stage. The patients are usually suffered from chronic ocular sequelae including symblepharon, limbal stem cell deficiency, etc. Furthermore, ocular microbiome may also be altered in SJS. This is prospective, age and sex matched analytical study which including 20 chronic SJS patients and 20 healthy subjects for specimen collection from inferior conjunctiva for microbiome analysis by conventional cultures and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. Significant higher proportion of positive-cultured specimen was demonstrated in SJS group (SJS group 60%, healthy 10%, p-value = 0.001). In addition, NGS which providing high-throughput sequencing has demonstrated the greater diversity of microbial species. The higher proportion of pathogenic microorganisms including Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp. was shown in SJS group. Ocular surface in SJS is usually occupied by more diverse microorganisms with increased proportion of pathogenic species. This condition may affect chronic inflammation and opportunistic infections in SJS group. In order to prevent and treat infection in these patients, appropriate antibiotics based on bacterial examination should be considered as the first-line treatment in the SJS patients."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. The estimation of ASD severity is very important in clinical practice due to providing a more elaborate diagnosis. Although several studies have revealed some resting-state functional connectivities (RSFCs) that are related to the ASD severity, they have all been based on small-sample data and local RSFCs. The aim of the present study is to adopt multivariate pattern analysis to investigate a subset of connectivities among whole-brain RSFCs that are more contributive to ASD severity estimation based on large-sample data. Regression estimation shows a Pearson correlation value of 0.5 between the estimated and observed severity, with a mean absolute error of 1.41. The results provide obvious evidence that some RSFCs undergo notable alterations with the severity of ASD. More importantly, these selected RSFCs have an abnormality in the connection modes of the inter-network and intra-network connections. In addition, these selected abnormal RSFCs are mainly associated with the sensorimotor network, the default mode network, and inter-hemispheric connectivities, while exhibiting significant left hemisphere lateralization. Overall, this study indicates that some RSFCs suffer from abnormal alterations in patients with ASD, providing additional evidence of large-scale functional network alterations in ASD."
"Adherence to cardioprotective medications following myocardial infarction (MI) is commonly assessed using a binary threshold of 80%. We investigated the relationship between medication adherence as a continuous measure and outcomes in MI survivors using restricted cubic splines (RCS). We identified all patients aged ≥65 years hospitalised for MI from 2003–2008 who survived one-year post-discharge (n = 5938). Adherence to statins, beta-blockers, renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) and clopidogrel was calculated using proportion of days covered to one-year post-discharge (landmark date). Outcomes were 1-year all-cause death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after the landmark date. Adherence-outcome associations were estimated from RCS Cox regression models. RCS analyses indicated decreasing risk for both outcomes above 60% adherence for statins, RASI and clopidogrel, with each 10% increase in adherence associated with a 13.9%, 12.1% and 18.0% decrease respectively in adjusted risk of all-cause death (all p < 0.02). Similar results were observed for MACE (all p < 0.03). Beta-blockers had no effect on outcomes at any level of adherence. In MI survivors, increasing adherence to statins, RASI, and clopidogrel, but not beta blockers, is associated with a decreasing risk of death/MACE with no adherence threshold beyond 60%. Medication adherence should be considered as a continuous measure in outcomes analyses."
"Gangliosides are structurally and functionally polymorphic sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are widely distributed in the human body. They play important roles in protecting us against immune attacks, yet they can become targets for autoimmunity and act as receptors for microbes, like the influenza viruses, and toxins, such as the cholera toxin. The expression patterns of gangliosides vary in different tissues, during different life periods, as well as in different animals. Antibodies against gangliosides (AGA) can target immune attack e.g., against neuronal cells and neutralize their complement inhibitory activity. AGAs are important especially in acquired demyelinating immune-mediated neuropathies, like Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variant, the Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS). They can emerge in response to different microbial agents and immunological insults. Thereby, they can be involved in a variety of diseases. In addition, antibodies against GM3 were found in the sera of patients vaccinated with Pandemrix®, who developed secondary narcolepsy, strongly supporting the autoimmune etiology of the disease."
"This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms responsible for heteroresistance to colistin in Acinetobactor baumannii clinical isolates from a Chinese teaching hospital. Five hundred and seventy-six nonduplicate A. baumannii clinical isolates isolated from 2014 to 2015 were tested. Colistin heteroresistance was determined using population analysis profiles (PAPs). Susceptibility testing was conducted using the broth microdilution method (BMD). The ability to form biofilm formation was determined using 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates. Time-kill assays were also conducted. PCR and sequencing were used to detect the presence of resistant genes. Expression levels of efflux pump genes were determined by qRT-PCR. LPS analysis was conducted by SDS-PAGE. Lipid A characteristic were determined via MALDI-TOF MS. Nine colistin heteroresistant A. baumannii clinical isolates which were selected by PAPs, exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The microplate biofilm assay revealed that colistin heteroresistant A. baumannii clinical isolates had weaker biofilm formation capacity than A. baumannii ATCC19606. Colistin-heteroresistant A. baumannii isolates exhibited regrowth after 12 h at 0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, and 2 × MIC. The results of PCR and sequencing revealed mutations of lpxACD in some colistin heteroresistant A. baumannii isolates. qRT-PCR also showed that the expressions of efflux pump genes were upregulated in some of the heteroresistant isolates. Our study was the first report of colistin heteroresistant A. baumannii clinical isolates in China. The transition of colistin heteroresistance to resistance should be of concern in future clinical surveillance."
"Stimuli-responsive biomaterials that contain logic gates hold great potential for detecting and responding to pathological markers as part of clinical therapies. However, a major barrier is the lack of a generalized system that can be used to easily assemble different ligand-responsive units to form programmable nanodevices for advanced biocomputation. Here we develop a programmable polymer library by including responsive units in building blocks with similar structure and reactivity. Using these polymers, we have developed a series of smart nanocarriers with hierarchical structures containing logic gates linked to self-immolative motifs. Designed with disease biomarkers as inputs, our logic devices showed site-specific release of multiple therapeutics (including kinase inhibitors, drugs and short interfering RNA) in vitro and in vivo. We expect that this ‘plug and play’ platform will be expanded towards smart biomaterial engineering for therapeutic delivery, precision medicine, tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

"ObjectiveTo compare skin-to-skin care (SSC) and oral sucrose for preterm neonatal pain control.MethodsPreterm neonates (28–36 weeks gestation) requiring heel-stick were eligible. In group-A, SSC was given 15-min before first heel-stick, and sucrose was given 2-min before second heel-stick. In group-B, the sequence was reversed. Blinded premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score assessment was done at 0, 1, and 5-min of heel-stick by two assessors.ResultsA hundred neonates were enrolled. The inter-rater agreement for the PIPP score was good. The behavior state component was significantly lower in the sucrose group at all assessment points. The mean (SD) difference between 1-min and 0 min was similar [SSC 3.58(3.16) vs. sucrose 4.09(3.82), p = 0.24] between groups. The PIPP score attained baseline values at 5-min in both groups.ConclusionAlbeit sucrose indicated instantaneous action, SSC and sucrose have comparable clinical efficacy for preterm neonatal pain control. Multisensory stimulation with SSC may result in a higher behavioral state component of the PIPP score."
"Hypertension poorly responsive to medications is defined resistant hypertension. We have previously shown that 1-year of guided walking is followed by highly significant reduction of systolic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. Aim of this study was to assess the effect of a 1-year of guided walking on the blood pressure of sedentary hypertensive subjects including patients with resistant hypertension. Two hundred and fifty-nine sedentary subjects with systolic pressure ≥130 mmHg were subdivided in a group without blood pressure medications and in a group taking three or more antihypertensive drugs, including diuretics. Blood pressure, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and walking speed were determined at enrollment and after 1-year of walking, supervised by exercise physiologists. At baseline, systolic pressure was significantly higher in the subjects under therapy (144.6 ± 12.2 vs. 140.2 ± 10.7). Two hundred and three subjects (124 without and 79 with therapy) completed the program. During the 1-year program each subject walked ~220 h. After 1-year a significant decrease (P < 0.0001) of systolic pressure was observed in both groups. The decrease was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the subjects under therapy. The decrease of systolic pressure was directly proportional to baseline values. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups. In conclusion, habitual walking may lead to clinically significant reductions of blood pressure in therapy resistant hypertensive subjects."
ObjectiveTo assess whether in very preterm infants (1) body mass index (BMI) Z-score and weight-for-length (WtFL) Z-score at 1 year of age and (2) head growth from discharge to 1 year are associated with breastfeeding at discharge and the age of onset and type of complementary foods.Study designObservational cohort study.ResultsInfants started on only ready-made complementary (RMC) feedings at ≤26 weeks adjusted age had the highest adjusted BMI Z-score and WtFL Z-score at 1 year of age. Adjusted change in fronto-occipital circumference was highest in infants either discharged on breastmilk or receiving home-made complementary food with/without RMC (HMM) at ≤26 weeks adjusted age.ConclusionsInfants started on RMC ≤26 weeks adjusted age had the highest BMI Z-score and WtFL Z-score at 1 year. Head growth from discharge to 1 year was highest in infants either discharged on breastmilk or receiving HMM at ≤26 weeks adjusted age.
"BackgroundBlack men have significantly higher incidence and are up to three times more likely to die of prostate cancer (PCa) than White men. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy (FBx) has emerged as a promising modality for the detection of PCa. The goal of our study is to identify differences in utilization of FBx between Black and White men presenting with suspicion of PCa.MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of Black and White men who presented with suspicion of PCa and required biopsy from January 2014 to December 2018. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to study the influence of race on the utilization of FBx.ResultsSix hundred nineteen (Black: 182, White: 437) men were included in the study. Forty-one out of 182 (22.5%) Black men underwent FBx compared with 225/437 (51.5%) of White men (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, race, prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal exam, family history of PCa and health insurance provider, Black race was found to be a significant negative predictor of obtaining FBx (OR:0.32, 95% CI: 0.21–0.51, P < 0.001). Black race stayed an independent negative predictor (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.20–0.64, P < 0.001) in the cohort of patients who were biopsy naïve; however, although reduced, there was no significant difference in the cohort with a prior negative biopsy (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.19–1.36, P = 0.179).ConclusionsAlthough FBx is a superior modality for early detection of PCa, we found that Black men were less likely to undergo FBx when presenting with PCa suspicion. Further investigation is needed to evaluate if this difference is patient preference or if there are underlying socioeconomic, cultural or provider biases influencing this disparity."
"Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are at increased risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anal cancer. Given the “field effect” of HPV pathogenesis, some recommend that anal cancer screening should be limited to WLHIV with prior genital disease. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between anal and genital disease in WLHIV in order to better inform anal cancer screening guidelines. We retrospectively studied 153 WLHIV with biopsy-proven anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (AHSIL) and long-term evaluable cervical/vaginal/vulvar histopathology. Based on the absence or presence of genital HSIL, subjects were categorized as having isolated AHSIL or multicentric HSIL. Demographics, HIV parameters and cervical/anal HPV status were recorded. Chi-square test was used for bivariate analyses. Of 153 WLHIV with AHSIL, 110 (72%) had isolated AHSIL, while 43 (28%) had multicentric HSIL (28 cervical, 16 vulvar, and 8 vaginal HSIL). The median genital surveillance was 8 years (range 1–27). Cervical HPV16/18 infection was associated with multicentric disease (P = 0.001). Overall, 53% of multicentric cases presented genital HSIL preceding AHSIL with median interval 13 years (range 2–23). Paired anal and cervical high-risk HPV results were available for 60 women within 12 months of AHSIL diagnosis: 30 (50%) had anal infection alone, while 30 (50%) had anal/cervical coinfection by 16/18 (15%), non-16/18 (13%), or different types (22%). In conclusion, WLHIV frequently develop AHSILs without pre-existing genital disease or after long latency following a genital HSIL diagnosis. Our findings support anal cancer screening for WLHIV irrespective of prior genital disease."
"Doxycycline has anti-tumour effects in a range of tumour systems. The aims of this study were to define the role mitochondria play in this process and examine the potential of doxycycline in combination with gemcitabine. We studied the adenocarcinoma cell line A549, its mitochondrial DNA-less derivative A549 ρ° and cultured fibroblasts. Treatment with doxycycline for 5 days resulted in a decrease of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, respiration and membrane potential, and an increase of reactive oxygen species in A549 cells and fibroblasts, but fibroblasts were less affected. Doxycycline slowed proliferation of A549 cells by 35%. Cellular ATP levels did not change. Doxycycline alone had no effect on apoptosis; however, in combination with gemcitabine given during the last 2 days of treatment, doxycycline increased caspase 9 and 3/7 activities, resulting in a further decrease of surviving A549 cells by 59% and of fibroblasts by 24% compared to gemcitabine treatment alone. A549 ρ° cells were not affected by doxycycline. Key effects of doxycycline observed in A549 cells, such as the decrease of mitochondrial-encoded proteins and surviving cells were also seen in the cancer cell lines COLO357 and HT29. Our results suggest that doxycycline suppresses cancer cell proliferation and primes cells for apoptosis by gemcitabine."
"For successful tracheal reconstruction, tissue-engineered artificial trachea should meet several requirements, such as biocompatible constructs comparable to natural trachea, coverage with ciliated respiratory mucosa, and adequate cartilage remodeling to support a cylindrical structure. Here, we designed an artificial trachea with mechanical properties similar to the native trachea that can enhance the regeneration of tracheal mucosa and cartilage through the optimal combination of a two-layered tubular scaffold and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells. The framework of the artificial trachea was fabricated with electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers (inner) and 3D-printed PCL microfibers (outer). Also, human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs), iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs), and iPSC-derived chondrocytes (iPSC-Chds) were used to maximize the regeneration of tracheal mucosa and cartilage in vivo. After 2 days of cultivation using a bioreactor system, tissue-engineered artificial tracheas were transplanted into a segmental trachea defect (1.5-cm length) rabbit model. Endoscopy did not reveal granulation ingrowth into tracheal lumen. Alcian blue staining clearly showed the formation of ciliated columnar epithelium in iPSC-MSC groups. In addition, micro-CT analysis showed that iPSC-Chd groups were effective in forming neocartilage at defect sites. Therefore, this study describes a promising approach for long-term functional reconstruction of a segmental tracheal defect."
"Background/objectivesA higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been shown to be protective against obesity in adults, but the evidence is still inconclusive in children at early ages. Our objective was to explore the association between adherence to Mediterranean Diet at the age of 4 and the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity at 4 years of age, and incidence at the age of 8.Subjects/methodsWe analyzed data from children of the INMA cohort study who attended follow-up visits at age 4 and 8 years (n = 1801 and n = 1527, respectively). Diet was assessed at the age of 4 using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The adherence to MD was evaluated by the relative Mediterranean diet (rMED) score, and categorized as low (0–6), medium (7–10), and high (11–16). Overweight and obesity were defined according to the age-sex specific BMI cutoffs proposed by the International Obesity Task Force, and abdominal obesity as waist circumference >90th percentile. We used Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios at 4 years of age, and Cox regression analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HR) from 4–8 years of age.ResultsIn cross-sectional analyses at the age of 4 no association was observed between adherence to MD and overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. In longitudinal analyses, a high adherence to MD at age 4 was associated with lower incidence of overweight (HR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21–0.67; p = 0.001), obesity (HR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05–0.53; p = 0.002), and abdominal obesity (HR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12–0.73; p = 0.008) at the age of 8.ConclusionThis study shows that a high adherence to MD at the age of 4 is associated with a lower risk of developing overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity at age 8. If these results are confirmed by other studies, MD may be recommended to reduce the incidence of obesity at early ages."
"Co-inhibitory pathways have a fundamental function in regulating T cell responses and control the balance between promoting efficient effector functions and restricting immune pathology. The TIGIT pathway has been implicated in promoting T cell dysfunction in chronic viral infection. Importantly, TIGIT signaling is functionally linked to IL-10 expression, which has an effect on both virus control and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, whether TIGIT has a function in viral persistence or limiting tissue pathology is unclear. Here we report that TIGIT modulation effectively alters the phenotype and cytokine profile of T cells during influenza and chronic LCMV infection, but does not affect virus control in vivo. Instead, TIGIT has an important effect in limiting immune pathology in peripheral organs by inducing IL-10. Our data therefore identify a function of TIGIT in limiting immune pathology that is independent of viral clearance."
"Reconstructive surgery of the penis holds many unique challenges due to the unique physiological properties of the tissues. Much of the effort involved therefore goes to preserving as much of the native tissue as possible whilst novel and creative methods have been adopted to repair defects and in creation of neophallus. A search of the PubMed database was carried out using the following keywords: ‘penile trauma’, ‘penile cancer’, ‘lichen sclerosus’, ‘glansectomy’, ‘glans resurfacing’, ‘penile-sparing surgery’, ‘micropenis’, ‘aphallia’, ‘female-to-male sex reassignment surgery’, ‘scrotal flap’ and ‘genital lymphoedema’. Results for glans resurfacing in treating cancer showed low local recurrence rates at 0–10% whilst 90% of lichen sclerosus patients reported complete resolutions of pain and pruritis. For repairs of penile shaft skin defects the literature supports the use of full-thickness skin graft and pedicled scrotal flaps. The radial artery-based forearm free flap remains the best option for neophallus creation in terms of function, sensation and cosmesis but unfortunately leaves a disfiguring scar and involves multiple stages. Some novel techniques have been developed to circumvent these issues and are discussed. This article presents an update on the important developments in the field of penile reconstructive surgery."
"Background/objectivesThe purpose of this study was to examine the association between muscle weakness and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and whether the association is partly explained by insulin resistance or inflammation.Subjects/methodsSubjects were 3922 adults who participated in the 2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Relative grip strength (rGS; calculated as maximal grip strength divided by BMI) was used to predict NAFLD defined by NAFLD liver fat score. Participants were classified into four groups according to the quartiles of rGS distribution (Q1–Q4). Insulin resistance was assessed by triglycerides and glucose (TyG) index. Inflammation was measured with C-reactive protein (CRP). Fibrosis was assessed by the Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and the NAFLD fibrosis score.ResultsrGS had significant negative associations with TyG index and CRP (all p < 0.001). rGS was a significant predictor of NAFLD (OR, 0.54–0.19 in Q2–Q4 men; OR, 0.54–0.08 in Q2–Q4 women, all p < 0.001). Adjustment for other participant factors did not substantially affect the results. Addition of TyG index changed the estimates for NAFLD slightly and addition of CRP increased the ORs by 10–20% in Q3–Q4 women. In the subpopulation with NAFLD (n = 946), rGS showed strong inverse relationships with FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score (all p < 0.001).ConclusionsGrip strength was inversely associated not only with the risk of NAFLD but also with its severity. Insulin resistance and inflammation explained only a small portion of the association between grip strength and NAFLD risk."
"To quantify and compare 9-year all-cause mortality risk attributable to modifiable risk factors among older English and Brazilian adults. We used data for participants aged 60 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Bagé Cohort Study of Ageing (SIGa-Bagé). The five modifiable risk factors assessed at baseline were smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Deaths were identified through linkage to mortality registers. For each risk factor, estimated all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HR) and population attributable fractions (PAF) were adjusted by age, sex, all other risk factors and socioeconomic position (wealth) using Cox proportional hazards modelling. We also quantified the risk factor adjusted wealth gradients in mortality, by age and sex. Among the participants, 659 (ELSA) and 638 (SIGa-Bagé) died during the 9-year follow-up. Mortality rates were higher in SIGa-Bagé. HRs and PAFs showed more similarities than differences, with physical inactivity (PAF 16.5% ELSA; 16.7% SIGa-Bagé) and current smoking (PAF 4.9% for both cohorts) having the strongest association. A clear graded relationship existed between the number of risk factors and subsequent mortality. Wealth gradients in mortality were apparent in both cohorts after full adjustment, especially among men aged 60–74 in ELSA. A different pattern was found among older women, especially in SIGa-Bagé. These findings call attention for the challenge to health systems to prevent and modify the major risk factors related to non-communicable diseases, especially physical inactivity and smoking. Furthermore, wealth inequalities in mortality persist among older adults."
"Patients with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) frequently manifest comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms with depression and anxiety being most frequent, and individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased prevalence of LOAD. This suggests shared etiologies and intersecting pathways between LOAD and MDD. We performed pleiotropy analyses using LOAD and MDD GWAS data sets from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), respectively. We found a moderate enrichment for SNPs associated with LOAD across increasingly stringent levels of significance with the MDD GWAS association (LOAD|MDD), of maximum four and eightfolds, including and excluding the APOE-region, respectively. Association analysis excluding the APOE-region identified numerous SNPs corresponding to 40 genes, 9 of which are known LOAD-risk loci primarily in chromosome 11 regions that contain the SPI1 gene and MS4A genes cluster, and others were novel pleiotropic risk-loci for LOAD conditional with MDD. The most significant associated SNPs on chromosome 11 overlapped with eQTLs found in whole-blood and monocytes, suggesting functional roles in gene regulation. The reverse conditional association analysis (MDD|LOAD) showed a moderate level, ~sevenfold, of polygenic overlap, however, no SNP showed significant association. Pathway analyses replicated previously reported LOAD biological pathways related to immune response and regulation of endocytosis. In conclusion, we provide insights into the overlapping genetic signatures underpinning the common phenotypic manifestations and inter-relationship between LOAD and MDD. This knowledge is crucial to the development of actionable targets for novel therapies to treat depression preceding dementia, in an effort to delay or ultimately prevent the onset of LOAD."
"Visceral obesity is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whereas gut dysbiosis appears to be instrumental for this relationship, whether gut-associated signatures translocate to extra-intestinal tissues and how this affects host metabolism remain elusive. Here we provide a comparative analysis of the microbial profile found in plasma, liver and in three distinct adipose tissues of individuals with morbid obesity. We explored how these tissue microbial signatures vary between individuals with normoglycaemia and those with T2D that were matched for body mass index. We identified tissue-specific signatures with higher bacterial load in the liver and omental adipose tissue. Gut commensals, but also environmental bacteria, showed tissue- and T2D-specific compartmentalisation. T2D signatures were most evident in mesenteric adipose tissue, in which individuals with diabetes displayed reduced bacterial diversity concomitant with fewer Gram-positive bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, as opposed to enhanced levels of typically opportunistic Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. Plasma samples of individuals with diabetes were similarly enriched in Enterobacteriaceae, including the pathobiont Escherichia–Shigella. Our work provides evidence for the presence of selective plasma and tissue microbial signatures in individuals with severe obesity and identifies new potential microbial targets and biomarkers of T2D."
"Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is increasingly widespread in medical and commercial devices, necessitating the development of automated interpretation strategies. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm irregularities1. However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human eye2,3. Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks4,5. However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG6 is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing misclassification exist."
"BackgroundPrevious studies suggested that mdivi-1 (mitochondrial division inhibitor), a putative inhibitor of dynamin-related protein (DRP1), decreased cancer cell proliferation through inducing mitochondrial fusion and altering oxygen consumption. However, the metabolic reprogramming underlying the DRP1 inhibition is still unclear in cancer cells.MethodsTo better understand the metabolic effect of DRP1 inhibition, [U-13C]glucose isotope tracing was employed to assess mdivi-1 effects in several cancer cell lines, DRP1-WT (wild-type) and DRP1-KO (knockout) H460 lung cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).ResultsMitochondrial staining confirmed that mdivi-1 treatment and DRP1 deficiency induced mitochondrial fusion. Surprisingly, metabolic isotope tracing found that mdivi-1 decreased mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the lung cancer cell lines H460, A549 and the colon cancer cell line HCT116. [U-13C]glucose tracing studies also showed that the TCA cycle intermediates had significantly lower enrichment in mdivi-1-treated cells. In comparison, DRP1-WT and DRP1-KO H460 cells had similar oxidative metabolism, which was decreased by mdivi-1 treatment. Furthermore, mdivi-1-mediated effects on oxidative metabolism were independent of mitochondrial fusion.ConclusionsOur data suggest that, in cancer cells, mdivi-1, a putative inhibitor of DRP1, decreases oxidative metabolism to impair cell proliferation."
ObjectiveTo evaluate associations between maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy and hypoglycemia in term neonates.Study designWe conducted a prospective comparative cohort study of neonates of ≥37 weeks’ gestation. Neonates whose mothers used antidepressants during pregnancy were compared with randomly selected cohort of neonates whose mothers did not use antidepressants. Blood glucose was measured at 24 ± 2 h after birth. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose level <2.6 mmol/L. We needed 60 patients in each group to reject the null hypothesis.ResultsMean gestational ages were 39 vs. 40 weeks (p < 0.01) and birthweights were 3250 vs. 3360 g (p = 0.08) for antidepressant-exposed vs. -unexposed neonates. There were no significant differences between groups in odds of hypoglycemia (4/59: exposed vs. 2/61: unexposed; adjusted relative risk 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–8.92) or mean blood glucose levels.ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with neonatal hypoglycemia at 24 h of age.
"Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) expression has been linked to tumor progression in various cancer types, but the detailed mechanisms of TNFAIP8 are not fully elucidated. Here we define the role of TNFAIP8 in early events associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increased TNFAIP8 levels in HCC cells enhanced cell survival by blocking apoptosis, rendering HCC cells more resistant to the anticancer drugs, sorafenib and regorafenib. TNFAIP8 also induced autophagy and steatosis in liver cancer cells. Consistent with these observations, TNFAIP8 blocked AKT/mTOR signaling and showed direct interaction with ATG3-ATG7 proteins. TNFAIP8 also exhibited binding with fatty acids and modulated expression of lipid/fatty-acid metabolizing enzymes. Chronic feeding of mice with alcohol increased hepatic levels of TNFAIP8, autophagy, and steatosis but not in high-fat-fed obese mice. Similarly, higher TNFAIP8 expression was associated with steatotic livers of human patients with a history of alcohol use but not in steatotic patients with no history of alcohol use. Our data indicate a novel role of TNFAIP8 in modulation of drug resistance, autophagy, and hepatic steatosis, all key early events in HCC progression."
"The gastrointestinal tract is the only internal organ to have evolved with its own independent nervous system, known as the enteric nervous system (ENS). This Review provides an update on advances that have been made in our understanding of how neurons within the ENS coordinate sensory and motor functions. Understanding this function is critical for determining how deficits in neurogenic motor patterns arise. Knowledge of how distension or chemical stimulation of the bowel evokes sensory responses in the ENS and central nervous system have progressed, including critical elements that underlie the mechanotransduction of distension-evoked colonic peristalsis. Contrary to original thought, evidence suggests that mucosal serotonin is not required for peristalsis or colonic migrating motor complexes, although it can modulate their characteristics. Chemosensory stimuli applied to the lumen can release substances from enteroendocrine cells, which could subsequently modulate ENS activity. Advances have been made in optogenetic technologies, such that specific neurochemical classes of enteric neurons can be stimulated. A major focus of this Review will be the latest advances in our understanding of how intrinsic sensory neurons in the ENS detect and respond to sensory stimuli and how these mechanisms differ from extrinsic sensory nerve endings in the gut that underlie the gut–brain axis."
"The heterogeneity and continuous genetic adaptation of tumours complicate their detection and treatment via the targeting of genetic mutations. However, hallmarks of cancer such as aberrant protein phosphorylation and calcium-mediated cell signalling provide broadly conserved molecular targets. Here, we show that, for a range of solid tumours, a cyclic octapeptide labelled with a near-infrared dye selectively binds to phosphorylated Annexin A2 (pANXA2), with high affinity at high levels of calcium. Because of cancer-cell-induced pANXA2 expression in tumour-associated stromal cells, the octapeptide preferentially binds to the invasive edges of tumours and then traffics within macrophages to the tumour’s necrotic core. As proof-of-concept applications, we used the octapeptide to detect tumour xenografts and metastatic lesions, and to perform fluorescence-guided surgical tumour resection, in mice. Our findings suggest that high levels of pANXA2 in association with elevated calcium are present in the microenvironment of most solid cancers. The octapeptide might be broadly useful for selective tumour imaging and for delivering drugs to the edges and to the core of solid tumours."
"Guidelines advise precautionary measures for possible adverse events that may occur due to sedation during endoscopic procedures. To avoid complications, intraprocedural and postprocedural monitoring during recovery is considered important. However, since not many studies have reported on hypoxemia during the recovery period, findings for specific monitoring methods are insufficient. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of hypoxemia during the recovery period using continuous central-monitoring by pulse oximetry and to characterize the hypoxemia cases. Among the 4065 consecutive esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures under planned moderate sedation, 84 (2.1%) procedures developed unexpected hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 90%). Hypoxemia was observed during the procedure, at the end of the procedure, and during the recovery period in 21, 17, and 46 (1.1%) procedures, respectively. More than half of the hypoxemia cases occurred during the recovery period. Many hypoxemia cases were characterized by neither serious co-morbid illness nor low body mass index which have been reported as risk factors of hypoxemia. The lack of risk factors is no guarantee that hypoxemia will not occur. Therefore, continuous monitoring by pulse oximetry is more important during the recovery period and is recommended in all EGD procedures under planned moderate sedation."
"Previous studies identify a role for hypothalamic glia in energy balance regulation; however, a narrow hypothalamic focus provides an incomplete understanding of how glia throughout the brain respond to and regulate energy homeostasis. We examined the responses of glia in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) to the adipokine leptin and high fat diet-induced obesity. DVC astrocytes functionally express the leptin receptor; in vivo pharmacological studies suggest that DVC astrocytes partly mediate the anorectic effects of leptin in lean but not diet-induced obese rats. Ex vivo calcium imaging indicated that these changes were related to a lower proportion of leptin-responsive cells in the DVC of obese versus lean animals. Finally, we investigated DVC microglia and astroglia responses to leptin and energy balance dysregulation in vivo: obesity decreased DVC astrogliosis, whereas the absence of leptin signaling in Zucker rats was associated with extensive astrogliosis in the DVC and decreased hypothalamic micro- and astrogliosis. These data uncover a novel functional heterogeneity of astrocytes in different brain nuclei of relevance to leptin signaling and energy balance regulation."
"Angiotensin-(1–9) is a peptide from the noncanonical renin-angiotensin system with anti-hypertrophic effects in cardiomyocytes via an unknown mechanism. In the present study we aimed to elucidate it, basing us initially on previous work from our group and colleagues who proved a relationship between disturbances in mitochondrial morphology and calcium handling, associated with the setting of cardiac hypertrophy. Our first finding was that angiotensin-(1–9) can induce mitochondrial fusion through DRP1 phosphorylation. Secondly, angiotensin-(1–9) blocked mitochondrial fission and intracellular calcium dysregulation in a model of norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, preventing the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. To further investigate angiotensin-(1–9) anti-hypertrophic mechanism, we performed RNA-seq studies, identifying the upregulation of miR-129 under angiotensin-(1–9) treatment. miR-129 decreased the transcript levels of the protein kinase A inhibitor (PKIA), resulting in the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that PKA activity is necessary for the effects of angiotensin-(1–9) over mitochondrial dynamics, calcium handling and its anti-hypertrophic effects."
"ObjectiveTo characterize the prevalence of exchange transfusion (ET), clinical characteristics of infants receiving ET, and ET-associated morbidity and mortality.Study designWe conducted a multicenter cohort study of infants ≥23 weeks of gestational age (GA) with hyperbilirubinemia who underwent ET within 30 days of birth from 1997 to 2016. We examined clinical characteristics and adverse events after ET. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between clinical risk factors and death.ResultA total of 1252 infants were included; 4% died within 7 days of ET and 6% died before discharge. Compared with infants ≥37 weeks of GA, infants ≤29 weeks of GA had greater odds of death (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 20.08 [7.32, 55.07]).ConclusionsInfants ≤ 29 weeks of GA had greater odds of death following ET compared with term infants. These data will support clinicians in evaluating risks and prognosis for infants who require ET."
"Ultrasound (US) has been found to rejuvenate and invigorate the hair follicles, increase the size of hair shafts, and promote new hair growth. Our present study found that dual-frequency US-mediated microbubble (MB) cavitation significantly enhanced minoxidil (Mx) delivery in both in vitro and in vivo models, while increasing the hair growth efficacy compared to single-frequency US sonication. The in vitro experiments showed that cavitation activity was enhanced more significantly during dual-frequency sonication than single-frequency sonication in higher concentration of MBs. The pigskin penetration depth in the group in which dual-frequency US was combined with MBs was 1.54 and 2.86 times greater than for single-frequency US combined with MBs and in the control group, respectively; the corresponding increases in the release rate of Mx at 18 hours in in vitro Franz-diffusion-cell experiments were 24.9% and 43.7%. During 21 days of treatment in C57BL/6J mice experiments, the growth rate at day 11 in the group in which dual-frequency US was combined with MBs increased by 2.07 times compared to single-frequency US combined with MBs. These results indicate that dual-frequency US-mediated MB cavitation can significantly increase both skin permeability and transdermal drug delivery. At the same US power density, hair growth was greater in the group with dual-frequency US plus MBs than in the group with single-frequency US plus MBs, without damaging the skin in mice."
"Deforestation can increase the transmission of malaria. Here, we build upon the existing link between malaria risk and deforestation by investigating how the global demand for commodities that increase deforestation can also increase malaria risk. We use a database of trade relationships to link the consumption of deforestation-implicated commodities in developed countries to estimates of country-level malaria risk in developing countries. We estimate that about 20% of the malaria risk in deforestation hotspots is driven by the international trade of deforestation-implicated export commodities, such as timber, wood products, tobacco, cocoa, coffee and cotton. By linking malaria risk to final consumers of commodities, we contribute information to support demand-side policy measures to complement existing malaria control interventions, with co-benefits for reducing deforestation and forest disturbance."
"We have previously demonstrated functional and molecular changes in hippocampal subfields in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) psychosis associated with hippocampal excitability. In this study, we use RNA-seq and assess global transcriptome changes in the hippocampal subfields, DG, CA3, and CA1 from individuals with SZ psychosis and controls to elucidate subfield-relevant molecular changes. We also examine changes in gene expression due to antipsychotic medication in the hippocampal subfields from our SZ ON- and OFF-antipsychotic medication cohort. We identify unique subfield-specific molecular profiles in schizophrenia postmortem samples compared with controls, implicating astrocytes in DG, immune mechanisms in CA3, and synaptic scaling in CA1. We show a unique pattern of subfield-specific effects by antipsychotic medication on gene expression levels with scant overlap of genes differentially expressed by SZ disease effect versus medication effect. These hippocampal subfield changes serve to confirm and extend our previous model of SZ and can explain the lack of full efficacy of conventional antipsychotic medication on SZ symptomatology. With future characterization using single-cell studies, the identified distinct molecular profiles of the DG, CA3, and CA1 in SZ psychosis may serve to identify further potential hippocampal-based therapeutic targets."
"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have enriched the fields of genomics and drug development. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer with a bimodal age distribution and inadequate treatment options. Paediatric ACC is frequently associated with TP53 mutations, with particularly high incidence in Southern Brazil due to the TP53 p.R337H (R337H) germline mutation. The heterogeneous risk among carriers suggests other genetic modifiers could exist.MethodsWe analysed clinical, genotype and gene expression data derived from paediatric ACC, R337H carriers, and adult ACC patients. We restricted our analyses to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified in GWASs to associate with disease or human traits.ResultsA SNP, rs971074, in the alcohol dehydrogenase 7 gene significantly and reproducibly associated with allelic differences in ACC age-of-onset in both cohorts. Patients homozygous for the minor allele were diagnosed up to 16 years earlier. This SNP resides in a gene involved in the retinoic acid (RA) pathway and patients with differing levels of RA pathway gene expression in their tumours associate with differential ACC progression.ConclusionsThese results identify a novel genetic component to ACC development that resides in the retinoic acid pathway, thereby informing strategies to develop management, preventive and therapeutic treatments for ACC."
"Esophageal malignancy is a disease with poor prognosis. Curative therapy incorporates surgery and is burdensome with high rates of infection morbidity and mortality. The role of yeast as causative organisms of post-esophagectomy infections is poorly defined. Consequently, the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the University Medical Center Groningen among 565 post-esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017. The results show that 7.3% of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. For patients with yeast infections, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, more frequent intensive care unit readmissions, prolonged hospital stays and higher mortality rates were observed. One-year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection, as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast-positive pleural effusion. We conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable, and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Furthermore, yeast infections are associated with higher complication rates and mortality. These observations encourage further prospective investigations on the possible benefits of antifungal prophylactic therapy for esophagectomy patients."
"Infection and infection-related complications are important causes of death and morbidity following preterm birth. Despite this risk, there is limited understanding of the development of the immune system in those born prematurely, and of how this development is influenced by perinatal factors. Here we prospectively and longitudinally follow a cohort of babies born before 32 weeks of gestation. We demonstrate that preterm babies, including those born extremely prematurely (<28 weeks), are capable of rapidly acquiring some adult levels of immune functionality, in which immune maturation occurs independently of the developing heterogeneous microbiome. By contrast, we observe a reduced percentage of CXCL8-producing T cells, but comparable levels of TNF-producing T cells, from babies exposed to in utero or postnatal infection, which precedes an unstable post-natal clinical course. These data show that rapid immune development is possible in preterm babies, but distinct identifiable differences in functionality may predict subsequent infection mediated outcomes."
"The extensive literature has reported adverse effects on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on children’s health. We aim to analyze associations of ETS with dry night cough, croup, pneumonia, and frequent common cold and to disentangle the effects of prenatal, infancy and childhood exposure by multilevel logistic regression. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 41,176 children aged 3–8 years in 8 major cities of China during 2010–2011, and obtained demographic information, smoke exposure information, and respiratory outcomes. Parents’ smoking habit and indoor tobacco smoke odor were considered as two indicators of ETS. The prevalences of respiratory outcomes were 6.0% for croup, 9.5% for frequency common cold, 17.1% for dry night cough and 32.3% for pneumonia respectively in the study. The associations between respiratory outcomes and parental smoking were not obvious, while indoor tobacco smoke odor was clearly and strongly associated with most respiratory outcomes, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.06 to 1.95. Both infancy and childhood exposure to tobacco smoke odor were independent risk factors, but infancy exposure had a higher risk. The results explore that ETS increased the risk of respiratory outcomes in children, highlighting the need for raising awareness about the detrimental effects of tobacco smoke exposure."
"Regular aerobic physical exercise of moderate intensity is undeniably associated with improved health and increased longevity, with some studies suggesting that more is better. Endurance athletes exceed the usual recommendations for exercise by 15-fold to 20-fold. The need to sustain a large cardiac output for prolonged periods is associated with a 10–20% increase in left and right ventricular size and a substantial increase in left ventricular mass. A large proportion of endurance athletes have raised levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponins and B-type natriuretic peptide) and cardiac dysfunction for 24–48 h after events, but what is the relevance of these findings? In the longer term, some endurance athletes have an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis and arrhythmias. The inherent association between these ‘maladaptations’ and sudden cardiac death in the general population raises the question of whether endurance exercise could be detrimental for some individuals. However, despite speculation that these abnormalities confer an increased risk of future adverse events, elite endurance athletes have an increased life expectancy compared with the general population."
"The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is adjusted according to cytogenetic risk factors and molecular markers. Cytarabine remains the main drug to treat AML, and several studies have explored the prognostic relevance of the genotype of cytarabine metabolizing enzymes in AML. Glucuronidation has been identified to be relevant in the cytarabine clearance, but there are still few data concerning the clinical impact of genetic polymorphisms known to condition the activity of UDP-glucuronosyl transferases in AML patients. Here we report the association between the UGT1A1 rs8175347 genotype and the clinical outcome of 455 intermediate-risk cytogenetic AML patients receiving cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Patients with the UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (associated to a lower UGT1A1 activity) had a lower overall survival (OS) (25.8% vs. 45.5%; p: 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed this association (p: 0.008; HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.16–2.76). Subgroup analysis showed the negative effect of the UGT1A1*28 homozygous genotype on OS in women (14.8% vs. 52.7%; p: 0.001) but not in men. This lower OS was associated with longer neutropenia after consolidation chemotherapy and with higher mortality without previous relapse, suggesting an association between a low glucuronidation activity and mortal toxic events."
"Background/objectivesMaintaining energy balance is important to ensure a healthy organism. However, energy partitioning, coordinating the distribution of sufficient energy to different organs and tissues is equally important, but the control of this process is largely unknown. In obesity, an increase in fat mass necessitates the production of additional bone mass to cope with the increase in bodyweight and processes need to be in place to communicate this new weight bearing demand. Here, we investigate the interaction between leptin and NPY, two factors critically involved in the regulation of both energy metabolism and bone mass, in this process.MethodsWe assessed the co-localization of leptin receptors on NPY neurons using RNAScope followed by a systematic examination of body composition and energy metabolism profiling in male and female mice lacking leptin receptors specifically in NPY neurons (Leprlox/lox;NPYCre/+). The effect of short-term switching between chow and high-fat diet was also examined in these mice.ResultsWe uncovered that leptin receptor expression is greater on a subpopulation of NPY neurons in the arcuate that do not express AgRP. We further show that Leprlox/lox;NPYCre/+ mice exhibit significantly increased adiposity while bone mass is diminished. These body composition changes occur in the absence of alterations in food intake or energy expenditure, demonstrating a prominent role for leptin signaling in NPY neurons in the control of energy partitioning. Importantly however, when fed a high-fat diet, these mice display a switch in energy partitioning whereby they exhibit a significantly enhanced ability to increase their bone mass to match the increased bodyweight caused by higher caloric intake concurrent with attenuated adiposity.ConclusionsTaken together, these results demonstrate that leptin signaling in NPY neurons is critical for coordinating energy partitioning between fat and bone mass especially during situations of changes in energy balance."
"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is predominantly caused by heterozygous missense variants in the cardiac ryanodine receptor, RYR2. However, many RYR2 missense variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). We systematically re-evaluated all RYR2 variants in healthy individuals and those with CPVT or arrhythmia using the 2015 American College of Medical Genomics guidelines. RYR2 variants were identified by the NW Genomic Laboratory Hub, from the published literature and databases of sequence variants. Each variant was assessed based on minor allele frequencies, in silico prediction tools and appraisal of functional studies and classified according to the ACMG-AMP guidelines. Phenotype data was collated where available. Of the 326 identified RYR2 missense variants, 55 (16.9%), previously disease-associated variants were reclassified as benign. Application of the gnomAD database of >140,000 controls allowed reclassification of 11 variants more than the ExAC database. CPVT-associated RYR2 variants clustered predominantly between amino acid positions 3949–4332 and 4867–4967 as well as the RyR and IP3R homology-associated and ion transport domains (p < 0.005). CPVT-associated RYR2 variants occurred at more conserved amino acid positions compared with controls, and variants associated with sudden death had higher conservation scores (p < 0.005). There were five potentially pathogenic RYR2 variants associated with sudden death during sleep which were located almost exclusively in the C-terminus of the protein. In conclusion, control sequence databases facilitate reclassification of RYR2 variants but the majority remain as VUS. Notably, pathogenic variants in RYR2 are associated with death in sleep."
"BackgroundThe majority of patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) develop resistance to imatinib and sunitinib, the standard of care for these patients. This study evaluated the combination of buparlisib, an oral phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, with imatinib in patients with advanced GIST, who have failed prior therapy with imatinib and sunitinib.MethodsThis Phase 1b, multicentre, open-label study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended Phase 2 dose of buparlisib in combination with 400 mg of imatinib through a dose-escalation part and a dose-expansion part, and also evaluated the clinical profile of the combination.ResultsSixty patients were enrolled, including 25 in the dose-escalation part and 35 in the dose-expansion part. In the combination, MTD of buparlisib was established as 80 mg. No partial or complete responses were observed. The estimated median progression-free survival was 3.5 months in the expansion phase. Overall, 98.3% of patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs), including 45% with grade 3 or 4 AEs.ConclusionsBuparlisib in combination with imatinib provided no additional benefit compared with currently available therapies. Due to the lack of objective responses, further development of this combination was not pursued for third-line/fourth-line advanced/metastatic GIST.Trial registration numberNCT01468688."
"The cortico-striatal-pallidal-thalamic and limbic circuits are suggested to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Stimulation of deep brain targets might improve symptoms in treatment-resistant depression. However, a better understanding of connectivity properties of deep brain structures potentially implicated in deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment is needed. Using high-density EEG, we explored the directed functional connectivity at rest in 25 healthy subjects and 26 patients with moderate to severe depression within the bipolar affective disorder, depressive episode, and recurrent depressive disorder. We computed the Partial Directed Coherence on the source EEG signals focusing on the amygdala, anterior cingulate, putamen, pallidum, caudate, and thalamus. The global efficiency for the whole brain and the local efficiency, clustering coefficient, outflow, and strength for the selected structures were calculated. In the right amygdala, all the network metrics were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients than in controls. The global efficiency was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients than in controls, showed no correlation with status of depression, but decreased with increasing medication intake (\({{\bf{R}}}^{{\bf{2}}}{\boldsymbol{=}}{\bf{0.59}}\,{\bf{and}}\,{\bf{p}}{\boldsymbol{=}}{\bf{1.52}}{\bf{e}}{\boldsymbol{ \mbox{-} }}{\bf{05}}\)). The amygdala seems to play an important role in neurobiology of depression. Practical treatment studies would be necessary to assess the amygdala as a potential future DBS target for treating depression."
"We have previously reported that recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 3 (AAV3) vectors transduce human liver tumors more efficiently in a mouse xenograft model following systemic administration. Others have utilized AAV8 vectors expressing miR-26a and miR-122 to achieve near total inhibition of growth of mouse liver tumors. Since AAV3 vectors transduce human hepatic cells more efficiently than AAV8 vectors, in the present studies, we wished to evaluate the efficacy of AAV3-miR-26a/122 vectors in suppressing the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro, and human liver tumors in a mouse model in vivo. To this end, a human HCC cell line, Huh7, was transduced with various multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of AAV3-miR-26a or scAAV3-miR-122 vectors, or both, which also co-expressed a Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) reporter gene. Only a modest level of dose-dependent growth inhibition of Huh7 cells (~12–13%) was observed at the highest MOI (1 × 105 vgs/cell) with each vector. When Huh7 cells were co-transduced with both vectors, the extent of growth inhibition was additive (~26%). However, AAV3-miR-26a and scAAV3-miR-122 vectors led to ~70% inhibition of growth of Huh-derived human liver tumors in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. Thus, the combined use of miR-26a and scAAV3-miR-122 delivered by AAV3 vectors offers a potentially useful approach to target human liver tumors."
"Hydrocephalus is the most common neurosurgical disorder worldwide and is characterized by enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled brain ventricles resulting from failed CSF homeostasis. Since the 1840s, physicians have observed inflammation in the brain and the CSF spaces in both posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) and postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH). Reparative inflammation is an important protective response that eliminates foreign organisms, damaged cells and physical irritants; however, inappropriately triggered or sustained inflammation can respectively initiate or propagate disease. Recent data have begun to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation — driven by Toll-like receptor 4-regulated cytokines, immune cells and signalling pathways — contributes to the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. We propose that therapeutic approaches that target inflammatory mediators in both PHH and PIH could address the multiple drivers of disease, including choroid plexus CSF hypersecretion, ependymal denudation, and damage and scarring of intraventricular and parenchymal (glia–lymphatic) CSF pathways. Here, we review the evidence for a prominent role of inflammation in the pathogenic mechanism of PHH and PIH and highlight promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Focusing research efforts on inflammation could shift our view of hydrocephalus from that of a lifelong neurosurgical disorder to that of a preventable neuroinflammatory condition."
"ObjectiveTo determine whether ventilator-related fluctuations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) are associated with cerebral pressure passivity.Study designIn a prospective study of newborns undergoing positive-pressure ventilation, we calculated coherence between continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy hemoglobin difference (HbD). Significant HbD–MAP coherence indicated cerebral pressure passivity. CBV changes were measured as the spectral power of total hemoglobin (SHbT) at the ventilator frequency. A regression model tested whether SHbT predicts cerebral pressure passivity and/or death/brain injury, controlling for birth gestational age and other factors.ResultsWe studied 68 subjects with prematurity (n = 19), congenital heart disease (n = 11), and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (n = 38). SHbT, sedative use, and pCO2 were positively associated, and circulating hemoglobin negatively associated, with cerebral pressure passivity (p < 0.001), which was positively associated with brain injury (p < 0.001).ConclusionIn sick newborns, ventilator-related CBV fluctuations may predispose to cerebral pressure passivity, which may predispose to an adverse neonatal outcome."
"In this paper, an overview of advanced robotic surgical systems in ophthalmology is provided. The systems are introduced as representative examples of the degree of human vs. robotic control during surgical procedures. The details are presented on each system and the latest advancements of each are described. Future potential applications for surgical robotics in ophthalmology are discussed in detail, with representative examples provided alongside recent progress."
"The eye is said to be the window into the brain. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and glaucoma both being diseases of the elderly, have several epidemiological and histological overlaps in pathogenesis. Both these diseases are neurodegenerative conditions. Over the years, a consensus has developed that both may be two ends of a singular spectrum of diseases. Epidemiological studies have shown that more Alzheimer’s patients may be suffering from glaucoma than general healthy population. Retinal ganglion cell damage is a characteristic of both diseases, along with discovery of amyloid-β and tau protein deposition in the retina and aqueous humor of eye. The latter two proteins are known to be pathognomonic of AD. Other pathways such as the insulin receptor pathway also seem to be affected in both diseases similarly. In spite of these overlaps, there are few missing links which still need more evidence, namely, intraocular pressure mechanisms, cerebrospinal fluid pressure and trans-lamina cribrosa pressure gradients, vascular autoregulation factors, etc. Several factors point towards a common pathogenesis at some level for both diseases and prospective studies are necessary to study the natural course of both diseases."
"BackgroundThe arguments about whether intermittent or continuous tube feeding was preferred in patients with hemorrhagic stroke exist yet. This study aimed to examine the effects of intermittent versus continuous tube feeding on its intolerance performance and efficiency of calorie intake.MethodA convenience sample was selected from January 2018 to January 2019 in the Neurosurgery Department of West China Hospital, Sichuan Province. The participants were randomly allocated to either intermittent or continuous tube feeding group, fed four times or 24 h a day using electric feeding pump, respectively. The incidence of the intolerance and calorie intake were recorded and analyzed.Results78 patients took part in this study: 40 in the intermittent group and 38 in the continuous group. The incidence of the diarrhea was significantly lower in the continuous group (7.9 vs 37.5%, p = 0.002). The total intolerance rate was significantly lower in the continuous group compared with the intermittent group (63.2 vs 85.0%, p = 0.027). There was no significant difference in calorie intake between the intermittent and continuous group during the first 3 days (2595.4 ± 394.5 kcal vs 2317.8 ± 645.1 kcal, p = 0.099). No significant difference in total calorie intake was found between two groups (6265.6 ± 1261.3 kcal vs 6429.4 ± 1452.4 kcal, p = 0.597).ConclusionContinuous tube feeding was an effective way to improve the tolerance of enteral nutrition. But no enough evidence was found to support the advantage in calorie intake of continuous tube feeding in this study."
"There have been few advances in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) because of the lack of targets. MCL1, a member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family, may be a treatment target in several cancers, including SCLC. However, whether the expression profile of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family affects MCL1 inhibition strategy is unknown. A tissue microarray (TMA) was created from consecutive patients who were diagnosed with SCLC and had previously undergone surgery at Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto, Japan) between 2001 and 2017. We used S63845, a MCL1 inhibitor, to assess the cytotoxic capacity in SCLC cell lines including a patient-derived cell line in vitro and in vivo. The combination of S63845 with navitoclax, a double BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor, was also employed to examine the comprehensive inhibition of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Immunohistochemistry of a TMA from patients with surgically resected SCLC demonstrated high MCL1 expression with low BCL-XL and BCL-2 to be the most common expression profile. S63845 was effective in high MCL1- and low BCL-XL-expressing SCLC cell lines. S63845 induced BAK-dependent apoptosis in vitro, and the anti-tumor efficacy was confirmed in an in vivo model. Although knockdown of BCL-XL and BCL-2 improved the cytotoxic activity of S63845 and its combination with navitoclax increased the anti-tumor cytotoxicity, the therapeutic range of S63845 with navitoclax was narrow in in vivo studies. Our study suggests MCL1 inhibition therapy be applied for high MCL1- and low BCL-XL-expressing SCLC patients."
"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT-SIB) reduces overall treatment duration and results in less radiotherapy (RT)-induced dermatitis. However, the use of traditional sequential approach or IMRT-SIB is still under debate since there is not enough evidence of long-term clinical outcomes. The present study investigated 216 patients who underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS) between 2010 and 2013. The median age was 51 years (range, 21–81 years). All patients received IMRT-SIB, 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction to the whole breast and 60.2 Gy at 2.15 Gy per fraction to the tumor bed by integral boost. Among 216 patients, 175 patients received post-operative RT with forward IMRT and 41 patients had Tomotherapy. The median follow-up was 6.4 years. Forty patients (97.6%) in the Tomotherapy arm and 147 patients (84%) in the IMRT arm developed grade 0–1 skin toxicity (P = 0.021). For the entire cohort, the 5-year and 7-year overall survival (OS) rates were 94.4% and 93.1% respectively. The 7-year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 100% vs 89.1% in the Tomotherapy and IMRT arm respectively (P = 0.028). In conclusion, Tomotherapy improved acute skin toxicity compared with forward IMRT-SIB. Chronic skin complication was 1.9%. IMRT-SIB resulted in good long-term survival."
"Inflammasomes are multi-component signaling complexes critical to the initiation of pyroptotic cell death in response to invading pathogens and cellular damage. A number of innate immune receptors have been reported to serve as inflammasome sensors. Activation of these sensors leads to the proteolytic activation of caspase-1, a proinflammatory caspase responsible for the cleavage of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 and the effector of pyroptotic cell death, gasdermin D. Though crucial to the innate immune response to infection, dysregulation of inflammasome activation can lead to the development of inflammatory diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Therefore, clinical interest in the modulation of inflammasome activation is swiftly growing. As such, it is imperative to develop a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these complexes. In this review, we divide the regulation of inflammasome activation into three parts. We discuss the transcriptional regulation of inflammasome components and related proteins, the post-translational mechanisms of inflammasome activation, and advances in the understanding of the structural basis of inflammasome activation."
"Emerging drug resistance and high-attrition rates in early and late stage drug development necessitate accelerated development of antimalarial compounds. However, systematic and meaningful translation of drug efficacy and host-parasite dynamics between preclinical testing stages is missing. We developed an ensemble of mathematical within-host parasite growth and antimalarial action models, fitted to extensive data from four antimalarials with different modes of action, to assess host-parasite interactions in two preclinical drug testing systems of murine parasite P. berghei in mice, and human parasite P. falciparum in immune-deficient mice. We find properties of the host-parasite system, namely resource availability, parasite maturation and virulence, drive P. berghei dynamics and drug efficacy, whereas experimental constraints primarily influence P. falciparum infection and drug efficacy. Furthermore, uninvestigated parasite behavior such as dormancy influences parasite recrudescence following non-curative treatment and requires further investigation. Taken together, host-parasite interactions should be considered for meaningful translation of pharmacodynamic properties between murine systems and for predicting human efficacious treatment."
"The function of the fibrinolytic system was first identified to dissolve fibrin to maintain vascular patency. Connections between the fibrinolytic system and many other physiological and pathological processes have been well established. Dysregulation of the fibrinolytic system is closely associated with multiple pathological conditions, including thrombosis, inflammation, cancer progression, and neuropathies. Thus, molecules in the fibrinolytic system are potent therapeutic and diagnostic targets. This review summarizes the currently used agents targeting this system and the development of novel therapeutic strategies in experimental studies. Future directions for the development of modulators of the fibrinolytic system are also discussed."
"BackgroundThe prevalence of overweight and obesity in Mexican schoolchildren has increased in the past three decades. Dietary pattern approaches to assess diet have been used to study the relation between nutrition and chronic conditions.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to analyze the association between dietary patterns (DP) and overweight and obesity in Mexican schoolchildren.MethodsWe analyzed information from schoolchildren who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (ENSANUT-2012). Dietary information was obtained through a 24-h recall of 2751 children (5–11 year). Foods were classified into 33 groups, and the DPs were identified by cluster analysis (k-means method). Weight and height were measured to estimate the body mass index (BMI), by classifying overweight if the Z score was >1 and ≤2 standard deviations (SD), and obesity when the Z score was >2SD. To analyze the association, a Poisson regression model was used, adjusting by age, region, area of residence, socioeconomic status (SES), and the survey design.ResultsFour DPs were identified: “Traditional”, “Industrialized”, “Varied”, and “Modern”. The “Modern” DP was associated with obesity (PR = 1.7) (p < 0.05) compared with the “Traditional” DP.ConclusionsThe “Modern” DP could be influencing the development of obesity in Mexican schoolchildren. The promotion of healthy food and public health strategies to those food groups that should be discouraged are necessary to reverse the obesity epidemic in Mexican children."
"The objective was to describe funding sources and publication trends for the primary literature on Peyronie’s disease (PD), including direct industry research support. A search of EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed to identify articles published from 2006 to 2018. Articles not published in English, reviews, case reports, editorials, guidelines, and meta-analysis were excluded from analysis. Data collected included year and journal of publication, major focus, and funding sources. The US Federal Open Payments database was searched for direct industry research payments to authors. Four hundred thirty-seven articles met criteria. The median number of yearly publications was 31. The most frequent publications were Journal of Sexual Medicine (25.6%), Urology (8.9%), BJU International (7.3%), and Journal of Urology (5.7%). Plaque excision/grafting was the most common topic (16.5%) followed by pathophysiology (15.3%), and intralesional therapy (14.9%). Only 15.1% (n = 66) of articles had a funding source with only 2.3% (n = 10) articles receiving any National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. In total, 4.1% (n = 18) of the articles were industry funded, 61.1% (n = 11) of these from Xiaflex manufacturer Endo/Auxilium. Remaining articles appeared self-funded. There were 1524 unique authors and just 13 received any direct industry funds, totaling US$718,426. Most PD research is self-funded with only a small percentage from NIH or industry."
"The remineralization mechanism in dental caries lesions is not completely understood. This study reports on ultrastructural and chemical changes observed within arrested caries lesions. Carious human teeth were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused-ion-beam (FIB)-SEM. The crystals detected in the caries lesions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), along with chemical element mapping using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)-STEM. FIB-SEM 3D reconstructions revealed a severely damaged dentin surface abundantly covered by bacteria. Although the dentin tubules were clogged up to a depth of 100 μm, bacterial invasion into dentin tubules was not observed. TEM crystal analysis and EDS-STEM revealed the presence of Ca and P, as well as of Mg within the HAp crystals deposited inside the dentin tubules. It was concluded that extensive remineralization with deposition of Mg-HAp crystals had occurred in dentin tubules of caries-arrested dentin. Understanding the natural remineralization process is thought to be helpful for developing clinical biomimetic remineralization protocols."
"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. High-throughput DNA methylation assays have been used broadly in cancer research. Histopathology images are commonly obtained in cancer treatment, given that tissue sampling remains the clinical gold-standard for diagnosis. In this work, we investigate the interaction between cancer histopathology images and DNA methylation profiles to provide a better understanding of tumor pathobiology at the epigenetic level. We demonstrate that classical machine learning algorithms can associate the DNA methylation profiles of cancer samples with morphometric features extracted from whole slide images. Furthermore, grouping the genes into methylation clusters greatly improves the performance of the models. The well-predicted genes are enriched in key pathways in carcinogenesis including hypoxia in glioma and angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma. Our results provide new insights into the link between histopathological and molecular data."
"In a clinical trial of cerebral palsy, the level of plasma interleukin-8 (IL-8) was increased, correlated with motor improvement, after human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (hUCBC) infusion. This study aimed to elucidate the role of IL-8 in the therapeutic effects of hUCBCs in a mouse model of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (HI). In P7 HI mouse brains, hUCBC administration at day 7 after HI upregulated the gene expression of Cxcl2, the mouse IL-8 homologue and increased the expression of its receptor, CXCR2. hUCBC administration restored the sequential downstream signalling axis of p-p38/p-MAPKAPK2, NFκB, and angiogenic factors, which were downregulated by HI. An in vitro assay revealed the downregulation of the angiogenic pathway by CXCR2 knockdown and p38 inhibition. In vivo p38 inhibition prior to hUCBC administration in HI mouse brains produced identical results. Behavioural outcomes revealed a therapeutic effect (ps < 0.01) of hUCBC or IL-8 administration, which was correlated with decreases in infarct size and angiogenic findings in the striatum. In conclusion, the response of the host to hUCBC administration in mice upregulated Cxcl2, which led to the activation of the IL-8-mediated p-p38 signalling pathway. The upregulation of the downstream pathway and angiogenic growth factors via NFκB can be inferred to be the potential therapeutic mechanism of hUCBCs."
"Derived from our original nomogram study by using the risk variables from multivariable analyses in the derivation cohort of 1383 patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type (ENKTCL) who were mostly treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, we propose an easily used nomogram-revised risk index (NRI), validated it and compared with Ann Arbor staging, the International Prognostic Index (IPI), Korean Prognostic Index (KPI), and prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma (PINK) for overall survival (OS) prediction by examining calibration, discrimination, and decision curve analysis in a validation cohort of 1582 patients primarily treated with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The calibration of the NRI showed satisfactory for predicting 3- and 5-year OS in the validation cohort. The Harrell’s C-index and integrated Brier score (IBS) of the NRI for OS prediction demonstrated a better performance than that of the Ann Arbor staging system, IPI, KPI, and PINK. Decision curve analysis of the NRI also showed a superior outcome. The NRI is a promising tool for stratifying patients with ENKTCL into risk groups for designing clinical trials and for selecting appropriate individualized treatment."
"Because intractable itch reduces quality of life, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of itch is required to develop antipruritic treatments. Itch is mediated by peripheral sensory neurons, which originate from the neural crest (NC) during development. Itch-associated signaling molecules have been detected in genetically engineered animals and in cultures of peripheral neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Ethical difficulties collecting peripheral neurons from human DRG have limited analysis of itch in humans. This study describes a method of differentiating peripheral neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for physiological study of itch. This method resulted in the robust induction of p75 and HNK1 double-positive NC cells from hiPSCs. The expression of NC markers TFAP2A, SOX10 and SNAI1 increased during NC induction. The induction efficiency was nearly 90%, and human peripheral neurons expressing peripherin were efficiently differentiated from hiPSC-derived NC cells. Moreover, induced peripheral neurons expressed the sensory neuronal marker BRN3A and the itch-related receptors HRH1, MRGPRX1, IL31R and IL-4R. Calcium imaging analyses indicated that these peripheral neurons included sensory neurons responsive to itch-related stimuli such as histamine, BAM8-22, IL-31 and IL-4. These findings may enable detailed analyses of human DRG neurons and may result in new therapies for intractable itch."
"The reason for the reduced efficacy of lung cancer therapy is the existence of lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CSCs results in evolved phenotypes with increased malignancy, leading to therapy failure. Here, we propose a new therapeutic strategy: investigating the “transitional” cells that represent the stage between normal lung stem cells and lung CSCs. Identifying and targeting the key molecule that drives carcinogenesis to inhibit or reverse this process would thus provide new perspectives for early diagnosis and intervention in lung cancer. We used Gprc5a-knockout (KO) mice, the first animal model of spontaneous lung adenocarcinoma established by the deletion of a single lung tumor suppressor gene. We investigated the interaction of lung progenitor cells AT2 with Lgr5 cells in the generation of CSCs and related signaling mechanism. In the present study, using Gprc5a-KO mice, we found the initiator Sca-1+Abcg1+ subset with a CSC-like phenotype within the lung progenitor AT2 cell population in mice that had not yet developed tumors. We confirmed the self-renewal and tumor initiation capacities of this subset in vitro, in vivo, and clinical samples. Mechanistically, we found that the generation of Sca-1+Abcg1+ cells was associated with an interaction between AT2 and Lgr5 cells and the subsequent activation of the ECM1-α6β4-ABCG1 axis. Importantly, Sca-1+Abcg1+ and SPA+ABCG1+ cells specifically existed in the small bronchioles of Gprc5a-KO mice and patients with pneumonia, respectively. Thus, the present study unveiled a new kind of lung cancer-initiating cells (LCICs) and provided potential markers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer."
"Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most frequent cancer type in young men and originate from the common precursor germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). For decades, clinical management of patients with TGCT has relied on classic serum tumour markers: α-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin subunit-β and lactate dehydrogenase. In the past 10 years, microRNAs have been shown to outperform classic serum tumour markers in the diagnosis of primary tumours and in follow-up monitoring and prediction of relapse. miR-371a-3p is the most consistent marker and exhibits >90% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in TGCT. However, miR-371a-3p cannot be used to diagnose GCNIS or mature teratoma. Future efforts must technically standardize the microRNA-based methods internationally and introduce miR-371a-3p as a molecular liquid biopsy-based marker for TGCTs in the clinic."
"BackgroundMutations in KRAS result in a constitutively activated MAPK pathway. In KRAS-mutant tumours existing treatment options, e.g. MEK inhibition, have limited efficacy due to resistance through feedback activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (HER).MethodsIn this Phase 1 study, the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib was combined with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD-0325901 in patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received escalating oral doses of once daily dacomitinib and twice daily PD-0325901 to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02039336).ResultsEight out of 41 evaluable patients (27 colorectal cancer, 11 NSCLC and 3 pancreatic cancer) among 8 dose levels experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The RP2D with continuous dacomitinib dosing was 15 mg of dacomitinib plus 6 mg of PD-0325901 (21 days on/7 days off), but major toxicity, including rash (85%), diarrhoea (88%) and nausea (63%), precluded long-term treatment. Therefore, other intermittent schedules were explored, which only slightly improved toxicity. Tumour regression was seen in eight patients with the longest treatment duration (median 102 days) in NSCLC.ConclusionsAlthough preliminary signs of antitumour activity in NSCLC were seen, we do not recommend further exploration of this combination in KRAS-mutant patients due to its negative safety profile."
"Molecular mechanisms mediating tonic secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to hypocalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism (HPT) are unclear. Here we demonstrate increased heterocomplex formation between the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B1 receptor (GABAB1R) in hyperplastic parathyroid glands (PTGs) of patients with primary and secondary HPT. Targeted ablation of GABAB1R or glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 and 2 in PTGs produces hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, and prevents PTH hypersecretion in PTGs cultured from mouse models of hereditary HPT and dietary calcium-deficiency. Cobinding of the CaSR/GABAB1R complex by baclofen and high extracellular calcium blocks the coupling of heterotrimeric G-proteins to homomeric CaSRs in cultured cells and promotes PTH secretion in cultured mouse PTGs. These results combined with the ability of PTG to synthesize GABA support a critical autocrine action of GABA/GABAB1R in mediating tonic PTH secretion of PTGs and ascribe aberrant activities of CaSR/GABAB1R heteromer to HPT."
"Identification of genomic and epigenomic determinants of drug resistance provides important insights for improving cancer treatment. Using agnostic genome-wide interrogation of messenger RNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression, DNA methylation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number alterations and single-nucleotide variants/indels in primary human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, we identified 463 genomic features associated with glucocorticoid resistance. Gene-level aggregation identified 118 overlapping genes, 15 of which were confirmed by genome-wide CRISPR screen. Collectively, this identified 30 of 38 (79%) known glucocorticoid-resistance genes/miRNAs and all 38 known resistance pathways, while revealing 14 genes not previously associated with glucocorticoid resistance. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and network-based transcriptomic modeling corroborated the top previously undiscovered gene, CELSR2. Manipulation of CELSR2 recapitulated glucocorticoid resistance in human leukemia cell lines and revealed a synergistic drug combination (prednisolone and venetoclax) that mitigated resistance in mouse xenograft models. These findings illustrate the power of an integrative genomic strategy for elucidating genes and pathways conferring drug resistance in cancer cells."
"Despite the utilization of various biochemical markers and probability calculation algorithms based on clinical studies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), more specific and practical biochemical markers remain to be found for improved diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we aimed to detect the alteration of metabolite profiles, explore the correlation between serum metabolites and inflammatory markers, and seek potential biomarkers for young adults with CAP. 13 Eligible young mild CAP patients between the ages of 18 and 30 years old with CURB65 = 0 admitted to the respiratory medical department were enrolled, along with 36 healthy participants as control. Untargeted metabolomics profiling was performed and metabolites including alcohols, amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, etc. were detected. A total of 227 serum metabolites were detected. L-Alanine, 2-Hydroxybutyric acid, Methylcysteine, L-Phenylalanine, Aminoadipic acid, L-Tryptophan, Rhamnose, Palmitoleic acid, Decanoylcarnitine, 2-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid and Oxoglutaric acid were found to be significantly altered, which were enriched mainly in propanoate and tryptophan metabolism, as well as antibiotic-associated pathways. Aminoadipic acid was found to be significantly correlated with CRP levels and 2-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid and Palmitoleic acid with PCT levels. The top 3 metabolites of diagnostic values are 2-Hydroxybutyric acid(AUC = 0.90), Methylcysteine(AUC = 0.85), and L-Alanine(AUC = 0.84). The AUC for CRP and PCT are 0.93 and 0.91 respectively. Altered metabolites were correlated with inflammation severity and were of great diagnostic value for CAP."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer in U.S. men and many other countries. Although primary PCa can be controlled with surgery or radiation, treatment options of preventing metastatic PCa are still limited. To develop a new treatment of eradicating metastatic PCa, we have created an injectable cancer trap that can actively recruit cancer cells in bloodstream. The cancer trap is composed of hyaluronic acid microparticles that have good cell and tissue compatibility and can extend the release of chemokines to 4 days in vitro. We find that erythropoietin (EPO) and stromal derived factor-1α can attract PCa in vitro. Animal results show that EPO-releasing cancer trap attracted large number of circulating PCa and significantly reduced cancer spreading to other organs compared with controls. These results support that cancer trap may serve as a unique device to sequester circulating PCa cells and subsequently reduce distant metastasis."
"Solute carriers (SLCs) are the largest family of transmembrane transporters in humans and are major determinants of cellular metabolism. Several SLCs have been shown to be required for the uptake of chemical compounds into cellular systems, but systematic surveys of transporter–drug relationships in human cells are currently lacking. We performed a series of genetic screens in a haploid human cell line against 60 cytotoxic compounds representative of the chemical space populated by approved drugs. By using an SLC-focused CRISPR–Cas9 library, we identified transporters whose absence induced resistance to the drugs tested. This included dependencies involving the transporters SLC11A2/SLC16A1 for artemisinin derivatives and SLC35A2/SLC38A5 for cisplatin. The functional dependence on SLCs observed for a significant proportion of the screened compounds suggests a widespread role for SLCs in the uptake and cellular activity of cytotoxic drugs and provides an experimentally validated set of SLC–drug associations for a number of clinically relevant compounds.

"There is a growing burden of cardiometabolic disease in many parts of the world. Despite some progress in its prevention, more can be done to tackle risks of its development in the community and in different specialty clinics. Currently, the identification and management of those at elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes or with conditions such as fatty liver disease remains fragmented and is not linked to constructive lifestyle advice. In this Perspective, we argue for a more consistent weight-management approach, alongside a holistic assessment of the risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases, offering patients a range of simple or more-intensive evidence-based lifestyle options in an empathetic manner, with encouragement for repeated attempts and a willingness to embrace failure."
"ObjectiveThis study explored the availability and perception of Global Health (GH) training opportunities in US-based Neonatal–Perinatal Medicine (NPM) fellowship programs.Study designElectronic surveys, containing discrete choice and open-ended questions, were distributed to current and recent fellows and to Program Directors (PDs).ResultsFifty-eight PDs and ninety-eight fellows completed the survey. Fellows reported declining GH participation from 48% in medical school to 21% in fellowship. Among the 42% of fellows reporting GH opportunities at their programs, 30% personally participated. Fewer than 30% of these programs offer structured classroom or online learning; 10% offer research opportunities. 72% of fellows stated that GH availability is moderately to extremely important, compared with 58% of PDs. PDs cited cost, scheduling, mentorship, and lack of suitable global partners as barriers to supporting fellows in GH.ConclusionNPM fellows place high importance on GH opportunities during fellowship, but only a minority engage in GH work."
"The idea that predictions shape how we perceive and comprehend the world has become increasingly influential in the field of systems neuroscience. It also forms an important framework for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders, which are proposed to be the result of disturbances in the mechanisms through which prior information influences perception and belief, leading to the production of suboptimal models of the world. There is a widespread tendency to conceptualize the influence of predictions exclusively in terms of ‘top-down’ processes, whereby predictions generated in higher-level areas exert their influence on lower-level areas within an information processing hierarchy. However, this excludes from consideration the predictive information embedded in the ‘bottom-up’ stream of information processing. We describe evidence for the importance of this distinction and argue that it is critical for the development of the predictive processing framework and, ultimately, for an understanding of the perturbations that drive the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and experiences."
"High glucose uptake by cancer compared to normal tissues has long been utilized in fluorodeoxyglucose-based positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a contrast mechanism. The FDG uptake rate has been further related to the proliferative potential of cancer, specifically the proliferation index (PI) − the proportion of cells in S, G2 or M phases. The underlying hypothesis was that the cells preparing for cell division would consume more energy and metabolites as building blocks for biosynthesis. Despite the wide clinical use, mixed reports exist in the literature on the relationship between FDG uptake and PI. This may be due to the large variation in cancer types or methods adopted for the measurements. Of note, the existing methods can only measure the average properties of a tumor mass or cell population with highly-heterogeneous constituents. In this study, we have built a multi-modal live-cell radiography system and measured the [18F]FDG uptake by single HeLa cells together with their dry mass and cell cycle phase. The results show that HeLa cells take up twice more [18F]FDG in S, G2 or M phases than in G1 phase, which confirms the association between FDG uptake and PI at a single-cell level. Importantly, we show that [18F]FDG uptake and cell dry mass have a positive correlation in HeLa cells, which suggests that high [18F]FDG uptake in S, G2 or M phases can be largely attributed to increased dry mass, rather than the activities preparing for cell division. This interpretation is consistent with recent observations that the energy required for the preparation of cell division is much smaller than that for maintaining house-keeping proteins."
"This study explores the degree to which genetic influences on psychotic experiences are stable across adolescence and adulthood, and their overlap with psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association results were obtained for adolescent psychotic experiences and negative symptom traits (N = 6297–10,098), schizotypy (N = 3967–4057) and positive psychotic experiences in adulthood (N = 116,787–117,794), schizophrenia (N = 150,064), bipolar disorder (N = 41,653), and depression (N = 173,005). Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations. Implicated genes from functional and gene-based analyses were compared. Mendelian randomization was performed on trait pairs with significant genetic correlations. Results indicated that subclinical auditory and visual hallucinations and delusions of persecution during adulthood were significantly genetically correlated with schizophrenia (rg = 0.27–0.67) and major depression (rg = 0.41–96) after correction for multiple testing. Auditory and visual subclinical hallucinations were highly genetically correlated (rg = 0.95). Cross-age genetic correlations for psychotic experiences were not significant. Gene mapping and association analyses revealed 14 possible genes associated with psychotic experiences that overlapped across age for psychotic experiences or between psychotic experiences and psychiatric disorders. Mendelian randomization indicated bidirectional associations between auditory and visual hallucinations in adults but did not support causal relationships between psychotic experiences and psychiatric disorders. These findings indicate that psychotic experiences in adulthood may be more linked genetically to schizophrenia and major depression than psychotic experiences in adolescence. Our study implicated specific genes that are associated with psychotic experiences across development, as well as genes shared between psychotic experiences and psychiatric disorders."
"This paper presents information on the gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations of two hundred twenty-six groundwater samples collected by gas flow proportional counters in southern Vietnam. The gross alpha results in the water samples ranged from 0.024 to 0.748 Bq L−1 with a mean of 0.183 ± 0.034 Bq L−1, and the gross beta results in the water samples ranged from 0.027–0.632 Bq L−1 with a mean of 0.152 ± 0.015 Bq L−1. The values obtained in this work were compared with those previously published for various regions or countries. Next, untreated and treated groundwater samples were analyzed to assess their influences on the treatment process. The results showed that there were differences in the minimum detection concentrations and the mean activity values between the untreated and treated groundwater samples (The p-value of the mean comparison tests is significant with p < 0.05). In both sample groups, there was a strong positive correlation of the gross alpha versus the gross beta results (r > 0.6). This means that among the radionuclides, the major sources of beta radiation are uranium and thorium decay series radionuclides. Finally, the annual effective dose for adults (>17 years) was calculated based on the assumption that major radionuclides have the highest effective dose conversion factors. In general, the results for Pb-210, Ra-226, and Ra-228 were observed to be lower than the recommended reference values established by the World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency, except for the value of Po-210."
"ObjectiveTo assess the correlation between infant mortality and extreme prematurity by state.Study designThis ecological study included data on 28,526,534 infants from 2007 to 2013 in all 50 US states and DC using CDC WONDER linked birth and infant death records. Regression analyses determined the correlation between infant and neonatal mortality rates and the proportion of extremely preterm, extremely low birth weight, and black births by state.ResultsState infant and neonatal mortality rates were directly and highly correlated with the proportion of extremely preterm births (infant, r2 = 0.71, P < 0.001; neonatal, r2 = 0.77, P < 0.001) and extremely low birth weight births (r2 = 0.63, P < 0.001; r2 = 0.73, P < 0.001). The proportion of black births also correlated directly with infant and neonatal mortality rates.ConclusionsInterstate variation in infant and neonatal mortality rates are primarily driven by rates of extremely preterm and extremely low birth weight births which is closely related to the proportion of black births."
"The initial evaluation of a suspected sepsis in a neonate is always challenging. There are many methods to screen a neonate with suspected sepsis. One of newer method is to assess the changes in neutrophil volume conductivity and scatter. The objective of this study was to establish changes in Neutrophil volume conductivity scatter (VCS) in neonatal sepsis and to determine appropriate cut off levels using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Neonates with suspected sepsis were evaluated with blood counts, culture and neutrophil VCS parameters. Based on these parameters neonates were classified into sepsis group (Blood culture positive), Probable sepsis group (clinical course consistent with sepsis and positive sepsis screen and negative blood culture), No sepsis group (Clinical course not suggestive of sepsis with negative sepsis screen and blood culture). A total of 304 neonates were included in the study of which 144 were in sepsis group and 160 in no sepsis group respectively. Among the neutrophil VCS parameters there was significant difference between the groups with respect to mean neutrophil volume (MNV) and volume distribution width (VDW) (180 vs 163 vs 150) (p < 0.01). MNV and VDW had good sensitivity (95%, 82%) and specificity (86%, 74%) for diagnosis of sepsis. In conclusion, Neutrophil VCS parameters, especially MNV, can be incorporated with other sepsis screen parameters in diagnosis of neonatal sepsis."
"With the development of data mining, machine learning offers opportunities to improve discrimination by analyzing complex interactions among massive variables. To test the ability of machine learning algorithms for predicting risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural Chinese population, we focus on a total of 36,652 eligible participants from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Risk assessment models for T2DM were developed using six machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The model performance was measured in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under precision recall curve. The importance of variables was identified based on each classifier and the shapley additive explanations approach. Using all available variables, all models for predicting risk of T2DM demonstrated strong predictive performance, with AUCs ranging between 0.811 and 0.872 using laboratory data and from 0.767 to 0.817 without laboratory data. Among them, the GBM model performed best (AUC: 0.872 with laboratory data and 0.817 without laboratory data). Performance of models plateaued when introduced 30 variables to each model except CART model. Among the top-10 variables across all methods were sweet flavor, urine glucose, age, heart rate, creatinine, waist circumference, uric acid, pulse pressure, insulin, and hypertension. New important risk factors (urinary indicators, sweet flavor) were not found in previous risk prediction methods, but determined by machine learning in our study. Through the results, machine learning methods showed competence in predicting risk of T2DM, leading to greater insights on disease risk factors with no priori assumption of causality."
"Peyronie’s disease (PD)-related penile deformity is managed with multiple treatment modalities including oral medications, intralesional injections, and surgery. Penile traction therapy (PTT) is one such modality with purported benefits, albeit with notable differences in the characteristics of available traction devices and published study protocols. We provide a comprehensive review of the available data supporting PTT for PD treatment. We performed a rigorous database search to identify all studies pertaining to PTT for the treatment of PD through November 2019. Seventeen trials explored use of PTT as monotherapy or in combination with surgical or nonsurgical treatment, using over five different commercially available devices. All devices were well tolerated, although compliance and daily duration of use were highly variable. PTT resulted in variable improvements in stretched penile length and penile curvature, depending on study protocol, patient population, and device. PTT appears to be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for PD as monotherapy or in combination with other nonsurgical and surgical treatments, and for men in both the acute and chronic phases. Further studies are needed to compare available devices, evaluate device characteristics associated with treatment success, differentiate outcomes in acute vs. chronic PD populations, and determine the optimal duration of use."
"Longitudinal studies measuring changes in cortical morphology over time are best facilitated by parcellation schemes compatible across all life stages. The Melbourne Children’s Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases provide voxel-based parcellations of the cerebral cortex compatible with the Desikan-Killiany (DK) and the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labelling schemes. This study introduces surface-based versions of the M-CRIB and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases, termed M-CRIB-S(DK) and M-CRIB-S(DKT), with a pipeline for automated parcellation utilizing FreeSurfer and developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) tools. Using T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of healthy neonates (n = 58), we created average spherical templates of cortical curvature and sulcal depth. Manually labelled regions in a subset (n = 10) were encoded into the spherical template space to construct M-CRIB-S(DK) and M-CRIB-S(DKT) atlases. Labelling accuracy was assessed using Dice overlap and boundary discrepancy measures with leave-one-out cross-validation. Cross-validated labelling accuracy was high for both atlases (average regional Dice = 0.79–0.83). Worst-case boundary discrepancy instances ranged from 9.96–10.22 mm, which appeared to be driven by variability in anatomy for some cases. The M-CRIB-S atlas data and automatic pipeline allow extraction of neonatal cortical surfaces labelled according to the DK or DKT parcellation schemes."
"Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is a mainstay of the treatment for brain metastases (BM). We evaluated prognostic factors in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing WBRT for BM. The medical records of 106 CRC patients undergoing WBRT for BM between 2000 and 2014 at three institutions were reviewed. Patient and tumor factors were analyzed to identify the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) calculated from the date of BM diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up. Surgical resection of BM was performed in six patients. The dose of WBRT was 30 Gy, and boost radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery (8–23 Gy) was given to 15 patients. Systemic therapy for BM was administered in one patient before WBRT and 26 patients after WBRT. The median follow-up time was 3.9 months (range, 0.4–114.1 months). The median OS time was 3.9 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 18.2%. Older age (>65 years), multiple BM (≥3), elevated level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, >5 ng/ml) at BM diagnosis, and extracranial metastases were adverse prognostic factors for OS. Patient with 0–1 factor showed better OS (at 1 year, 76.9%) than patients with 2 factors (16.7%) or 3–4 factors (4.2%; p < 0.001). In conclusion, we evaluated age, the number of BM, CEA level, and extracranial metastases as the prognostic factors for OS in CRC patients undergoing WBRT. Our result might be useful to develop prognostic models predicting survival for patients whom WBRT is intended for."
"IntroductionSpinal cord injury (SCI) in infancy magnifies the complexity of a devastating diagnosis. Children injured so young have high incidences of scoliosis, hip dysplasia, and respiratory complications leading to poor health and outcomes. We report the medical history, progression of rehabilitation, usual care and activity-based therapy, and outcomes for a child injured in infancy. Activity-based therapy (ABT) aims to activate the neuromuscular system above and below the lesion through daily, task-specific training to improve the neuromuscular capacity, and outcomes for children with acquired SCI.Case presentationA 3-month-old infant suffered a cervical SCI from a surgical complication with resultant tetraplegia. Until age 3, her medical complications included scoliosis, kyphosis, and pneumonia. Even with extensive physical and occupational therapy, she was fully dependent on caregivers for mobility and unable to roll, come to sit, sit, stand or walk. She initiated ABT at ~3 years old, participating for 8 months. The child’s overall neuromuscular capacity improved significantly, especially for head and trunk control, contributing to major advances in respiratory health, novel engagement with her environment, and improved physical abilities.DiscussionFrom injury during infancy until 3 years old, this child’s health, abilities, and complications were consistent with the predicted path of early-onset SCI. Due to her age at injury, severity and chronicity of injury, she demonstrated unexpected, meaningful changes in her neuromuscular capacity during and post-ABT associated with improved health, function and quality of life for herself and her caregivers."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease for which the pathophysiological mechanisms of motor neuron loss are not precisely clarified. Environmental and epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRNAs) could have a role in disease progression. We studied the expression pattern of miRNAs in ALS serum from 60 patients and 29 healthy controls. We also analyzed how deregulated miRNAs found in serum affected cellular pathways such as apoptosis, autophagy and mitochondrial physiology in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that miR-335-5p was downregulated in ALS serum. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with a specific inhibitor of miR-335-5p and showed abnormal mitochondrial morphology, with an increment of reactive species of oxygen and superoxide dismutase activity. Pro-apoptotic caspases-3 and 7 also showed an increased activity in transfected cells. The downregulation of miR-335-5p, which has an effect on mitophagy, autophagy and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells could have a role in the motor neuron loss observed in ALS."
"Regulation of mitosis secures cellular integrity and its failure critically contributes to the development, maintenance, and treatment resistance of cancer. In yeast, the dual phosphatase Cdc14 controls mitotic progression by antagonizing Cdk1-mediated protein phosphorylation. By contrast, specific mitotic functions of the mammalian Cdc14 orthologue CDC14B have remained largely elusive. Here, we find that CDC14B antagonizes CDK1-mediated activating mitotic phosphorylation of the deubiquitinase USP9X at serine residue 2563, which we show to be essential for USP9X to mediate mitotic survival. Starting from an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach, we specify Wilms’ tumor protein 1 (WT1) as the relevant substrate that becomes deubiquitylated and stabilized by serine 2563-phosphorylated USP9X in mitosis. We further demonstrate that WT1 functions as a mitotic transcription factor and specify CXCL8/IL-8 as a target gene of WT1 that conveys mitotic survival. Together, we describe a ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway that directs a mitosis-specific transcription program to regulate mitotic survival."
"ObjectiveTo assess the cardiac function and prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) in twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) survivors.Study designProspective follow-up of TTTS pregnancies treated with laser surgery (2015–2018). Echocardiography was performed 1 day and 1 month after birth (corrected for prematurity). Results were compared with a control group of age-matched uncomplicated monochorionic twin-pairs at 1 month.ResultEighty-nine TTTS (168 neonates) and nine control pregnancies (18 neonates) were enrolled. CHD birth prevalence was 9.2% (8/87) in recipients and 13.6% (11/81) in donors (p = 0.37). Four of 19 (21%) were detected prenatally, all pulmonary stenosis. Donors had lower aortic peak velocities compared with recipients at day 1 (0.66 ± 0.15 m/s vs 0.71 ± 0.19 m/s, p = 0.04) and 1 month (1.04 ± 0.21 m/s vs 1.11 ± 0.18 m/s, p = 0.02), but not compared with controls.ConclusionCHD prevalence in TTTS survivors is high, with a low prenatal detection of minor abnormalities. Follow-up fetal echocardiograms and a postnatal echocardiogram should be offered."
"Composite follicular lymphoma with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (FL/DLBCL) is uncommonly found on lymph node biopsy and represents a rare haematological malignancy. We aim to examine clinico-pathological features of patients with FL/DLBCL and investigate predictors of survival outcome. We included in our retrospective study patients with histologically-proven FL/DLBCL at diagnosis (n = 106) and who were subsequently treated with rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy from 2002–2017 at the National Cancer Centre. The cohort consisted of 34 women and 72 men with a median age of 59 years (range, 24–82). In a multivariate model inclusive of known clinico-pathological parameters at diagnosis, advanced stage (p = 0.0136), presence of MYC and/or BCL6 rearrangement (p = 0.0376) and presence of B symptoms (p = 0.0405) were independently prognostic for worse overall survival (OS). The only remaining independent prognostic variables for worse OS after including first-line treatment data in the model were use of chemotherapy regimens other than R-CHOP (p = 0.0360) and lack of complete response to chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) besides the presence of B symptoms (p = 0.0022). We generated a Clinico-Genotypic Index by point-wise addition of all five adverse parameters (score of 0–1, 2, 3, 4–5) which revealed four prognostic risk groups with a predicted 5-year OS of 100%, 62%, 40% and 0% (p < 0.0001) accounting for 50.0%, 24.5%, 18.9% and 6.6% of the cohort respectively. We propose that R-CHOP should be the recommended first-line regimen for composite FL/DLBCL."
"BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PDAC) is the most lethal malignancy. New treatment options for it are urgently required. The aim was to develop an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) targeting glypican-1 (GPC-1) as a new therapy for PDAC.MethodsWe evaluated GPC-1 expression in resected PDAC specimens and PDAC cell lines. We then measured the antitumour effect of anti-GPC-1 monoclonal antibody conjugated with the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) in vitro and in vivo.ResultsGPC-1 was overexpressed in most primary PDAC cells and tissues. The PDAC cell lines BxPC-3 and T3M-4 strongly expressed GPC-1 relative to SUIT-2 cells. Compared with control ADC, GPC-1-ADC showed a potent antitumour effect against BxPC-3 and T3M-4, but little activity against SUIT-2 cells. In the xenograft and patient-derived tumour models, GPC-1-ADC significantly and potently inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner. GPC-1-ADC-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest was detected in the tumour tissues of GPC-1-ADC-treated mice relative to those of control-ADC-treated mice.ConclusionsGPC-1-ADC showed significant tumour growth inhibition against GPC-1-positive pancreatic cell lines and patient-derived, GPC-1-positive pancreatic cancer tissues. Our preclinical data demonstrated that targeting GPC-1 with ADC is a promising therapy for patients with GPC-1-positive pancreatic cancer."
"Aerosol inhalation is a promising strategy for the delivery of antibiotic agents. The efficacy of antibiotic treatment by aerosol inhalation is reduced by the formation of microbial biofilms in the respiratory system and excessive airway mucus build-up. Various approaches have been taken in order to overcome this barrier. In this in vitro study, we used hypertonic saline (7%, by weight), a low cost Food and Drug Administration-approved reagent, as an aerosol carrier to study its effects with the antibiotic, gentamicin, on the most common respiratory opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, present in the mucus. The results indicated that the hypertonic saline aerosol containing gentamicin, a low cost antibiotic, significantly eliminated biofilm growth by ~3-fold, compared to the regular saline aerosol containing gentamicin. In addition to enhancing the penetration efficiency of drug molecules by 70%, bacterial motility also decreased (~50%) after treatment with aerosolised hypertonic saline. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that hypertonic saline can significantly enhance the efficacy of antibiotic aerosols, which may contribute to the current use of inhaled therapeutic compounds."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor in China. In the present study, we aimed to construct and verify a prediction model of recurrence in HCC patients using databases (TCGA, AMC and Inserm) and machine learning methods and obtain the gene signature that could predict early relapse of HCC. Statistical methods, such as feature selection, survival analysis and Chi-Square test in R software, were used to analyze and select mutant genes related to disease free survival (DFS), race and vascular invasion. In addition, whole-exome sequencing was performed on 10 HCC patients recruited from our center, and the sequencing results were compared with the databases. Using the databases and machine learning methods, the prediction model of recurrence was constructed and optimized, and the selected mutant genes were verified in the test group. The accuracy of prediction was 74.19%. Moreover, these 10 patients from our center were used to verify these mutant genes and the prediction model, and a success rate of 80% was achieved. Collectively, we discovered recurrence-related genes and established recurrence prediction model of recurrence for HCC patients, which could provide significant guidance for clinical prediction of recurrence."
"Our aim was to identify optimal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) threshold values that distinguish disease severity progression in patients with co-existing systolic heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to evaluate the impact of the cut-off determined on the prognosis of hospitalizations. We evaluated 40 patients (30 men and 10 woman) with HF and COPD through pulmonary function testing, doppler echocardiography and maximal incremental CPET on a cycle ergometer. Several significant CPET threshold values were identified in detecting a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 1.6 L: 1) oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) < 1.3; and 2) circulatory power (CP) < 2383 mmHg.mlO2.kg−1. CPET significant threshold values in identifying a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 39% were: 1) OUES: < 1.3; 2) CP < 2116 mmHg.mlO2.kg−1.min−1 and minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (V̇E/V̇CO2) slope>38. The 15 (38%) patients hospitalized during follow-up (8 ± 2 months). In the hospitalizations analysis, LVEF < 39% and FEV1 < 1.6, OUES < 1.3, CP < 2116 mmHg.mlO2.kg−1.min−1 and V̇E/V̇CO2 > 38 were a strong risk predictor for hospitalization (P ≤ 0.050). The CPET response effectively identified worsening disease severity in patients with a HF-COPD phenotype. LVEF, FEV1, CP, OUES, and the V̇E/V̇CO2 slope may be particularly useful in the clinical assessment and strong risk predictor for hospitalization."
"Intensive-care clinicians are presented with large quantities of measurements from multiple monitoring systems. The limited ability of humans to process complex information hinders early recognition of patient deterioration, and high numbers of monitoring alarms lead to alarm fatigue. We used machine learning to develop an early-warning system that integrates measurements from multiple organ systems using a high-resolution database with 240 patient-years of data. It predicts 90% of circulatory-failure events in the test set, with 82% identified more than 2 h in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.63. On average, the system raises 0.05 alarms per patient and hour. The model was externally validated in an independent patient cohort. Our model provides early identification of patients at risk for circulatory failure with a much lower false-alarm rate than conventional threshold-based systems."
"Caveolin-1 (CAV1) enhanced migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells is inhibited by co-expression of the glycoprotein E-cadherin. Although the two proteins form a multiprotein complex that includes β-catenin, it remained unclear how this would contribute to blocking the metastasis promoting function of CAV1. Here, we characterized by mass spectrometry the protein composition of CAV1 immunoprecipitates from B16F10 murine melanoma cells expressing or not E-cadherin. The novel protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 was identified by mass spectrometry analysis exclusively in co-immunoprecipitates of CAV1 with E-cadherin. Interestingly, PTPN14 is implicated in controlling metastasis, but only few known PTPN14 substrates exist. We corroborated by western blotting experiments that PTPN14 and CAV1 co-inmunoprecipitated in the presence of E-cadherin in B16F10 melanoma and other cancer cells. Moreover, the CAV1(Y14F) mutant protein was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPN14 even in the absence of E-cadherin, and overexpression of PTPN14 reduced CAV1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14, as well as suppressed CAV1-enhanced cell migration, invasion and Rac-1 activation in B16F10, metastatic colon [HT29(US)] and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Finally, PTPN14 overexpression in B16F10 cells reduced the ability of CAV1 to induce metastasis in vivo. In summary, we identify here CAV1 as a novel substrate for PTPN14 and show that overexpression of this phosphatase suffices to reduce CAV1-induced metastasis."
"Monocytes contribute to immune responses as a source for subsets of dendritic cells and macrophages. Human blood monocytes are classified as classical, non-classical and intermediate cells. However, the particular functions of these subsets have been hard to define, with conflicting results and significant overlaps. One likely reason for these ambiguities is in the heterogeneity of these monocyte subsets regrouping cells with divergent functions. To better define monocyte populations, we have analysed expression of 17 markers by multicolour flow cytometry in samples obtained from 28 control donors. Data acquisition was tailored to detect populations present at low frequencies. Our results reveal the existence of novel monocyte subsets detected as larger CD14+ cells that were CD16+ or CD16neg. These large monocytes differed from regular, smaller monocytes with respect to expression of various cell surface molecules, such as FcR, chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules. Unsupervised multidimensional analysis confirmed the existence of large monocytes and revealed interindividual variations that were grouped according to unique patterns of expression of adhesion molecules CD62L, CD49d, and CD43. Distinct inflammatory responses to TLR agonists were found in small and large monocytes. Overall, refining the definition of monocyte subsets should lead to the identification of populations with specific functions."
"The influenza virus genome consists of eight viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), each consisting of a copy of the polymerase, one of the genomic RNA segments and multiple copies of the nucleoprotein arranged in a double helical conformation. vRNPs are macromolecular machines responsible for messenger RNA synthesis and genome replication, that is, the formation of progeny vRNPs. Here, we describe the structural basis of the transcription process. The mechanism, which we call the ‘processive helical track’, is based on the extreme flexibility of the helical part of the vRNP that permits a sliding movement between both antiparallel nucleoprotein-RNA strands, thereby allowing the polymerase to move over the genome while bound to both RNA ends. Accordingly, we demonstrate that blocking this movement leads to inhibition of vRNP transcriptional activity. This mechanism also reveals a critical role of the nucleoprotein in maintaining the double helical structure throughout the copying process to make the RNA template accessible to the polymerase."
"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) refer to patient perceived and reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and symptom burden. PROs have become an important measure in oncologic care to identify the impact of the disease and its treatment on a patient’s health status. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an aggressive and potentially curative therapy for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. A common complication of HCT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which can be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, as well as a wide spectrum of physical and psychosocial effects. Quality of life and symptom burden have been shown to be important measures in the study of posttransplant complications, including chronic GVHD. We review the need for a novel tool in acute GVHD to capture disease symptoms and HRQOL to better understand patient symptoms, disease trajectory and outcome."
"A flow cytometry-based method was developed to quantify in vivo circulating neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) levels in plasma and compare them in patients with different chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Seventeen asthmatic and 11 control children, 12 adult controls, 46 asthmatic, 6 COPD and 6 adult patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) were recruited in the study. The presence of NETs in unstimulated cell-free plasma was confirmed and visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. No significant differences were found in plasma NET levels between children and adults, children with or without asthma and adults with or without asthma, COPD or ACOS. When asthmatic patients were stratified according to their disease severity the average plasma NET level was significantly higher in asthmatic patients with more serious symptoms (adjusted p = 0.027). Patients with poorer pulmonary functions had higher plasma NET levels which negatively correlated with the FEV1 values (r = −0.39, p = 0.002). Patients who were medicated daily with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) had significantly lower average plasma NET level than patients who did not or just occasionally used ICS (p = 0.027). If further studies confirm the NET-lowering effect of ICS in the circulation, it can be utilized in diseases where NETosis contributes to the pathogenesis."
"Although supplemental oxygen is required to promote survival of severely premature infants, hyperoxia is simultaneously harmful to premature developing tissues such as in the retina. Here we report the effect of hyperoxia on central carbon metabolism in primary mouse Müller glial cells and a human Müller glia cell line (M10-M1 cells). We found decreased flux from glycolysis entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle in Müller cells accompanied by increased glutamine consumption in response to hyperoxia. In hyperoxia, anaplerotic catabolism of glutamine by Müller cells increased ammonium release two-fold. Hyperoxia induces glutamine-fueled anaplerosis that reverses basal Müller cell metabolism from production to consumption of glutamine."
"The underlying reasons behind the unprecedented increase of the mortality rates due to the opioid epidemics in the United States are still not fully uncovered. Most efforts have been focused on targeting opioids, but there is little information about vulnerable populations at high risk of opioid abuse and death. In this study, we used data from the Ohio Department of Health for deaths caused by prescription opioids from 2010–2017 to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the opioid overdose epidemic. Our results showed a rapid increase in prescription opioid death rates among the white male population aged 30–39 but also a considerable increase among the black male population with an exponential growth trend. Our geospatial analysis suggests that the increasing rates of the opioid overdose epidemic in Ohio were driven by the epidemic hotspot areas. Our findings highlight the relevance of prioritizing public health measures targeting specific locations and vulnerable populations to mitigate the current opioids crisis."
"The regulation of bone formation and detailed mechanisms are still largely elusive, and the roles of microRNAs in this process have attracted much attention. Recently, a specific subtype of CD31hiendomucinhi (CD31hiEMCNhi) endothelium has been identified to promote bone formation, together with osteoblast development. However, the role of microRNA143 in the generation of CD31hi EMCNhi endothelium and bone formation remains unknown. In this study, we found that miR-143 was expressed both in osteoblast cells and CD31hiEMCNhi endothelial cells. Serum miR-143 level was negatively correlated with age in humans. Overexpression of miR-143 promoted osteoblast formation and angiogenic effects. Furthermore, CD31hiEmcnhi vessels and osteoblast formation were significantly inhibited in miR-143 knockout mice. Mechanistically, inhibitor HDAC7 was directly targeted by miR-143 and knockdown of HDAC7 was found to rescue the function of miR-143 deficiency. Thus, miR-143 promotes angiogenesis coupling with osteoblast differentiation by targeting HDAC7, which may serve as a potential target in angiogenic and osteogenic diseases."
"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder affecting almost 40% of adult patients with epilepsy. Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common histopathological abnormality found in patients with MTLE. HS is characterised by extensive neuronal loss in different hippocampus sub-regions. In this study, we used laser microdissection-based microproteomics to determine the protein abundances in different regions and layers of the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) in an electric stimulation rodent model which displays classical HS damage similar to that found in patients with MTLE. Our results indicate that there are differences in the proteomic profiles of different layers (granule cell and molecular), as well as different regions, of the DG (ventral and dorsal). We have identified new signalling pathways and proteins present in specific layers and regions of the DG, such as PARK7, RACK1, and connexin 31/gap junction. We also found two major signalling pathways that are common to all layers and regions: inflammation and energy metabolism. Finally, our results highlight the utility of high-throughput microproteomics and spatial-limited isolation of tissues in the study of complex disorders to fully appreciate the large biological heterogeneity present in different cell populations within the central nervous system."
"In the past three decades, extraordinary advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of, and treatment options for, inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. The use of methotrexate and subsequently biologic therapies (such as TNF inhibitors, among others) and oral small molecules have substantially improved clinical outcomes for many patients with inflammatory arthritis; for others, however, these agents do not substantially improve their symptoms. The emerging field of pharmacomicrobiomics, which investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs, has already provided important insights into these therapeutics. Pharmacomicrobiomic studies have demonstrated that human gut microorganisms and their enzymatic products can affect the bioavailability, clinical efficacy and toxicity of a wide array of drugs through direct and indirect mechanisms. This discipline promises to facilitate the advent of microbiome-based precision medicine approaches in inflammatory arthritis, including strategies for predicting response to treatment and for modulating the microbiome to improve response to therapy or reduce drug toxicity."
"In this study, we sought to determine the burden and characteristics of orgasmic dysfunction (OD) and concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. In 2010, we assessed orgasmic and erectile function using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sociodemographic, clinical, and diabetes characteristics were compared by OD status (OD only, OD and ED, no ED or OD). Age-adjusted associations between risk factors and OD status were examined. OD and ED information was available from 563 men. Eighty-three men (14.7%) reported OD of whom 21 reported OD only and 62 reported OD and ED. Age-adjusted odds ratios demonstrated that men who reported OD only had higher odds of depression, low sexual desire, and decreased alcohol use compared with men reporting no dysfunction. Men with OD concomitant with ED had greater odds of elevated hemoglobin A1C, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and nephropathy. Men reporting both dysfunctions were also more likely to report smoking, lower urinary tract symptoms, and had greater odds of androgen deficiency than men with no sexual dysfunction. Men with longstanding T1D suffer from an increased burden of OD. Psychogenic factors predominate in men reporting OD only while men who present with concomitant ED report increased burden of diabetes severity, characteristics previously observed with incident ED. ED may be the central impediment to sexual function in men with OD and ED. Longitudinal studies to characterize OD and ED experience over time are warranted."
"Despite an excellent view of the glottis, technical difficulties with endotracheal tube delivery remains in GlideScope intubation. We evaluated whether a spiral-shape twisted tube can facilitate placement of the tracheal tube tip at the center of glottis opening compared to conventional tube for GlideScope intubation in infants. Eighty-six infants were randomly placed in either the conventional tube group (group C) or the twist tube group (group T). In group T, the shaft of the tube was manually twisted into a loose spiral shape. The primary outcome was the initial center location of the tube tip at the glottis opening, and the secondary outcome was total tube handling time. The initial center location rate of the tube tip at the glottis opening was significantly higher in group T than in group C (88% [38/43] vs. 47% [20/43], P < 0.001). In addition, total tube handling time (sec) was significantly shorter in group T than in group C (15.4 ± 4.7 vs. 18.2 ± 5.3, P = 0.012). In this study, the spiral shape twist tube successfully improved the rate of initial center location of the tube tip at glottis opening and facilitated tube delivery in GlideScope intubation in infants."
"AimsOver the past several decades, many antiobesity drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to unanticipated adverse events, often involving cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of cardiovascular safety signals with currently marketed antiobesity drugs.MethodsWe used the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and retrieved data from January 2013 through December 2018. We performed disproportionality analyses to detect cardiovascular safety signals with three antiobesity drugs recently approved for marketing: lorcaserin, naltrexone–bupropion, phentermine, and phentermine–topiramate. Three main cardiovascular outcomes were evaluated: valvular disorders, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, cardiac failure, and arrhythmia).ResultsDuring the evaluated period, a total of 6,787,840 adverse event reports were submitted to FAERS. Of these, 2687 involved lorcaserin, 3960 involved phentermine/phentermine–topiramate, and 2873 involved naltrexone–bupropion. Lorcaserin was associated with a significantly greater proportion of reports of valvular disorders (ROR = 4.39; 95% CI 2.72–5.07). None of the antiobesity drugs were associated with a safety signal for valvulopathy, PH, or other cardiovascular events.ConclusionsOur analyses revealed a signal for valvular disorders with lorcaserin and did not detect a safety signal for other cardiovascular events with recently approved antiobesity drugs. Further research is needed to explore and validate this signal."
"The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the dominant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the reason for the association between APOE4 and AD remains unclear. While much of the research has focused on the ability of the apoE4 protein to increase the aggregation and decrease the clearance of Aβ, there is also an abundance of data showing that APOE4 negatively impacts many additional processes in the brain, including bioenergetics. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of APOE4′s role in AD pathogenesis, we performed a transcriptomics analysis of APOE4 vs. APOE3 expression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and primary visual cortex (PVC) of aged APOE mice. This study revealed EC-specific upregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Follow-up analysis utilizing the Seahorse platform showed decreased mitochondrial respiration with age in the hippocampus and cortex of APOE4 vs. APOE3 mice, but not in the EC of these mice. Additional studies, as well as the original transcriptomics data, suggest that multiple bioenergetic pathways are differentially regulated by APOE4 expression in the EC of aged APOE mice in order to increase the mitochondrial coupling efficiency in this region. Given the importance of the EC as one of the first regions to be affected by AD pathology in humans, the observation that the EC is susceptible to differential bioenergetic regulation in response to a metabolic stressor such as APOE4 may point to a causative factor in the pathogenesis of AD."
"Excess bone marrow adiposity may have a negative effect on bone growth and development. The aim of this study was to determine whether a procedure using standard T1-weighted magnetic resonance images provides an accurate estimate of bone marrow fat in children with typical development and in children with mild spastic cerebral palsy (CP; n = 15/group; 4–11 y). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire T1-weighted images. It was also used to acquire fat and water images using an iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) technique. Bone marrow fat volume and fat fraction in the middle-third of the tibia were determined using the standard T1-weighted images (BMFVT1 and BMFFT1, respectively) and the fat and water images (BMFVIDEAL and BMFFIDEAL, respectively). In both groups, BMFVT1 was highly correlated with (both r > 0.99, p < 0.001) and not different from (both p > 0.05) BMFVIDEAL. In both groups, BMFFT1 was moderately correlated with (both r = 0.71, p < 0.01) and not different from (both p > 0.05) BMFFIDEAL. There was no group difference in BMFVT1 or BMFVIDEAL (both p > 0.05). BMFFIDEAL was higher in children with CP (p < 0.05), but there was no group difference in BMFFT1 (p > 0.05). We conclude that a procedure using standard T1-weighted magnetic resonance images can produce estimates of bone marrow fat volume similar to estimates from the IDEAL technique in children. However, it is less sensitive to variation in the bone marrow fat fraction."
"Simulations of visual impairment are used to educate and inform the public. However, evidence regarding their accuracy remains lacking. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of modern digital technologies to simulate the everyday difficulties caused by glaucoma. 23 normally sighted adults performed two everyday tasks that glaucoma patients often report difficulties with: a visual search task in which participants attempted to locate a mobile phone in virtual domestic environments (virtual reality (VR)), and a visual mobility task in which participants navigated a physical, room-scale environment, while impairments were overlaid using augmented reality (AR). On some trials, a gaze-contingent simulated scotoma—generated using perimetric data from a real patient with advanced glaucoma—was presented in either the superior or inferior hemifield. The main outcome measure was task completion time. Eye and head movements were also tracked and used to assess individual differences in looking behaviors. The results showed that the simulated impairments substantially impaired performance in both the VR (visual search) and AR (visual mobility) tasks (both P < 0.001). Furthermore, and in line with previous patient data: impairments were greatest when the simulated Visual Field Loss (VFL) was inferior versus superior (P < 0.001), participants made more eye and head movements in the inferior VFL condition (P < 0.001), and participants rated the inferior VFL condition as more difficult (P < 0.001). Notably, the difference in performance between the inferior and superior conditions was almost as great as the difference between a superior VFL and no impairment at all (VR: 71%; AR: 70%). We conclude that modern digital simulators are able to replicate and objectively quantify some of the key everyday difficulties associated with visual impairments. Advantages, limitations, and possible applications of current technologies are discussed. Instructions are also given for how to freely obtain the software described (OpenVisSim)."
"A case-controlled study was performed to evaluate taste and smell impairment, nausea or vomiting (NV) response to taste and smell and toleration to food texture, item and cooking method in hyperemesis gravidarum patients (HG) compared to gestation-matched controls from a university hospital and primary care clinic in Malaysia. Taste strips (4 base tastes), sniff sticks (16 selected smells) and a food-related questionnaire were used. 124 participants were recruited. Taste impairment was found in 13%(8/62) vs. 0%(0/62) P = 0.003 and the median for correct smell identification was 5[4–6] vs. 9[7–9] P < 0.001 in HG vs. controls. In HG, bitter was most likely (32%) and sweet taste least likely (5%) to provoke NV. In both arms, fish smell was most likely to provoke NV, 77% vs. 32% P < 0.001 and peppermint smell least likely 10% vs. 0% P = 0.012; NV response was significantly more likely for HG arm in 10/16 smells. In HG, worst and best NV responses to food-texture were pasty 69% and crunchy 26%; food-item, plain rice 71% and apple 16% and cooking-style, deep-frying 71% and steaming 55%. HG demonstrated taste and smell impairment and increased NV responses to many tastes and smells. Crunchy sweet uncooked food (apple or watermelon) maybe best tolerated in HG."
"Severe brain injuries can lead to long-lasting disorders of consciousness (DoC) such as vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). While behavioral assessment remains the gold standard to determine conscious state, EEG has proven to be a promising complementary tool to monitor the effect of new therapeutics. Encouraging results have been obtained with invasive electrical stimulation of the brain, and recent studies identified transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an effective approach in randomized controlled trials. This non-invasive and inexpensive tool may turn out to be the preferred treatment option. However, its mechanisms of action and physiological effects on brain activity remain unclear and debated. Here, we stimulated 60 DoC patients with the anode placed over left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a prospective open-label study. Clinical behavioral assessment improved in twelve patients (20%) and none deteriorated. This behavioral response after tDCS coincided with an enhancement of putative EEG markers of consciousness: in comparison with non-responders, responders showed increases of power and long-range cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the theta-alpha band, and a larger and more sustained P300 suggesting improved conscious access to auditory novelty. The EEG changes correlated with electric fields strengths in prefrontal cortices, and no correlation was found on the scalp. Taken together, this prospective intervention in a large cohort of DoC patients strengthens the validity of the proposed EEG signatures of consciousness, and is suggestive of a direct causal effect of tDCS on consciousness."
"Extracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is most commonly caused by MAP2K1 mutations in the endothelial cell. The purpose of this study was to determine if local tissue overgrowth associated with AVM is caused by direct or indirect effects of the MAP2K1 mutation (i.e., cell-autonomous or cell-non autonomous). Because cartilage does not have blood vessels, we studied ear AVMs to determine if overgrown cartilage contained AVM-causing mutations. Cartilage was separated from its surrounding tissue and isolated by laser capture microdissection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to identify MAP2K1 mutations. MAP2K1 (p.K57N) variants were present in the tissue adjacent to the cartilage [mutant allele frequency (MAF) 6–8%], and were enriched in endothelial cells (MAF 51%) compared to non-endothelial cells (MAF 0%). MAP2K1 mutations were not identified in the overgrown cartilage, and thus local cartilage overgrowth likely results from the effects of adjacent mutant blood vessels (i.e., cell-non autonomous)."
"Effective clinician-patient communication is particularly important in ophthalmology where long-term adherence to treatment is often required. However, in the context of increasingly pressurised clinics, there is a tendency to resort to written information leaflets not suited to patients with visual impairment, non-English speakers or those with low levels of literacy. Video-based media could be harnessed to enhance clinician-patient communication. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of using video-based media for patient education in ophthalmology. A pre-defined search strategy was used by two independent researchers to systematically review the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases. Eligible articles included peer-reviewed studies involving ophthalmology patients, who received a solely video-based educational intervention to assess for improvement in patient knowledge, behaviour and overall health-related outcomes. The search yielded 481 studies of which 31 passed initial screening. Following full-text analysis, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which seven studies (58.3%) were randomised controlled trials. The majority of studies (58.3%) reported outcomes on patient comprehension with 5/7 (71%) showing statistically significant improvement after video intervention. Four studies (33.3%) reported on patient performance in a task (e.g. drop application method) or overall health-related outcome with 2/4 (50%) showing statistically significant improvement after intervention. Though more evidence is needed, the use of video-based media appears to be effective in improving patient understanding and in certain cases may ameliorate overall outcome. There is a paucity of well-designed studies and future research is required to fully examine the role of video-based media in patient education."
"Reconstruction of composite oral and maxillofacial defects using free flaps is challenging. The key to such delicate reconstruction lies in the evaluation of the defect. However, few reports have described the clinical classification of these difficult defects. In this study, we proposed a classification method and developed different reconstructive solutions using free flap techniques according to this classification. This classification method was established based on two parameters (the elements and distribution of the missing tissues). Among the 17 patients with composite oral and maxillofacial defects included in this study, 8 patients presented with type A defects, one patient presented with a type B defect, and the other 8 patients presented with type C defects. No type D defects were observed in this study. Three types of free flaps were used to reconstruct the respective types of composite defects. Perforator-based ALT flaps were used to reconstruct Type A defects. Branch-based ALT flaps were used to reconstruct Type B defects. For Type C defects, two reconstructive solutions were used, including a well-designed fibular flap and a perforator-based ALT flap with or without a metal plate for bony reconstruction. All flaps survived after surgery. This classification system may help select and design specific free flaps for reconstructing composite oral and maxillofacial defects."
"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial biomarkers and regulators in many cancers. Novel lncRNAs involved in the initiation and progression of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) need to be investigated. Here, we report that the long non-coding RNA LINC01352 is markedly downregulated by HBV/HBx (HBV X protein) in HCC cells and clinical samples. The LINC01352 expression level in HCC is an independent prognostic factor for survival. We found that HBx suppresses LINC01352 promoter activity by forming a complex with the estrogen receptor (ERα). Furthermore, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we confirmed that HBx promotes HCC cell growth and metastasis by inhibiting LINC01352 expression. Further investigation revealed that the downregulation of LINC01352, which acts as an endogenous sponge, increases the expression of miR-135b, leading to the reduced production of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), consequently activating Wnt/β-catenin signalling to facilitate tumour progression. These findings strongly suggest that the LINC01352-miR-135b-APC axis regulated by the HBx/ERα complex acts as an important pathogenic factor for tumour progression, which may help provide a theoretical basis for the identification of new therapeutic targets for HBV-related HCC."
"Radioresistance becomes the major obstacle to reduce tumor recurrence and improve prognosis in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Thus new strategies for radioresistant ESCC are urgently needed. Herein, we reported that tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3) serves as a key regulator of radioresistance in ESCC. TRIB3 is overexpressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. High expression of TRIB3 significantly correlates with poor radiotherapy response and prognosis in ESCC patients. Upregulation of TRIB3 in ESCC cells conferred radioresistance in vitro and in vivo by interacting with TAZ thus impeding β-TrCP-mediated TAZ ubiquitination and degradation. Conversely, silencing TRIB3 sensitized ESCC cells to ionizing radiation. More importantly, TRIB3 was significantly correlated with TAZ activation in ESCC biopsies, and patients with high expression of both TRIB3 and TAZ suffered the worst radiotherapy response and survival. Our study uncovers the critical mechanism of ESCC resistance to radiotherapy, and provides a new pharmacological opportunity for developing a mechanism-based strategy to eliminate radioresistant ESCC in clinical practice."
"The limitations of stem cells have led researchers to investigate the secretome, which is the secretory materials in stem cells, since the principal mechanism of action of stem cells is mediated by the secretome. In this study, we determined the antifibrotic potential of the secretome released from miR-150-transfected adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs). The secretome released from ASCs that were transfected with antifibrotic miR-150 was obtained (referred to as the miR-150 secretome). To validate the antifibrotic effects of the miR-150 secretome, we generated in vitro and in vivo models of liver fibrosis by treating human hepatic stellate cells (LX2 cells) with thioacetamide (TAA) and subcutaneous injection of TAA into mice, respectively. In the in vitro model, more significant reductions in the expression of fibrosis-related markers, such as TGFβ, Col1A1, and α-SMA, were observed by using the miR-150 secretome than the control secretome, specifically in TAA-treated LX2 cells. In the in vivo model, infusion of the miR-150 secretome into mice with liver fibrosis abrogated the increase in serum levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, and induced increased expression of antifibrotic, proliferation, and antioxidant activity markers in the liver. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that the miR-150 secretome is superior to the naive secretome in terms of ameliorating liver fibrosis, minimizing systemic inflammatory responses, and promoting antioxidant enzyme expression. Therefore, we conclude that miR-150 transfection into ASCs has the potential to induce the release of secretory materials with enhanced antifibrotic, proliferative, and antioxidant properties."
"To investigate if there is evidence for a ‘legacy effect’ for blood pressure (BP) lowering treatment, that is, worse health outcomes from not initiating drug treatment at a systolic BP threshold of 140 mmHg in middle-age adults. We systematically reviewed studies comparing the effects of delayed BP treatment (placebo/untreated during the trial or no previous treatment at trial entry) vs. early treatment (actively treated during the trial or previous BP treatment at trial entry) on mortality in the short term (5-year in-trial period) and long term (≥10 years in total period). The data were pooled using Peto ORs. A subgroup analysis by 10-year Framingham risk score was performed. Three studies (ALLHAT, Oslo and PREVEND-IT) involving 4746 participants were included. The results were heavily influenced by the ALLHAT trial. We found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between ‘delayed BP’ and ‘early treatment’ in the short-term OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.68–1.32) or long-term OR 0.90 (95% CI 0.78–1.04), with similar results for mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The effects of delayed BP lowering treatment on long-term all-cause and CVD mortality did not vary with baseline risk of CVD. The review showed no clinically adverse ‘legacy effect’ on mortality or major CVD event from not treating middle-aged adults at a systolic BP threshold of 140 mmHg or over. The results were consistent for all CVD risk subgroups. Although these studies are non-randomised post-hoc analyses, they may allay concerns that early treatment of elevated systolic BP is necessary to prevent CVD events in primary prevention populations."
"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections result in 887,000 deaths annually. The central challenge in curing HBV is eradication of the stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the viral genome, which is formed by the repair of lesion-bearing HBV relaxed circular DNA delivered by the virions to hepatocytes. The complete and minimal set of host factors involved in cccDNA formation is unknown, largely due to the lack of a biochemical system that fully reconstitutes cccDNA formation. Here, we have developed experimental systems where various HBV relaxed-circular-DNA substrates are repaired to form cccDNA by both cell extracts and purified human proteins. Using yeast- and human-extract screenings, we identified five core components of lagging-strand synthesis as essential for cccDNA formation: proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the replication factor C complex, DNA polymerase δ, flap endonuclease 1 and DNA ligase 1. We reconstituted cccDNA formation with purified human homologues, establishing these as a minimal set of factors for cccDNA formation. We further demonstrated that treatment with the DNA-polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin diminishes cccDNA formation both in biochemical assays and in HBV-infected human cells. Together, our findings define key components in HBV cccDNA formation."
"ObjectiveTo estimate the association of continuity of neonatologist care with caloric intake and growth velocity (GV) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.Study designWe created a daily continuity index (DCI) defined as the number of days the neonatologist worked in the previous week. We estimated the independent associations between this index and infants’ daily caloric intake (kcal/kg/day) and GV (g/kg/day) through the first 6 weeks of life using regression analyses.ResultsTwenty-eight neonatologists cared for 115 infants over 4643 patient-days. The DCI was independently associated with increased caloric intake (β = 1.27 kcal/kg/day per each day of continuity, p < 10−4); this effect was magnified (β = 3.33, p < 10−4) in the first 2 weeks. No association was observed between the index and GV.ConclusionsNeonatologist continuity may contribute to caloric intake in VLBW infants. Quality metrics focused on this area of health care delivery warrant further discovery."
"Pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating disease where no treatment exists, involves the compartmentalization of the nuclear protein TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) in the cytoplasm which is promoted by its aberrant phosphorylation and others posttranslational modifications. Recently, it was reported that CK-1δ (protein casein kinase-1δ) is able to phosphorylate TDP-43. Here, the preclinical efficacy of a benzothiazole-based CK-1δ inhibitor IGS-2.7, both in a TDP-43 (A315T) transgenic mouse and in a human cell-based model of ALS, is shown. Treatment with IGS-2.7 produces a significant preservation of motor neurons in the anterior horn at lumbar level, a decrease in both astroglial and microglial reactivity in this area, and in TDP-43 phosphorylation in spinal cord samples. Furthermore, the recovery of TDP-43 homeostasis (phosphorylation and localization) in a human-based cell model from ALS patients after treatment with IGS-2.7 is also reported. Moreover, we have shown a trend to increase in CK-1δ mRNA in spinal cord and significantly in frontal cortex of sALS cases. All these data show for the first time the in vivo modulation of TDP-43 toxicity by CK-1δ inhibition with IGS-2.7, which may explain the benefits in the preservation of spinal motor neurons and point to the relevance of CK-1δ inhibitors in a future disease-modifying treatment for ALS."
"BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of sequential of abiraterone (ABI) and enzalutamide (ENZ) therapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).MethodsPUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published prior to December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared overall survival (OS), combined progression-free survival (PFS), combined prostate specific antigen (PSA)-PFS, and PSA response rates in CRPC patients receiving sequential ABI/ENZ or vice versa. PSA response to both the first and second agents was defined as a >50% decrease in PSA achieved with each of these agents. Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes.ResultsTen studies with 1096 patients were eligible for the systematic review and eight studies with 643 patients for the meta-analysis. The ABI-to-ENZ sequence was significantly associated with better PFS (pooled hazard ratio (HR): 0.62, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.49–0.78, P < 0.001), and PSA–PFS (pooled HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.38–0.61, P < 0.001) than the ENZ-to-ABI sequence. PSA response rates of both agents were significantly better with the ABI-to-ENZ sequence (risk ratio: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09–0.47, P < 0.001). In contrast, treatment sequence was not significantly associated with OS (pooled HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59–1.01, P = 0.055).ConclusionsABI-to-ENZ sequential therapy in patients with CRPC was associated with better PFS, PSA–PFS, and PSA response rates. Regardless of sequencing, response to drug therapy was transient for both ABI and ENZ when either agent was used as a secondary therapy. Despite this, treatment sequencing is important to achieve the maximum possible benefit from available drugs in CRPC."
"Latent infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with B cell malignancy. We examined whether dasatinib, a multi kinase inhibitor, which is broadly used for chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia is effective on EBV-positive B cell malignancies, using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro and in vivo. As a result, in vitro experiments showed that dasatinib induced cell death of the EBV-LCLs which was not accompanied with a lytic reactivation of EBVs. To evaluate the effectiveness in EBV latency type III represented by immunodeficiency lymphoma, LCL-inoculated immunodeficient NOD/shi-scid/Il2rgnul (NOG) mice were treated with dasatinib. However, in vivo experiments revealed that dasatinib treatment exacerbated tumor cell infiltration into the spleen of LCL-inoculated NOG mice, whereas tumor size at the inoculated site was not affected by the treatment. These results suggest that dasatinib exacerbates the pathogenesis at least in some situations although the drug is effective in vitro. Hence, we should carefully examine a possibility of dasatinib repositioning for EBV+ B cell malignancies."
"The emergence of digital pathology has opened new horizons for histopathology. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are able to operate on digitized slides to assist pathologists with different tasks. Whereas AI-involving classification and segmentation methods have obvious benefits for image analysis, image search represents a fundamental shift in computational pathology. Matching the pathology of new patients with already diagnosed and curated cases offers pathologists a new approach to improve diagnostic accuracy through visual inspection of similar cases and computational majority vote for consensus building. In this study, we report the results from searching the largest public repository (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) of whole-slide images from almost 11,000 patients. We successfully indexed and searched almost 30,000 high-resolution digitized slides constituting 16 terabytes of data comprised of 20 million 1000 × 1000 pixels image patches. The TCGA image database covers 25 anatomic sites and contains 32 cancer subtypes. High-performance storage and GPU power were employed for experimentation. The results were assessed with conservative “majority voting” to build consensus for subtype diagnosis through vertical search and demonstrated high accuracy values for both frozen section slides (e.g., bladder urothelial carcinoma 93%, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 97%, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma 99%) and permanent histopathology slides (e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma 98%, skin cutaneous melanoma 99%, and thymoma 100%). The key finding of this validation study was that computational consensus appears to be possible for rendering diagnoses if a sufficiently large number of searchable cases are available for each cancer subtype."
"Surgery for metastatic pancreatic cancer remains controversial as the survival benefit is questionable. The aim of the present study was to analyze the survival of these patients using data extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program database. Further, studies on resection for metastatic disease to the lung were systematically reviewed. A total of 11,541 cases with synchronous distant metastasis were analyzed. The median survival of single-organ metastasis was better than of multi-organ metastasis (single-organ 4.0 ± 0.07 months, two-organs 3.0 ± 0.13 months, three/four-organs 2.0 ± 0.19 months; p < 0.0001). Single organ lung metastasis had longer median survival times compared to the other sites (lung 6.0 ± 0.32 months, HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78–0.97; p = 0.013). Resection of the primary tumor was associated with longer survival in synchronous single-organ metastasis to the lung compared to no resection (14.0 ± 1.93 months vs 6.0 ± 0.31 months, p < 0.0001). A systematic literature review identified 79 cases of metachronous lung metastasis with a survival of 120.0 ± 6.32 months and 83.0 ± 24.84 months following resection of the primary tumor and metastasis, respectively. Lower TNM staging, longer interval to metastasis, and single metastatic lesion correlated with better survival. Resection in highly selected pancreatic cancer patients with synchronous and metachronous lung only metastasis might confer a survival benefit and should be considered on an individual basis."
"Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cell metabolism can be regulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), but the mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we show that CAFs regulate malignant cell metabolism through pathways under the control of FAK. In breast and pancreatic cancer patients we find that low FAK expression, specifically in the stromal compartment, predicts reduced overall survival. In mice, depletion of FAK in a subpopulation of CAFs regulates paracrine signals that increase malignant cell glycolysis and tumour growth. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis in our mouse model identifies metabolic alterations which are reflected at the transcriptomic level in patients with low stromal FAK. Mechanistically we demonstrate that FAK-depletion in CAFs increases chemokine production, which via CCR1/CCR2 on cancer cells, activate protein kinase A, leading to enhanced malignant cell glycolysis. Our data uncover mechanisms whereby stromal fibroblasts regulate cancer cell metabolism independent of genetic mutations in cancer cells."
"The presence of antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) has been documented in Takayasu arteritis (TAK), a chronic granulomatous vasculitis. Here, we identify cell-surface autoantigens using an expression cloning system. A cDNA library of endothelial cells is retrovirally transfected into a rat myeloma cell line from which AECA-positive clones are sorted with flow cytometry. Four distinct AECA-positive clones are isolated, and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI) are identified as endothelial autoantigens. Autoantibodies against EPCR and SR-BI are detected in 34.6% and 36.5% of cases, respectively, with minimal overlap (3.8%). Autoantibodies against EPCR are also detected in ulcerative colitis, the frequent comorbidity of TAK. In mechanistic studies, EPCR and SR-BI function as negative regulators of endothelial activation. EPCR has also an effect on human T cells and impair Th17 differentiation. Autoantibodies against EPCR and SR-BI block the functions of their targets, thereby promoting pro-inflammatory phenotype."
"There are a few studies about the clinical impacts of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) at discharge with the occurrence of worsening renal function (WRF) on mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). We divided total 301 patients with acute decompensated HF into four groups by the median value (278.7 pg/mL) of BNP level at discharge and by the occurrence of WRF. WRF developed in 100 patients (33.2%). Cardiovascular mortality was significantly different between the four groups (P = 0.0002). Patients with WRF and elevated BNP had a higher cardiovascular mortality than patients without WRF and elevated BNP in Cox proportional hazard models (hazard ratio [HR], 10.48; 95% confident interval [95% CI], 1.27–225.53; P = 0.03). Patients with either WRF or elevated BNP did not have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to patients without WRF and elevated BNP. Regarding HF readmission and cardiovascular mortality, patients with WRF and elevated BNP had the highest risk (HR, 5.17; 95% CI, 2.07–14.30, P = 0.0003) and patients with either WRF or elevated BNP had a higher risk than patients without WRF and elevated BNP. The occurrence of WRF combined with elevated BNP at discharge was associated with increased 1-year cardiovascular mortality and HF readmission."
"ObjectivesTo assess effects of egg-based versus non-egg, higher-carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast meals on cardiometabolic health markers in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome.MethodsThis randomized, crossover study included two 4-week dietary interventions, separated by a ≥4-week washout. Subjects incorporated into their habitual diets breakfast meals containing either 2 eggs/day for 6 days/week (Egg condition), or energy-matched, non-egg, higher-CHO-based foods (Non-Egg condition). Dietary intakes, insulin sensitivity, and other CHO metabolism indices, lipid biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and blood pressures were measured.ResultsThirty men and women with mean age 54.1 ± 1.9 years and body mass index 31.9 ± 0.7 kg/m2 provided data. Neither diet condition significantly altered insulin sensitivity indices, but the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance was significantly (p = 0.028) higher after the Non-Egg vs. the Egg condition. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was decreased from baseline (119 mg/dL) by 2.9 and 6.0% with Egg and Non-Egg breakfasts, respectively (p = 0.023). Systolic blood pressure was reduced from baseline (127 mm Hg) by 2.7 and 0.0% with Egg and Non-Egg, respectively (p = 0.018). Diet records indicated 149 kcal/day higher (p = 0.008) energy intake from non-study foods during the Egg condition; however, weight change from baseline did not differ between conditions.ConclusionCompared with the baseline diet, consumption of 12 eggs/week for 4 weeks at breakfast was associated with less reduction in LDL-C, and more lowering of systolic blood pressure, than observed with non-egg-based, energy-matched, control foods higher in CHO."
"The human spinal column is a dynamic, segmented, bony, and cartilaginous structure that protects the neurologic system and simultaneously provides balance and flexibility. Children with developmental disorders that affect the patterning or shape of the spine can be at risk of neurologic and other physiologic dysfunctions. The most common developmental disorder of the spine is scoliosis, a lateral deformity in the shape of the spinal column. Scoliosis may be part of the clinical spectrum that is observed in many developmental disorders, but typically presents as an isolated symptom in otherwise healthy adolescent children. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has defied understanding in part due to its genetic complexity. Breakthroughs have come from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next generation sequencing (NGS) of human AIS cohorts, as well as investigations of animal models. These studies have identified genetic associations with determinants of cartilage biogenesis and development of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Current evidence suggests that a fraction of AIS cases may arise from variation in factors involved in the structural integrity and homeostasis of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we review the development of the spine and spinal cartilages, the composition of the cartilage ECM, the so-called “matrisome” and its functions, and the players involved in the genetic architecture of AIS. We also propose a molecular model by which the cartilage matrisome of the IVD contributes to AIS susceptibility."
"Mastitis in dairy cattle is extremely costly both in economic and welfare terms and is one of the most significant drivers of antimicrobial usage in dairy cattle. A critical step in the prevention of mastitis is the diagnosis of the predominant route of transmission of pathogens into either contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV), with environmental being further subdivided as transmission during either the nonlactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating period (EL). Using data from 1000 farms, random forest algorithms were able to replicate the complex herd level diagnoses made by specialist veterinary clinicians with a high degree of accuracy. An accuracy of 98%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 86% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99% was achieved for the diagnosis of CONT vs ENV (with CONT as a “positive” diagnosis), and an accuracy of 78%, PPV of 76% and NPV of 81% for the diagnosis of EDP vs EL (with EDP as a “positive” diagnosis). An accurate, automated mastitis diagnosis tool has great potential to aid non-specialist veterinary clinicians to make a rapid herd level diagnosis and promptly implement appropriate control measures for an extremely damaging disease in terms of animal health, productivity, welfare and antimicrobial use."
"Depression is associated with peripheral inflammation, but its link with brain microglial activity remains unclear. In seven healthy males, we used repeated translocator protein-Positron Emission Tomography (TSPO-PET) dynamic scans with [11C]PBR28 to image brain microglial activation before and 24 h after the immune challenge interferon (IFN)-α. We also investigated the association between changes in peripheral inflammation, changes in microglial activity, and changes in mood. IFN-α administration decreased [11C]PBR28 PET tissue volume of distribution (Vt) across the brain (−20 ± 4%; t6 = 4.1, p = 0.01), but after correction for radioligand free-plasma fraction there were no longer any changes (+23 ± 31%; t = 0.1, p = 0.91). IFN-α increased serum IL-6 (1826 ± 513%, t6 = −7.5, p < 0.001), IL-7 (39 ± 12%, t6 = −3.6, p = 0.01), IL-10 (328 ± 48%, t6 = −12.8, p < 0.001), and IFN-γ (272 ± 64%, t6 = −7.0, p < 0.001) at 4–6 h, and increased serum TNF-α (49 ± 7.6%, t6 = −7.5, p < 0.001), IL-8 (39 ± 12%, t6 = −3.5, p = 0.013), and C-reactive protein (1320 ± 459%, t6 = −7.2, p < 0.001) at 24 h. IFN-α induced temporary mood changes and sickness symptoms after 4–6 h, measured as an increase in POMS-2 total mood score, confusion and fatigue, and a decrease in vigor and friendliness (all p ≤ 0.04). No association was found between changes in peripheral inflammation and changes in PET or mood measures. Our work suggests that brain TSPO-PET signal is highly dependent of inflammation-induced changes in ligand binding to plasma proteins. This limits its usefulness as a sensitive marker of neuroinflammation and consequently, data interpretation. Thus, our results can be interpreted as showing either that [11C]PBR28 is not sensitive enough under these conditions, or that there is simply no microglial activation in this model."
"Allergic asthma that is caused by inhalation of house dust mites (HDMs) is mainly mediated by Th2 cells. Recently, the roles of Sox (SRY-related high-mobility-group (HMG)-box) family members in various immune responses have been investigated. However, the roles of Sox12, a member of the SoxC group, in Th2 cell differentiation and allergic airway inflammation, remain unknown. We showed that Sox12 mRNA was significantly increased during Th2 cell differentiation. In vivo, HDM-induced eosinophil infiltration into the lung and Th2 cell differentiation were exacerbated in Sox12−/− mice compared with those in control Sox12+/− mice. In vitro, Sox12−/− CD4+ T cells that were cultured under Th2 conditions had increased production of Th2 cytokines and GATA3 protein compared with those of control Sox12+/− CD4+ T cells. Importantly, forced expression of Sox12 decreased the protein levels of GATA3 in CD4+ T cells under Th2 conditions without affecting mRNA expression. Furthermore, Sox12 induced degradation of GATA3 through the proteasome pathway in CD4+ T cells. Consistently, Sox12 enhanced ubiquitination of GATA3, which was mediated by the E3 ligase Fbw7. Finally, we found that Fbw7 knockdown partly abrogated Sox12-mediated GATA3 suppression in CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Sox12 suppresses Th2 cell differentiation by accelerating Fbw7-mediated GATA3 degradation, and attenuates HDM-induced allergic inflammation."
"Folate receptor α (FRα) came into focus as an anticancer target many decades after the successful development of drugs targeting intracellular folate metabolism, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed. Binding to FRα is one of several methods by which folate is taken up by cells; however, this receptor is an attractive anticancer drug target owing to the overexpression of FRα in a range of solid tumours, including ovarian, lung and breast cancers. Furthermore, using FRα to better localize effective anticancer therapies to their target tumours using platforms such as antibody–drug conjugates, small-molecule drug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates and, more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells could further improve the outcomes of patients with FRα-overexpressing cancers. FRα can also be harnessed for predictive biomarker research. Moreover, imaging FRα radiologically or in real time during surgery can lead to improved functional imaging and surgical outcomes, respectively. In this Review, we describe the current status of research into FRα in cancer, including data from several late-phase clinical trials involving FRα-targeted therapies, and the use of new technologies to develop FRα-targeted agents with improved therapeutic indices."
"BackgroundAlthough 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) have been shown to benefit men with prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS), their long-term safety remains controversial. Our objective is to describe the long-term association of 5ARI use with PCa progression in men on AS.Materials/subjects and methodsThe cohort of men with low-risk PCa was derived from a prospectively maintained AS database at the Princess Margaret (1995–2016). Pathologic, grade, and volume progression were the primary end points. Kaplan–Meier time-to-event analysis was performed and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of progression where 5ARI exposure was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. Patients who came off AS prior to any progression events were censored at that time.ResultsThe cohort included 288 men with median follow-up of 82 months (interquartile range: 37–120 months). Among non-5ARI users (n = 203); 114 men (56.2%) experienced pathologic progression compared with 24 men (28.2%) in the 5ARI group (n = 85), (p < 0.001). Grade and volume progression were higher in the non-5ARI group compared with the 5ARI group (n = 82; 40.4% vs. n = 19; 22.4% respectively, p = 0.003 for grade progression; n = 87; 43.1% and n = 15; 17.7%, respectively for volume progression p < 0.001). Lack of 5ARI use was independently positively associated with pathologic progression (HR: 2.65; CI: 1.65–4.24), grade progression (HR: 2.75; CI: 1.49–5.06), and volume progression (HR: 3.15; CI: 1.78–5.56). The frequency of progression to high-grade (Grade Group 4–5) tumors was not significantly different between the groups.ConclusionsUse of 5ARIs diminished both grade and volume progression without an increased risk of developing Grade Groups 4–5 disease."
"The DNA damage response after kidney injury induces cell cycle arrest in renal tubular epithelial cells, resulting in the secretion of pro-fibrotic cytokines, thereby promoting interstitial fibrosis in a paracrine manner. Phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is the initial step in the DNA damage response and subsequent cell cycle arrest; however, the effects of ATM inhibition on the injured kidney have not been explored. Pharmacological ATM inhibition by KU55933 in cisplatin-treated mice did not ameliorate, but instead exacerbated cisplatin-induced DNA damage and tubular injury, thereby increasing mortality. Analysis of isolated tubular epithelia by FACS from bigenic SLC34a1-CreERt2; R26tdTomato proximal tubular-specific reporter mice revealed that KU55933 upregulated p53 and subsequent pro-apoptotic signaling in tubular epithelia of cisplatin-treated mice, leading to marked mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. In addition, KU55933 attenuated several DNA repair processes after cisplatin treatment, including single-strand DNA repair and Fanconi anemia pathways, suggesting that DNA repair after dual treatment of cisplatin and KU55933 was not sufficient to prevent the cisplatin-induced tubular injury. Our study suggested that ATM inhibition does not increase DNA repair after cisplatin-induced DNA damage and exacerbates tubular injury through the upregulation of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling. Acute kidney injury must be carefully monitored when ATM inhibitors become available in clinical practice in the future."
"BackgroundAkt signalling regulates glycolysis and drives the Warburg effect in cancer, thus decreased glucose utilisation is a pharmacodynamic marker of Akt inhibition. However, cancer cells can utilise alternative nutrients to glucose for energy such as lactate, which is often elevated in tumours together with increased acidity. We therefore hypothesised that lactic acidosis may confer resistance to Akt inhibition.MethodsThe effect of the pan-Akt inhibitor uprosertib (GSK2141795), on HCT116 and LS174T colon cancer cells was evaluated in the presence and absence of lactic acid in vitro. Expression of downstream Akt signalling proteins was determined using a phosphokinase array and immunoblotting. Metabolism was assessed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, stable isotope labelling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.ResultsLactic acid-induced resistance to uprosertib was characterised by increased cell survival and reduced apoptosis. Uprosertib treatment reduced Akt signalling and glucose uptake irrespective of lactic acid supplementation. However, incorporation of lactate carbon and enhanced respiration was maintained in the presence of uprosertib and lactic acid. Inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative phosphorylation was sufficient to potentiate apoptosis in the presence of uprosertib.ConclusionsLactic acidosis confers resistance to uprosertib, which can be reversed by inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative metabolism."
"Assessing the viability of a blastosyst is still empirical and non-reproducible nowadays. We developed an algorithm based on artificial vision and machine learning (and other classifiers) that predicts pregnancy using the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) test from both the morphology of an embryo and the age of the patients. We employed two high-quality databases with known pregnancy outcomes (n = 221). We created a system consisting of different classifiers that is feed with novel morphometric features extracted from the digital micrographs, along with other non-morphometric data to predict pregnancy. It was evaluated using five different classifiers: probabilistic bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep neural network, decision tree, and Random Forest (RF), using a k-fold cross validation to assess the model’s generalization capabilities. In the database A, the SVM classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.74, and AUC of 0.77. In the database B the RF classifier obtained a F1 score of 0.71, and AUC of 0.75. Our results suggest that the system is able to predict a positive pregnancy test from a single digital image, offering a novel approach with the advantages of using a small database, being highly adaptable to different laboratory settings, and easy integration into clinical practice."
"Whole body lean mass (WBLM) is a heritable trait predicting sarcopenia. To identify genomic locus underlying WBLM, we performed a genome-wide association study of fat-adjusted WBLM in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, N = 6,004), and replicated in the Kansas City Osteoporosis Study (KCOS, N = 2,207). We identified a novel locus 3p27.1 that was associated with WBLM (lead SNP rs3732593 P = 7.19 × 10−8) in the discovery FHS sample, and the lead SNP was successfully replicated in the KCOS sample (one-sided P = 0.04). Bioinformatics analysis found that this SNP and its adjacent SNPs had the function of regulating enhancer activity in skeletal muscle myoblasts cells, further confirming the regulation of WBLM by this locus. Our finding provides new insight into the genetics of WBLM and enhance our understanding of sarcopenia."
"Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, two metabolic diseases strongly intertwined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Animal studies have demonstrated a potential causal role of gut microbiota in NAFLD. Human studies have started to describe microbiota alterations in NAFLD and have found a few consistent microbiome signatures discriminating healthy individuals from those with NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. However, patients with NAFLD often present with obesity and/or insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and these metabolic confounding factors for dysbiosis have not always been considered. Patients with different NAFLD severity stages often present with heterogeneous lesions and variable demographic characteristics (including age, sex and ethnicity), which are known to affect the gut microbiome and have been overlooked in most studies. Finally, multiple gut microbiome sequencing tools and NAFLD diagnostic methods have been used across studies that could account for discrepant microbiome signatures. This Review provides a broad insight into microbiome signatures for human NAFLD and explores issues with disentangling these signatures from underlying metabolic disorders. More advanced metagenomics and multi-omics studies using system biology approaches are needed to improve microbiome biomarkers."
"The cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ produced by tumor-reactive T cells is a key effector molecule with pleiotropic effects during anti-tumor immune responses. Although IFN-γ production is targeted at the immunologic synapse, its spatiotemporal activity within the tumor remains elusive. In the present study, we report that, although IFN-γ secretion requires local antigen recognition, IFN-γ diffuses extensively to alter the tumor microenvironment in distant areas. Using intravital imaging and a reporter for STAT1 translocation, we provide evidence that T cells mediate sustained IFN-γ signaling in remote tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor phenotypic alterations required several hours of exposure to IFN-γ, a feature that disfavored local IFN-γ activity over diffusion and bystander activity. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing data from melanoma patients also suggested bystander IFN-γ activity in human tumors. Thus, tumor-reactive T cells act collectively to create large cytokine fields that profoundly modify the tumor microenvironment."
"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) could represent clonal evolution where subclones with greater fitness confer more malignant phenotypes and invasion constitutes an evolutionary bottleneck. Alternatively, ITH could represent branching evolution with invasion of multiple subclones. The two models respectively predict a hierarchy of subclones arranged by phenotype, or multiple subclones with shared phenotypes. We delineate these modes of invasion by merging ancestral, topographic, and phenotypic information from 12 human colorectal tumors (11 carcinomas, 1 adenoma) obtained through saturation microdissection of 325 small tumor regions. The majority of subclones (29/46, 60%) share superficial and invasive phenotypes. Of 11 carcinomas, 9 show evidence of multiclonal invasion, and invasive and metastatic subclones arise early along the ancestral trees. Early multiclonal invasion in the majority of these tumors indicates the expansion of co-evolving subclones with similar malignant potential in absence of late bottlenecks and suggests that barriers to invasion are minimal during colorectal cancer growth."
"Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful marker for diagnosis of hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) and serial BNP measurement is also valuable for monitoring treatment response. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate whether plasma BNP level can predict treatment response to ibuprofen in preterm infants born at <30 weeks of gestation with hsPDA. Plasma BNP was measured before (baseline) and 12 to 24 h after (post-treatment) completion of the first (IBU1) and second (IBU2) course of ibuprofen. We compared the BNP levels of responders (closed or insignificant PDA) with those of non-responders (hsPDA requiring further pharmacologic or surgical closure) to each course of ibuprofen. The treatment response rates for IBU1 (n = 92) and IBU2 (n = 19) were 74% and 26%, respectively. In IBU1, non-responders had lower gestational age and birth weight than responders (both, P = 0.004), while in IBU2, non-responders had lower birth weight (P = 0.014) and platelet counts (P = 0.005) than responders; however, baseline BNP levels did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders in either IBU1 (median 1,434 vs. 1,750 pg/mL) or IBU2 (415 vs. 596 pg/mL). Post-treatment BNP was a useful marker for monitoring treatment efficacy of IBU1 and IBU2 for hsPDA with a cut-off value of 331 pg/mL (P < 0.001) and 423 pg/mL(P < 0.010), respectively. We did not identify a cut-off baseline BNP level that could predict treatment response to ibuprofen in preterm infants with hsPDA."
"The safety and efficacy of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) in children undergoing aortic arch surgery are unclear. In this retrospective analysis, we compared moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA; n = 61) plus SACP vs deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA; n = 53) in children undergoing aortic arch surgery during a period from January 2008 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics and the underlying anomalies were comparable between the two groups. The MHCA + SACP group had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (146.9 ± 40.6 vs 189.6 ± 41.2 min for DHCA; p < 0.05) and higher nasopharyngeal temperature (26.0 ± 2.1 vs 18.9 ± 1.6 °C; p < 0.01). The MHCA + SACP group had lower rate of neurologic complications (3/61 vs 10/53 for DHCA; p < 0.05) but not complications in other organ systems. The MHCA + SACP group also had less 24-hour chest drainage (median, interquartile rage: 28.9, 12.6–150.0 vs 47.4, 15.2–145.0 ml/kg for DHCA; p < 0.05), shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation (35.0, 15.4–80.3 vs 94.0, 42.0–144.0 h; p < 0.01), and shorter stay in intensive care unit (3.9, 3.0–7.0 vs 7.7, 5.0–15.0 d; p < 0.05). In regression analysis, in-hospital mortality was associated with longer CPB time. In conclusion, MHCA + SACP is associated with better short-term outcomes in children receiving aortic arch surgery under CPB."
"African and African-American (AA) women have higher incidence of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) with high histological grade and aggressive clinical behavior, but the reasons are not fully understood. We recently found that the oncogenic protein EZH2 is overexpressed in Ghanaian breast cancer patients, with 16% of the tumors expressing cytoplasmic EZH2. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of these aggressive tumors may lead to the identification of potential targetable oncogenic drivers. We characterized the copy number variations of 11 Ghanaian breast tumor patients by targeted multiplexed PCR-based DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) over 130 cancer-relevant genes. While the DNA quality was not optimal for mutation analysis, 90% of the tumors had frequent recurrent copy number alterations (CNAs) of 17 genes: SDHC, RECQL4, TFE3, BCL11A, BCL2L1, PDGFRA, DEK, SMUG1, AKT3, SMARCA4, VHL, KLF6, CCNE1, G6PD, FGF3, ABL1, and CCND1, with the top oncogenic functions being mitotic G1–G1/S-phase regulation, gene transcription, apoptosis, and PI3K/AKT pathway. The most common recurrent high-level CNAs were gains of RECQL4 and SDHC, in 50% and 60% of cases, respectively. Network analyses revealed a significant predicted interaction among 12 of the 17 (70.6%) genes with high-level CNAs (p = 5.7E−07), which was highly correlated with EZH2 expression (r = 0.4–0.75). By immunohistochemistry, RECQL4 and SDHC proteins were upregulated in 53 of 86 (61.6%) and 48 of 86 (56%) of Ghanaian invasive carcinoma tissue samples. In conclusion, our data show that invasive carcinomas from Ghana exhibit recurrent CNAs in 17 genes, with functions in oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/AKT and G1–G1/S regulation, which may have implications for the biology and treatment of invasive carcinomas in African and AA women."
"Previously, intragenic CAMTA1 copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to cause non-progressive, congenital ataxia with or without intellectual disability (OMIM#614756). However, ataxia, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features were all incompletely penetrant, even within families. Here, we describe four patients with de novo nonsense, frameshift or missense CAMTA1 variants. All four patients predominantly manifested features of ataxia and/or spasticity. Borderline intellectual disability and dysmorphic features were both present in one patient only, and other neurological and behavioural symptoms were variably present. Neurodevelopmental delay was found to be mild. Our findings indicate that also nonsense, frameshift and missense variants in CAMTA1 can cause a spastic ataxia syndrome as the main phenotype."
"Kidney size and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often increase with the onset of diabetes, and elevated GFR is a risk factor for the development of diabetic kidney disease. Hyperfiltration mainly occurs in response to signals passed from the tubule to the glomerulus: high levels of glucose in the glomerular filtrate drive increased reabsorption of glucose and sodium by the sodium–glucose cotransporters SGLT2 and SGLT1 in the proximal tubule. Passive reabsorption of chloride and water also increases. The overall capacity for proximal reabsorption is augmented by growth of the proximal tubule, which (alongside sodium–glucose cotransport) further limits urinary glucose loss. Hyperreabsorption of sodium and chloride induces tubuloglomerular feedback from the macula densa to increase GFR. In addition, sodium–glucose cotransport by SGLT1 on macula densa cells triggers the production of nitric oxide, which also contributes to glomerular hyperfiltration. Although hyperfiltration restores sodium and chloride excretion it imposes added physical stress on the filtration barrier and increases the oxygen demand to drive reabsorption. Tubular growth is associated with the development of a senescence-like molecular signature that sets the stage for inflammation and fibrosis. SGLT2 inhibitors attenuate the proximal reabsorption of sodium and glucose, normalize tubuloglomerular feedback signals and mitigate hyperfiltration. This tubule-centred model of diabetic kidney physiology predicts the salutary effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on hard renal outcomes, as shown in large-scale clinical trials."
"Drug delivery to the skin is highly constrained by the stratum corneum barrier layer1. Here, we developed star-shaped particles, termed STAR particles, to dramatically increase skin permeability. STAR particles are millimeter-scale particles made of aluminum oxide or stainless steel with micron-scale projections designed to create microscopic pores across the stratum corneum. After gentle topical application for 10 s to porcine skin ex vivo, delivery of dermatological drugs and macromolecules, including those that cannot be given topically, was increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. In mice treated with topical 5-fluorouracil, use of STAR particles increased the efficacy of the drug in suppressing the growth of subcutaneous melanoma tumors and prolonging survival. Moreover, topical delivery of tetanus toxoid vaccine to mice using STAR particles generated immune responses that were at least as strong as delivery of the vaccine by intramuscular injection, albeit at a higher dose for topical than intramuscular vaccine administration. STAR particles were well tolerated and effective at creating micropores when applied to the skin of human participants. Use of STAR particles provides a simple, low-cost and well-tolerated method for increasing drug and vaccine delivery to the skin and could widen the range of compounds that can be topically administered."
"This study sought to evaluate the association of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within NFKB and inflammasome pathway genes with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and response to TNF inhibitors (TNFi). We conducted a case-control study in a European population of 1194 RA patients and 1328 healthy controls. The association of potentially interesting markers was validated with data from the DANBIO (695 RA patients and 978 healthy controls) and DREAM (882 RA patients) registries. The meta-analysis of our data with those from the DANBIO registry confirmed that anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive subjects carrying the NFKB2rs11574851T allele had a significantly increased risk of developing RA (PMeta_ACPA + = 0.0006) whereas no significant effect was found in ACPA-negative individuals (PMeta_ACPA− = 0.35). An ACPA-stratified haplotype analysis including both cohorts (n = 4210) confirmed that ACPA-positive subjects carrying the NFKB2TT haplotype had an increased risk of RA (OR = 1.39, P = 0.0042) whereas no effect was found in ACPA-negative subjects (OR = 1.04, P = 0.82). The meta-analysis of our data with those from the DANBIO and DREAM registries also revealed a suggestive association of the NFKB2rs1056890 SNP with larger changes in DAS28 (OR = 1.18, P = 0.007). Functional experiments showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from carriers of the NFKB2rs1005044C allele (in LD with the rs1056890, r2 = 1.00) showed increased production of IL10 after stimulation with LPS (P = 0.0026). These results provide first evidence of a role of the NFKB2 locus in modulating the risk of RA in an ACPA-dependent manner and suggest its implication in determining the response to TNFi. Additional studies are now warranted to further validate these findings."
"Network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks. This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics."
"The mechanism by which humans absorb therapeutic light in winter seasonal and nonseasonal depression is unknown. Bright-light-induced release and generation of blood-borne gasotransmitters such as carbon monoxide (CO) may be one mechanism. Here, 24 healthy female volunteers had peripheral blood samples drawn. Samples were collected in a dimly lit room and protected from light exposure. Samples were analyzed for CO concentrations by gas chromatography after 2 h of continuous exposure to darkness vs. bright white light. In a similar confirmatory study, 11 additional volunteers had samples analyzed for CO concentrations after 2 h of continuous exposure to gentle rocking in darkness vs. in bright white light. In the first study, light-unexposed peripheral blood had a mean CO concentration of 1.8 ± 0.4 SD ppm/g. Identically treated samples with 2 h of rocking and exposure to bright white light at illuminance 10,000 lux had a mean CO of 3.6 ± 1.2 ppm/g (p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis of that study showed that time of day was significantly inversely associated with increase in CO concentration under bright light vs. dark (p < 0.04). In a smaller confirmatory study of 11 healthy female volunteers, after 2 h of rocking, light-unexposed peripheral blood had a mean CO of 1.4 ± 0.5 SD ppm/g. Identically treated blood samples with 2 h of exposure to bright white light at illuminance 10,000 lux had a mean CO of 2.8 ± 1.7 ppm/g (p < 0.02). In conclusion, bright-light exposure robustly increases human blood CO in vitro. This supports the putative role of CO as a physiological regulator of circadian rhythms and light’s antidepressant effects. This human evidence replicates earlier data from a preclinical in vivo model. This effect may be stronger in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitor administration reduces uric acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and also lowers blood pressure (BP). However, the associations of plasma XOR activity, uric acid level, and oxidative stress levels with BP remain unclear. This cross-sectional study included 156 subjects (68 males, 88 females) registered in the MedCity21 health examination registry without anti-hypertensive or anti-hyperuricemic agent administration. Plasma XOR activity was measured using our highly sensitive novel assay, which is unaffected by uric acid in the sample. BP was also determined, and serum uric acid and derivative of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) levels were simultaneously measured. Median plasma XOR activity, serum uric acid, d-ROMs, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) values were 25.7 pmol/h/mL, 5.4 mg/dL, 305 Carr U, and 89.0 mmHg, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that plasma XOR activity (β = 0.211, p = 0.019), but not serum uric acid (β = 0.072, p = 0.502), was significantly associated with MAP. In subjects with lower but not higher d-ROMs level, an independent association of plasma XOR activity with MAP was observed (β = 0.428, p = 0.001 and β = 0.019, p = 0.891, respectively; p for interaction = 0.046). XOR may contribute to the pathophysiology of higher BP through ROS but not uric acid production, especially in patients with lower oxidative stress."
"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligation delimits immunogenic responses in T cells. However, the consequences of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) ligation in T cells are uncertain. We found that T cell expression of PD-L1 in cancer was regulated by tumor antigen and sterile inflammatory cues. PD-L1+ T cells exerted tumor-promoting tolerance via three distinct mechanisms: (1) binding of PD-L1 induced STAT3-dependent ‘back-signaling’ in CD4+ T cells, which prevented activation, reduced TH1-polarization and directed TH17-differentiation. PD-L1 signaling also induced an anergic T-bet−IFN-γ− phenotype in CD8+ T cells and was equally suppressive compared to PD-1 signaling; (2) PD-L1+ T cells restrained effector T cells via the canonical PD-L1–PD-1 axis and were sufficient to accelerate tumorigenesis, even in the absence of endogenous PD-L1; (3) PD-L1+ T cells engaged PD-1+ macrophages, inducing an alternative M2-like program, which had crippling effects on adaptive antitumor immunity. Collectively, we demonstrate that PD-L1+ T cells have diverse tolerogenic effects on tumor immunity."
"BackgroundMetastatic high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (G3NENs) have limited treatment options after progression on platinum-based therapy. We addressed the role of Pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated metastatic G3NENs.MethodsTwo open-label, phase 2 studies enrolled patients with G3NEN (Ki-67 > 20%) to receive Pembrolizumab at 200 mg I.V. every 3 weeks. Radiographic evaluation was conducted every 9 weeks with overall response rate as the primary endpoint.ResultsBetween November 2016 and May 2018, 29 patients (13 males/16 females) with G3NENs were enrolled. One patient (3.4%) had an objective response and an additional six patients (20.7%) had stable disease, resulting in a disease control rate of 24.1%. Disease control rate (DCR) at 18 weeks was 10.3% (3/29). There was no difference in the DCR, PFS or OS between the PD-L1-negative and -positive groups (p 0.56, 0.88 and 0.55, respectively). Pembrolizumab was well tolerated with only 9 grade 3, and no grade 4 events considered drug-related.ConclusionsPembrolizumab can be safely administered to patients with G3NENs but has limited activity as a single agent. Successful completion of our trials suggest studies in G3NENs are feasible and present an unmet need. Further research to identify active combination therapies should be considered.Clinical trial registration numberNCT02939651 (10/20/2016)."
"ObjectivesTo determine the proportion of well-appearing newborns screened for hypoglycemia, yield of specific screening criteria, and impact of screening on breastfeeding.Study designThe retrospective study of well-appearing at-risk infants born ≥36 weeks’ gestation with blood glucose (BG) measurements obtained ≤72 h of age.ResultsOf 10,533 eligible well newborns, 48.7% were screened for hypoglycemia. Among tested infants, BG < 50 mg/dL occurred in 43% and 4.6% required intensive care for hypoglycemia. BG < 50 mg/dL was associated with lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding (22% vs 65%, p < 0.001). Infants screened due to late-preterm birth were most frequently identified as hypoglycemic. The fewest abnormal values occurred among appropriate weight, late-term infants of nondiabetic mothers.ConclusionHypoglycemia risk criteria result in screening a large proportion of otherwise well newborns and negatively impact rates of exclusive breastfeeding. The risks and benefits of hypoglycemia screening recommendations should be urgently addressed."
"Antibiotic resistance has become a major concern for human and animal health. As fluoroquinolones have been extensively used in human and veterinary medicine, there has also been the rapid emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance around the world. Here, we analysed the microbiome of goat milk using samples from healthy goats and those diagnosed with persistent mastitis and treated using the antibiotic enrofloxacin with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We selected a group of 11 goats and 22 samples of milk that did not respond clinically to enrofloxacin treatment. Milk samples were evaluated before and after treatment to verify changes of the microbiota; the three first lactating goats were selected from the healthy control group. The milk samples from the healthy control animals presented a larger abundance of different species of bacteria of the Staphylococcus genus, but a smaller number of different genera, which indicated a more specific niche of resident bacteria. The Firmicutes phylum was predominantly different between the studied groups. Samples from before-treatment animals had a higher number of new species than those from the control group, and after being treated again. These microbiota received new bacteria, increasing the differences in bacteria even more in relation to the control group. Genotypes such as Trueperella and Mannheimia, between other genera, had a high abundance in the samples from animals with persistent mastitis. The dysbiosis in this study, with marked evidence of a complex microbiota in activity in cases of the failure of antimicrobial treatment for persistent chronic mastitis, demonstrates a need to improve the accuracy of pathogen identification and increases concern regarding antibiotic treatments in milk production herds."
"The study aimed to compare the tumor response to and complications of doxorubicin-eluting CalliSphere bead-transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) using small- and medium-sized beads in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent multiple rounds of oncology therapies. Sixty patients with intermediate stage HCC who had previously received multiple oncology therapies underwent DEB-TACE with CalliSpheres of 100–300 μm (small bead group, n = 34) or 300–500 μm (medium bead group, n = 26) in diameter between October 2016 and December 2018. Adverse events and the response rate of the index tumor based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors at 3 months post-TACE were compared between the groups. The rates of complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were 35.4%, 29.4%, 17.6%, and 17.6%, respectively, for the small bead group and 33.1%, 23.1%, 20.8%, and 23.0%, respectively, for the medium bead group, showing no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 8 patients in the small bead group and in no patients in the medium bead group, showing a significant group difference (P < 0.01). Major complications included 8 events of ischemic hepatitis, 2 of biloma, and 2 of severe liver abscess. DEB-TACE using CalliSpheres of 300–500 μm was associated with a comparable rate of tumor response but lower rate of complications compared with that using CalliSpheres of 100–300 μm for HCC treatment in patients who had already undergone multiple rounds of oncology therapies."
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate risk factors of Clostridium Difficile infection (CDI) after spinal surgery using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) data. The incidence of postoperative CDI was investigated using HIRA data from 2012 to 2016. Cases involving CDI that occurred within a 30-day postoperative period were identified. Risk factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, postoperative infection, spinal surgery procedure, type of antibiotic, and duration of antibiotic use, were evaluated. Duration of hospital stay, medical cost, and mortality were also evaluated. In total, 71,322 patients were included. Presumed cases of CDI were identified in 57 patients, with CDI rate of 0.54 per 10,000 patient days. Advanced age, staged operation, postoperative infection, and the use of multiple antibiotics were significant risk factors. First-generation cephalosporins were shown to be associated with a lower incidence of CDI. CDI was also associated with longer hospital stays and increased medical cost, and it was an independent risk factor for increased mortality. Extra attention should be paid to patients at high risk for the development of postoperative CDI, and unnecessary use of multiple antibiotics should be avoided. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective cohort study"
"ObjectiveOur objective was to incorporate social and built environment factors into a compendium of multilevel factors among a cohort of very low birth weight infants to understand their contributions to inequities in NICU quality of care and support providers and NICUs in addressing these inequities via development of a health equity dashboard.Study designWe examined bivariate associations between NICU patient pool and NICU catchment area characteristics and NICU quality of care with data from a cohort of 15,901 infants from 119 NICUs in California, born 2008–2011.ResultNICUs with higher proportion of minority racial/ethnic patients and lower SES patients had lower quality scores. NICUs with catchment areas of lower SES, higher composition of minority residents, and more household crowding had lower quality scores.ConclusionMultilevel social factors impact quality of care in the NICU. Their incorporation into a health equity dashboard can inform providers of their patients’ potential resource needs."
"Lower corrected calcium (cCa) levels are associated with a better prognosis among incident dialysis patients. However, cCa frequently overestimates ionized calcium (iCa) levels. The prognostic importance of the true calcium status defined by iCa remains to be revealed. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of incident hemodialysis patients. We collected data of iCa levels immediately before the first dialysis. We divided patients into three categories: apparent hypocalcemia (low iCa; <1.15 mmol/L and low cCa; <8.4 mg/dL), hidden hypocalcemia (low iCa despite normal or high cCa), and normocalcemia (normal iCa). The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death and cardiovascular diseases after hospital discharge. Among the enrolled 332 patients, 75% of the patients showed true hypocalcemia, defined as iCa <1.15 mmol/L, 61% of whom showed hidden hypocalcemia. In multivariate Cox models including other potential risk factors, true hypocalcemia was a significant risk factor (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–5.34), whereas hypocalcemia defined as corrected calcium <8.4 mg/dL was not. Furthermore, hidden hypocalcemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of the outcome compared with normocalcemia (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.11–5.94), while apparent hypocalcemia was not. Patients with hidden hypocalcemia were less likely to receive interventions to correct hypocalcemia, such as increased doses of active vitamin D or administration of calcium carbonate, than patients with apparent hypocalcemia (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.89). Hidden hypocalcemia was a strong predictor of death and cardiovascular events, suggesting the importance of measuring iCa."
"Melinjo seed extract (MSE) contains large amounts of polyphenols, including dimers of trans-resveratrol (e.g. gnetin C, L, gnemonoside A, B and D), and has been shown to potentially improve obesity. However, there is no clinical evidence regarding the anti-obesity effects of MSE, and its mechanisms are also unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that MSE supplementation increases the adiponectin (APN) multimerization via the up-regulation of disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) under either or both physiological and obese conditions. To investigate the effect of MSE on the physiological condition, 42 healthy young volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial for 14 days. The participants were randomly assigned to the MSE 150 mg/day, MSE 300 mg/day or placebo groups. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effect of MSE on APN levels under obese conditions, we administered MSE powder (500 or 1000 mg/kg/day) to control-diet- or high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice for 4 weeks. All participants completed the clinical trial. The administration of MSE 300 mg/day was associated with an increase in the ratio of HMW/total APN in relation to the genes regulating APN multimerization, including DsbA-L. Furthermore, this effect of MSE was more pronounced in carriers of the DsbA-L rs191776 G/T or T/T genotype than in others. In addition, the administration of MSE to HFD mice suppressed their metabolic abnormalities (i.e. weight gain, increased blood glucose level and fat mass accumulation) and increased the levels of total and HMW APN in serum and the mRNA levels of ADIPOQ and DsbA-L in adipose tissue. The present study suggests that MSE may exert beneficial effects via APN multimerization in relation to the induction of DsbA-L under both physiological and obese conditions."
"Oncolytic virotherapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic option for solid tumours. Several oncolytic vectors in clinical testing are based on attenuated viruses; thus, efforts are being taken to develop a new repertoire of oncolytic viruses, based on virulent viral genomes. This possibility, however, raises concerns dealing with the safety features of the virulent phenotypes. We generated a double regulated Herpes simplex type-1 virus (HSV-1), in which tumour cell restricted replicative potential was combined to selective entry via ERBB2 receptor retargeting. The transcriptional control of the viral alpha4 gene encoding for the infected cell protein-4 (ICP4) by the cellular Survivin/BIRC5 promoter conferred a tumour cell-restricted replicative potential to a virulent HSV-1 genome. The combination of the additional ERBB2 retargeting further improved the selectivity for tumour cells, conferring to the double regulated virus a very limited ability to infect and propagate in non-cancerous cells. Accordingly, a suitable replicative and cytotoxic potential was maintained in tumour cell lines, allowing the double regulated virus to synergize in vivo with immune checkpoint (anti-PD-1) blockade in immunocompetent mice. Thus, restricting the replicative spectrum and tropism of virulent HSV-1 genomes by combination of conditional replication and retargeting provides an improved safety, does not alter the oncolytic strength, and is exploitable for its therapeutic potential with immune checkpoint blockade in cancer."
"Autoimmune diseases are chronic, multifactorial conditions. Through machine learning (ML), a branch of the wider field of artificial intelligence, it is possible to extract patterns within patient data, and exploit these patterns to predict patient outcomes for improved clinical management. Here, we surveyed the use of ML methods to address clinical problems in autoimmune disease. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases. Relevant papers included “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” and the autoimmune diseases search term(s) in their title, abstract or key words. Exclusion criteria: studies not written in English, no real human patient data included, publication prior to 2001, studies that were not peer reviewed, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers. 169 (of 702) studies met the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models. Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios (e.g. classification of cases and controls). Progression to more complex predictive models may be achievable in future through integration of multiple data types."
"Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) suffer from motor and non-motor symptoms; 40% would develop dementia (PD-D). Impaired face and emotion processing in PD has been reported; however, the deficits of face processing in PD-D remain unclear. We investigated three essential aspects of face processing capacity in PD-D, and the associations between cognitive, neuropsychiatric assessments and task performances. Twenty-four PD-D patients (mean age: 74.0 ± 5.55) and eighteen age-matched healthy controls (HC) (mean age: 71.0 ± 6.20) received three computerized tasks, morphing-face discrimination, dynamic facial emotion recognition, and expression imitation. Compared to HC, PD-D patients had lower sensitivity (d’) and greater neural internal noises in discriminating faces; responded slower and had difficulties with negative emotions; imitated some expressions but with lower strength. Correlation analyses revealed that patients with advancing age, slow mentation, and poor cognition (but not motor symptoms) showed stronger deterioration in face perception. Importantly, these correlations were absent in the age-matched HC. The present study is among the first few examined face processing in patients with PD-D, and found consistent deficits correlated with advancing age and slow mentation. We propose that face discrimination task could be included as a potential test for the early detection of dementia in PD."
"Great interest exists in maximizing exposure therapy efficacy in anxiety disorders. At the same time, reduced frequency and shortened duration of exposure sessions are required to meet the specific regularities in routine care settings. Extinction has emerged as the key mechanism of exposure treatment in anxiety disorders. Examining exposure treatment processes from the perspective of extinction learning might provide novel insights into variability in exposure treatment duration and outcome. The present study sought to examine the functional link between fear extinction, the ability to accomplish exposure in a predetermined time and exposure therapy outcome in specific phobia. Treatment-seeking individuals (N = 53) with spider phobia underwent a context-dependent fear conditioning paradigm prior to a standardized exposure. Spider-phobic participants who were able to complete exposure within the pre-determined time (i.e., completers) showed a more pronounced short- and long-term exposure therapy benefit. In the fear conditioning task, a more pronounced decline in CS-US contingency ratings during extinction (retrieval) was found in completers relative to non-completers. The failure to further extinguish US expectancy to the CSs in non-completers might offer a potential mechanistic explanation why non-completers have difficulties to accomplish all exposure steps in a fixed time and show less pronounced treatment gains. Our findings bear specific implications for the implementation of exposure treatment to routine care settings."
"Therapeutic approaches to combat type 1 diabetes (T1D) include donor pancreas transplantation, exogenous insulin administration and immunosuppressive therapies. However, these clinical applications are limited due to insufficient tissue compatible donors, side effects of exogenous insulin administration and/or increased onset of opportunistic infections attributable to induced global immunosuppression. An alternative approach to alleviate disease states is to utilize insulin-producing pancreatic islets seeded in a bioscaffold for implantation into diabetic recipients. The present studies now report that a newly developed cationic polymer biomaterial serves as an efficient bioscaffold for delivery of donor syngeneic pancreatic islet cells to reverse hyperglycemia in murine streptozotocin induced- or non-obese diabetic mouse models of T1D. Intraperitoneal implantation of pancreatic islets seeded within the copolymer bioscaffold supports long-term cell viability, response to extracellular signaling cues and ability to produce soluble factors into the microenvironment. Elevated insulin levels were measured in recipient diabetic mice upon implantation of the islet-seeded biomaterial coupled with reduced blood glucose levels, collectively resulting in increased survival and stabilization of metabolic indices. Importantly, the implanted islet-seeded biomaterial assembled into a solid organoid substructure that reorganized the extracellular matrix compartment and recruited endothelial progenitors for neovascularization. This allowed survival of the graft long-term in vivo and access to the blood for monitoring glucose levels. These results highlight the novelty, simplicity and effectiveness of this biomaterial for tissue regeneration and in vivo restoration of organ functions."
"The phase 3 A.R.R.O.W. study demonstrated that treatment with once-weekly carfilzomib (70 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (once-weekly Kd70 mg/m2) improved progression-free survival compared with twice-weekly carfilzomib (27 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (twice-weekly Kd27 mg/m2) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM; median, 11.2 versus 7.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.88; P = 0.0029). Once-weekly dosing also improved response rates and depth of response. We performed a subgroup analysis from A.R.R.O.W. according to age (<65, 65–74, or ≥75 years), renal function (creatinine clearance <50, ≥50–<80, or ≥80 mL/min), number of prior therapies (2 or 3), and bortezomib-refractory status (yes or no). Compared with twice-weekly Kd27 mg/m2, once-weekly Kd70 mg/m2 reduced the risk of progression or death (HR = 0.60–0.85) and increased overall response rates in nearly all the examined subgroups, consistent with reports in the overall A.R.R.O.W. population. The safety profiles of once-weekly Kd70 mg/m2 across subgroups were also generally consistent with those in the overall population. Findings from this subgroup analysis generally demonstrate a favorable benefit–risk profile of once-weekly Kd70 mg/m2, further supporting once-weekly carfilzomib dosing as an appropriate treatment option for patients with RRMM, regardless of baseline patient and disease characteristics."
"Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is considered a simple and feasible indicator of insulin resistance (IR). This study aims to delve into the association and interaction of TyG index on the risk of prehypertension in Chinese adults. A community based cross-sectional survey conducted in Chinese population. Eligible participants were recruited, and questionnaire survey, anthropometric tests, and blood samples collection were performed. TyG index was obtained as ln [fasting TG(mg/dl) × FPG(mg/dl)/2]. Logistic regression model and the area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) were analyzed. Interaction analysis was conducted by calculating relative excess risk for interaction (RERI), attributable proportion for interaction (AP) as well as synergy index (SI). A total of 3115 recruited participants (1307 males and 1808 females) were aged 60.82 years on average. The prevalence of prehypertension reached 36.4% on the whole, 37.6% in male and 35.5% in female, respectively. The results of multivariable logistic regression model suggested that the adjusted OR for prehypertension was upregulated across TyG index quartiles, up to 2.06 (95% CI:1.53–2.77) for quartiles 4 versus quartiles 1. Furthermore, TyG index outperformed FPG (Z = 2.15, p = 0.032) and TG (Z = 6.10, p < 0.001) in discriminating prehypertension risk. Besides, TyG index with abdominal obesity (RERI:1.53, 95% CI:0.39–2.67; AP: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16–0.59; SI:1.96, 95% CI:1.15–3.34) displayed a noticeable interaction on risk of prehypertension. Our study indicated that a higher TyG index rose the risk of prehypertension independently and synergistically with abdominal obesity in Chinese adults. Furthermore, it exhibited a higher predictability compared with conventional indices."
"The specific GluN2B antagonist rislenemdaz (Ris; a.k.a. MK-0657 and CERC-301) is in phase II clinical trial as an antidepressive drug, but the working mechanism for its antidepressant effects is not clearly understood. Given the important role of the lateral habenula (LHb) in the pathogenesis of depression and the fact that GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are expressed in the LHb, we conducted a study to examine whether the LHb mediates Ris’ antidepressant effects in a chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced depressive-like mouse model. In this study, Ris was administered systemically or locally into the LHb. Short hairpin RNAs were used to knockdown BDNF in the LHb. Depressive-like behaviors were assessed with the open field test, forced swimming test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. Expression of GluN2B, BDNF, and c-Fos in the LHb were analyzed with western blotting and immunohistochemistry under condition with Ris administered systemically or with BDNF knockdown in the LHb. We found that both systemic and intra-LHb administration of Ris alleviated CRS-induced despair-like behavior and that systemic Ris reduced LHb expression of GluN2B, BDNF, and c-Fos (a neuronal activity marker). Specific knockdown of BDNF in the LHb prevented CRS-induced despair-like behavior, while preventing CRS-induced increases in BDNF and c-Fos expression in the LHb. Together these results suggest that Ris may exert its antidepressant effects through affecting the LHb such as downregulating BDNF expression in the LHb."
"The molecular mechanisms underlying caudal-to-rostral progression of Lewy body pathology in Parkinson’s disease remain poorly understood. Here, we identified transcriptomic signatures across brain regions involved in Braak Lewy body stages in non-neurological adults from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Among the genes that are indicative of regional vulnerability, we found known genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease: SCARB2, ELOVL7, SH3GL2, SNCA, BAP1, and ZNF184. Results were confirmed in two datasets of non-neurological subjects, while in two datasets of Parkinson’s disease patients we found altered expression patterns. Co-expression analysis across vulnerable regions identified a module enriched for genes associated with dopamine synthesis and microglia, and another module related to the immune system, blood-oxygen transport, and endothelial cells. Both were highly expressed in regions involved in the preclinical stages of the disease. Finally, alterations in genes underlying these region-specific functions may contribute to the selective regional vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease brains."
"Recent studies have highlighted the value of microRNA-21 (miR-21) as a prognostic biomarker in gliomas. However, the role of miR-21 in predicting prognosis remains controversial. We performed a comprehensive study based upon a meta-analysis and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioma dataset validation to clarify the prognostic significance of miR-21 in glioma patients. In this study, we searched Embase, PubMed, Web of science, CNKI, SinoMed, and Wanfang databases for records up to May 2018. Relevant data were extracted to assess the correlation between miR-21 expression and survival in glioma patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe association strength. We further used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess miR-21 expression in the TCGA glioma dataset to validate the relationship between miR-21 expression and survival. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Among them, eight studies provided data on overall survival (OS) with a pooled HR of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.73), indicating that higher expression of miR-21 was significantly associated with worse OS in glioma patients; for the other study, which provided data on progression-free survival (PFS), no statistically significant HR was reported for PFS in the glioma patients (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.41, 3.72). A multivariate Cox regression analysis of the miR-21 expression in the TCGA glioma dataset revealed that overexpression of miR-21 was a potential independent prognostic biomarker of poorer OS (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.59) and poorer PFS (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.82). Our findings suggest that higher expression of miR-21 is correlated with poorer glioma prognosis."
"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) transplantation has been used to treat Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) based on the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs. However, the effectiveness need improving and its underlying intrinsic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Id3 is upregulated in bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMMSCs) isolated from NOD/ShiLtJ mice, a widely used SS model, compared with ICR mice as control, suggesting that it functions in SS development and therapy. Transplantation of Id3-deficient BMMSCs rescues salivary gland function more effective than wild-type BMMSCs in NOD/ShiLtJ mice. Mechanistically, we show that ID3 negatively regulated BMP4 expression by preventing binding of basic helix–loop–helix protein E2A to the promoter of the Bmp4 gene. BMP4 in turn promoted PGE2 production in MSCs, and exhibited enhanced suppressive activities of T-cell proliferation and Th1 differentiation. Importantly, BMMSCs from SS patients showed significantly lower BMP4 and PGE2 expression than those from healthy individuals. Taken together, our findings revealed the targeting Id3 may be therapeutically useful for improving MSC immunoregulation and effectiveness of MSCs therapy for SS."
"Environmental radioactive contamination caused by the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident has aroused great concern regarding a possible increase in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer. The ultrasound examinations were conducted immediately after the accident as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS), which is divided into the preliminary baseline survey (PBLS) and the full-scale survey (FSS). Some of their outcomes are reported regularly and made available to the public. We have detailed measurements of the air-dose rates and radioactive elements in soil in many places all over the Fukushima prefecture. To study the dose-response relationship, we begin with the assumption that the external and internal doses are correlated with the air-dose rate and the amount of 131I in soil, respectively. We then investigate the relationship between these estimated doses and the PBLS and FSS thyroid cancer cases. Our analysis shows that the dose-response curve with the FSS data clearly differs from that with the PBLS data. Finally, we consider the potential mitigating effects of evacuation from highly contaminated areas in both external and internal exposure scenarios."
"Antigenic drift of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) is enabled by facile evolvability. However, HA antigenic site B, which has become immunodominant in recent human H3N2 influenza viruses, is also evolutionarily constrained by its involvement in receptor binding. Here, we employ deep mutational scanning to probe the local fitness landscape of HA antigenic site B in six different human H3N2 strains spanning from 1968 to 2016. We observe that the fitness landscape of HA antigenic site B can be very different between strains. Sequence variants that exhibit high fitness in one strain can be deleterious in another, indicating that the evolutionary constraints of antigenic site B have changed over time. Structural analysis suggests that the local fitness landscape of antigenic site B can be reshaped by natural mutations via modulation of the receptor-binding mode. Overall, these findings elucidate how influenza virus continues to explore new antigenic space despite strong functional constraints."
"The possibility to use β− decaying isotopes for radioguided surgery (RGS) has been recently proposed, and first promising tests on ex-vivo samples of Meningioma and intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) have been published. This paper reports a study of the uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC in pancreatic NETs (pNETs) in order to assess the feasibility of a new RGS approach using 90Y-DOTATOC. Tumor and healthy pancreas uptakes were estimated from 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans of 30 patients with pNETs. From the obtained SUVs (Standardised Uptake Value) and TNRs (Tumor Non tumor Ratio), an analysis algorithm relying on a Monte Carlo simulation of the detector has been applied to evaluate the performances of the proposed technique. Almost all considered patients resulted to be compatible with the application of β−-RGS assuming to administer 1.5 MBq/kg of activity of 90Y-DOTATOC 24 h before surgery, and a sampling time of few seconds. In just 2 cases the technique would have required a mildly increased amount of activity or of sampling time. Despite a high physiological uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC in the healthy pancreas, the proposed RGS technique promises to be effective. This approach allows RGS to find application also in pancreatic diseases, where traditional techniques are not viable."
"The cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, signaling via the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), orchestrate type 2 immunity to helminth infections and toxins. Activation of epithelial and myeloid cells, and a transient neutrophils influx initiates type 2 immune responses, which are dominated by basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, B cell immunoglobulin E production, and type 2 T helper and T follicular helper cells. Interestingly, IL-4 and IL-13 can curtail chemotaxis and several effector functions of neutrophils in mice and humans. This inhibitory role of IL-4 and IL-13 probably developed to limit tissue damage by neutrophils during type 2 immunity where a “weep and sweep” response aims at expulsion and decreased fecundity, instead of killing, of macroparasites. Here, we review when IL-4R signaling cytokines appeared during evolution relative to neutrophils and adaptive immunity. Neutrophil-like granular phagocytes were present in invertebrates throughout the bilaterian clade, but we were unable to find data on IL-4, IL-13, or their receptors in invertebrates. Conversely, vertebrates had both adaptive immunity and IL-4, IL-13, and IL-4Rs, suggesting that type 2 cytokines evolved together with adaptive immunity. Further studies are necessary to determine whether IL-4R signaling in neutrophils was established simultaneously with the appearance of adaptive immunity or later."
"Vascular bio-scaffolds produced from decellularized tissue offer a promising material for treatment of several types of cardiovascular diseases. These materials have the potential to maintain the functional properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and allow for growth and remodeling in vivo. The most commonly used methods for decellularization are based on chemicals and enzymes combinations, which often damage the ECM and cause cytotoxic effects in vivo. Mild methods involving pressurized CO2-ethanol (EtOH)-based fluids, in a supercritical or near supercritical state, have been studied for decellularization of cardiovascular tissue, but results are controversial. Moreover, data are lacking on the amount and type of lipids remaining in the tissue. Here we show that pressurized CO2-EtOH-H2O fluids (average molar composition, ΧCO2 0.91) yielded close to complete removal of lipids from porcine pulmonary arteries, including a notably decrease of pro-inflammatory fatty acids. Pressurized CO2-limonene fluids (ΧCO2 0.88) and neat supercritical CO2 (scCO2) achieved the removal of 90% of triacylglycerides. Moreover, treatment of tissue with pressurized CO2-limonene followed by enzyme treatment, resulted in efficient DNA removal. The structure of elastic fibers was preserved after pressurized treatment, regardless solvent composition. In conclusion, pressurized CO2-ethanol fluids offer an efficient tool for delipidation in bio-scaffold production, while pressurized CO2-limonene fluids facilitate subsequent enzymatic removal of DNA."
"We aimed to investigate the role of RORγt (Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma) in the tumor microenvironment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed 56 patients (48 papillary and 8 follicular thyroid carcinomas). Immunohistochemical expression of RORγt was compared to other immune markers previously investigated by our group, clinical and pathological information. All patients presented cytoplasmic expression of RORγt in thyroid tumor cells. Seven (12.5%) patients presented no nuclear expression of RORγt. Positivity was few (up to 10%) in 14 patients; 10 to 50% in 5 patients (8.9%); and more than 50% in 30 patients (53.6%). Nuclear RORγt positivity was associated with absence of distant metastasis at diagnosis (p = 0.013) and the need of less cumulative doses of radioactive iodine (p = 0.039). Patients whose tumors were positive for nuclear RORγt presented higher 10-years relapse-free survival rate than those patients who were negative for RORγt (p = 0.023). We classified the patients according to the clustering of immunological immunohistochemical markers. We were able to distinguish a subset (A) of 38 patients who presented high expression of nuclear RORγt and tended to be scarce in proinflammatory immune markers. Other 16 patients integrated a second subset (B) whose tumor microenvironment accumulated proinflammatory markers and presented low expression of nuclear nuclear RORγt. Distant metastasis at diagnosis were more frequent among patients from cluster B than from cluster A (p = 0.008). Our results reinforce that the expression of RORγt together with other immune markers might help predict the prognosis of patients with thyroid cancer and help individualize clinical management."
"A nitrobenzoxadiazole-based fluoroprobe (NBD-Bu) is designed to probe cellular metabolic activity in cancer and normal cells. NBD-Bu shows a significant fluorescence enhancement upon selective binding to the transport protein serum albumin in PBS buffer at ambient conditions. Encouraged by this finding, the site- specificity of NBD-Bu has been explored through a competitive displacement assay in the presence of site-specific markers such as warfarin and ibuprofen. Notably, even at micromolar concentrations, the probe possesses the ability to displace the site marker drug ibuprofen, efficiently. Subsequently, high-resolution fluorescence imaging results consolidated the potential of NBD-Bu for detection of abnormal cellular metabolic activity."
"Acute heart failure (AHF) is a syndrome defined as the new onset (de novo heart failure (HF)) or worsening (acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF)) of symptoms and signs of HF, mostly related to systemic congestion. In the presence of an underlying structural or functional cardiac dysfunction (whether chronic in ADHF or undiagnosed in de novo HF), one or more precipitating factors can induce AHF, although sometimes de novo HF can result directly from the onset of a new cardiac dysfunction, most frequently an acute coronary syndrome. Despite leading to similar clinical presentations, the underlying cardiac disease and precipitating factors may vary greatly and, therefore, the pathophysiology of AHF is highly heterogeneous. Left ventricular diastolic or systolic dysfunction results in increased preload and afterload, which in turn lead to pulmonary congestion. Fluid retention and redistribution result in systemic congestion, eventually causing organ dysfunction due to hypoperfusion. Current treatment of AHF is mostly symptomatic, centred on decongestive drugs, at best tailored according to the initial haemodynamic status with little regard to the underlying pathophysiological particularities. As a consequence, AHF is still associated with high mortality and hospital readmission rates. There is an unmet need for increased individualization of in-hospital management, including treatments targeting the causative factors, and continuation of treatment after hospital discharge to improve long-term outcomes."
"At advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) stages subchondral trabecular bone (STB) is altered. Lower limb alignment plays a role in OA progression and modify the macroscopic loading of the medial and lateral condyles of the tibial plateau. How the properties of the STB relate to alignment and OA stage is not well defined. OA stage (KL scores 2–4) and alignment (HKA from 17° Varus to 8° Valgus) of 30 patients were measured and their tibial plateau were collected after total knee arthroplasty. STB tissue elastic modulus, bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and trabecula thickness (Tb.Th) were evaluated with nanoindentation and µCT scans (8.1 µm voxel-size) of medial and lateral samples of each plateau. HKA and KL scores were statistically significantly associated with STB elastic modulus, BV/TV and Tb.Th. Medial to lateral BV/TV ratio correlated with HKA angle (R = −0.53, p = 0.016), revealing a higher ratio for varus than valgus subjects. STB properties showed lower values for KL stage 4 patients. Tissue elastic modulus ratios and BV.TV ratios were strongly correlated (R = 0.81, p < 0.001). Results showed that both micromechanical and microarchitectural properties of STB are affected by macroscopic loading at late stage knee OA. For the first time, a strong association between tissue stiffness and quantity of OA STB was demonstrated."
"Diagnostic methods for initial diagnosis and patient stratification for treatment are key to modern oncology, but many challenges remain. In developed countries, advances in early diagnosis and therapeutics have led to challenges in the sampling of sub-centimetre lesions, with repeat biopsies straining accuracy and throughput of pathological assessment. Conversely, low-income and middle-income countries face extremely limited pathology and imaging resources, large caseloads, convoluted and inefficient workflows, and a lack of specialists. Advances in material sciences, chemistry, engineering and artificial intelligence have led to the introduction of a new class of affordable image cytometers that enable automated cell phenotyping, with ongoing clinical testing indicating that these systems can alleviate existing bottlenecks and improve diagnostic efficiency. Ultimately, these diagnostic methods are likely to surpass current pathology approaches on the basis of the richness of molecular measurements and the fact that they require only scant cellular material, rather than tissue sections. As these methods can be miniaturized and are low-power, they can also be used in point-of-care settings. In this Review, we focus on new devices and approaches for the integrated analysis of scant cancer samples, particularly those obtained by fine-needle aspiration."
"Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most common renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, patients with KIRC usually have poor prognosis due to limited biomarkers for early detection and prognosis prediction. In this study, we analysed key genes and pathways involved in KIRC from an array dataset including 26 tumour and 26 adjacent normal tissue samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed with the WGCNA package, and 20 modules were characterized as having the highest correlation with KIRC. The upregulated genes in the tumour samples are involved in the innate immune response, whereas the downregulated genes contribute to the cellular catabolism of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Furthermore, the key genes were evaluated through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network combined with a co-expression network. The comparatively lower expression of AGXT, PTGER3 and SLC12A3 in tumours correlates with worse prognosis in KIRC patients, while higher expression of ALOX5 predicts reduced survival. Our integrated analysis illustrated the hub genes involved in KIRC tumorigenesis, shedding light on the development of prognostic markers. Further understanding of the function of the identified KIRC hub genes could provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms of KIRC."
"Accurate identification of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in patients with early-stage breast cancer is important for determining appropriate axillary treatment options and therefore avoiding unnecessary axillary surgery and complications. Here, we report deep learning radiomics (DLR) of conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography of breast cancer for predicting ALN status preoperatively in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical parameter combined DLR yields the best diagnostic performance in predicting ALN status between disease-free axilla and any axillary metastasis with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.902 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.843, 0.961) in the test cohort. This clinical parameter combined DLR can also discriminate between low and heavy metastatic burden of axillary disease with AUC of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.814, 0.996) in the test cohort. Our study offers a noninvasive imaging biomarker to predict the metastatic extent of ALN for patients with early-stage breast cancer."
"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy. Although the use of bortezomib (BTZ) significantly improves MM therapy, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to BTZ remains a major clinical problem. In this study, we find that Cdc37, a key co-chaperone of Hsp90, is downregulated in relapsed MM patients, especially after BTZ treatment, suggesting a link between Cdc37 and BTZ resistance. Suppression of Cdc37 or inhibition of Cdc37/Hsp90 association induces plasma cell dedifferentiation, quiescence of MM cells, and BTZ resistance in MM. Furthermore, we discover that Cdc37 expression correlates positively with Xbp1s, a critical transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation in MM samples. Depletion/inhibition of Cdc37 downregulates Xbp1s, while overexpression of Xbp1s in MM cell lines partially rescues plasma immaturation and BTZ resistance. It is suggested that Xbp1s may act as a key downstream effector of Cdc37. Experiments with a mouse model also demonstrate that Cdc37 inhibition promotes plasma cell immaturation, confers BTZ resistance, and increases MM progression in vivo. Together, we identify a critical factor and a new signaling mechanism that regulate plasma cell immaturation and BTZ resistance in MM cells. Our findings may constitute a novel strategy that overcomes BTZ resistance in MM therapy."
"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited monogenic disorders, characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function due in part to the formation of fluid-filled cysts. While there is one FDA-approved therapy, it is associated with potential adverse effects, and all other clinical interventions are largely supportive. Insights into the cellular pathways underlying ADPKD have revealed striking similarities to cancer. Moreover, several drugs originally developed for cancer have shown to ameliorate cyst formation and disease progression in animal models of ADPKD. These observations prompted us to develop a high-throughput screening platform of cancer drugs in a quest to repurpose them for ADPKD. We screened ~8,000 compounds, including compounds with oncological annotations, as well as FDA-approved drugs, and identified 155 that reduced the viability of Pkd1-null mouse kidney cells with minimal effects on wild-type cells. We found that 109 of these compounds also reduced in vitro cyst growth of Pkd1-null cells cultured in a 3D matrix. Moreover, the result of the cyst assay identified therapeutically relevant compounds, including agents that interfere with tubulin dynamics and reduced cyst growth without affecting cell viability. Because it is known that several ADPKD therapies with promising outcomes in animal models failed to be translated to human disease, our platform also incorporated the evaluation of compounds in a panel of primary ADPKD and normal human kidney (NHK) epithelial cells. Although we observed differences in compound response amongst ADPKD and NHK cell preparation, we identified 18 compounds that preferentially affected the viability of most ADPKD cells with minimal effects on NHK cells. Our study identifies attractive candidates for future efficacy studies in advanced pre-clinical models of ADPKD."
"Non-invasive caries treatment is a major focus in modern dentistry. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of monomeric self-assembling peptide P11-4 (SAP P11-4) in combination with fluoride varnish or polymeric self-assembling peptide matrix (SAPM) in treatment of non-cavitated occlusal caries. Ninety children and adolescents were included in this randomized, gold-standard-controlled clinical trial. Test Group 1 received SAP P11-4 and twice fluoride varnish at baseline and Day 180, Test Group 2 received SAP P11-4 on baseline and twice weekly SAPM (home-application), and Control Group received fluoride varnish on baseline and Day 180. Caries progression was measured by laser fluorescence, Nyvad Caries Activity, ICDAS-II-codes, and investigator assessments. Laser fluorescence changes demonstrated superior results for Test Group 1 and 2, as values decreased compared to an increase for the Control Group (p < 0.0005). ICDAS-II codes at Day 360 showed partial regression for Test Group 1 (6.7%) and Test Group 2 (20.0%) and partial progression for Control Group (23.3%) (p < 0.01). Nyvad Caries Activity yielded superior caries inactivation for Test Groups, compared to Control Group (p = 0.002). This trial showed that SAP P11-4, applied either in combination with fluoride varnish or twice weekly SAPM, was a superior treatment for early caries compared to fluoride varnish alone."
"Interoceptive signals concerning the internal physiological state of the body influence motivational feelings and action decisions. Cardiovascular arousal may facilitate inhibition to mitigate risks of impulsive actions. Baroreceptor discharge at ventricular systole underpins afferent signalling of cardiovascular arousal. In a modified Go/NoGo task, decisions to make or withhold actions on ‘Choose’ trials were not influenced by cardiac phase, nor individual differences in heart rate variability. However, cardiac interoceptive awareness and insight predicted how frequently participants chose to act, and their speed of action: Participants with better awareness and insight tended to withhold actions and respond slower, while those with poorer awareness and insight tended to execute actions and respond faster. Moreover, self-reported trait urgency correlated negatively with intentional inhibition rates. These findings suggest that lower insight into bodily signals is linked to urges to move the body, putatively by engendering noisier sensory input into motor decision processes eliciting reactive behaviour."
"Known risk variants explain only a small proportion of breast cancer heritability, particularly in Asian women. To search for additional genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer, here we perform a meta-analysis of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in Asians (24,206 cases and 24,775 controls) and European descendants (122,977 cases and 105,974 controls). We identified 31 potential novel loci with the lead variant showing an association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 × 10−8. The associations for 10 of these loci were replicated in an independent sample of 16,787 cases and 16,680 controls of Asian women (P < 0.05). In addition, we replicated the associations for 78 of the 166 known risk variants at P < 0.05 in Asians. These findings improve our understanding of breast cancer genetics and etiology and extend previous findings from studies of European descendants to Asian women."
"Selected patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) can benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after onset. Identifying patients who might benefit from late intervention after transfer from community hospitals to thrombectomy-capable centers would be valuable. We searched for presentation biomarkers to identify such patients. Frequent MR imaging over 2 days of 38 untreated LVO patients revealed logarithmic growth of the ischemic infarct core. In 24 patients with terminal internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions we found that an infarct core growth rate (IGR) <4.1 ml/hr and initial infarct core volumes (ICV) <19.9 ml had accuracies >89% for identifying patients who would still have a core of <50 ml 24 hours after stroke onset, a core size that should predict favorable outcomes with thrombectomy. Published reports indicate that up to half of all LVO stroke patients have an IGR <4.1 ml/hr. Other potentially useful biomarkers include the NIHSS and the perfusion measurements MTT and Tmax. We conclude that many LVO patients have a stroke physiology that is favorable for late intervention, and that there are biomarkers that can accurately identify them at early time points as suitable for transfer for intervention."
"Disseminated disease is present in ≈50% of colorectal cancer patients upon diagnosis, being responsible for most of cancer deaths. Addition of biological drugs, as Bevacizumab, to chemotherapy, has increased progression free survival and overall survival of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. However, these benefits have been only reported in a small proportion of patients. To date, there are not biomarkers that could explain the heterogeneity of this disease and would help in treatment selection. Recent findings demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in cancer and they can be encapsulated with high stability into extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released in biological fluids. EVs can act as cell-to-cell communicators, transferring genetic information, such as miRNAs. In this context, we aimed to investigate serum EV associated miRNAs (EV-miRNAs) as novel non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Bevacizumab-treated mCRC patients. We observed that baseline miRNA-21 and 92a outperformed carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the diagnosis of our 44 mCRC patients, compared to 17 healthy volunteers. In addition, patients who died presented higher levels of miRNA-92a and 222 at 24 weeks. However, in the multivariate Cox analysis, higher levels of miRNA-222 at 24 weeks were associated with lower overall survival. Altogether, these data indicate that EV-miRNAs have a strong potential as liquid biopsy biomarkers for the identification and prognosis of mCRC."
"22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the strongest known molecular risk factor for schizophrenia. Brain responses to auditory stimuli have been studied extensively in schizophrenia and described as potential biomarkers of vulnerability to psychosis. We sought to understand whether these responses might aid in differentiating individuals with 22q11.2DS as a function of psychotic symptoms, and ultimately serve as signals of risk for schizophrenia. A duration oddball paradigm and high-density electrophysiology were used to test auditory processing in 26 individuals with 22q11.2DS (13–35 years old, 17 females) with varying degrees of psychotic symptomatology and in 26 age- and sex-matched neurotypical controls (NT). Presentation rate varied across three levels, to examine the effect of increasing demands on memory and the integrity of sensory adaptation. We tested whether N1 and mismatch negativity (MMN), typically reduced in schizophrenia, related to clinical/cognitive measures, and how they were affected by presentation rate. N1 adaptation effects interacted with psychotic symptomatology: Compared to an NT group, individuals with 22q11.2DS but no psychotic symptomatology presented larger adaptation effects, whereas those with psychotic symptomatology presented smaller effects. In contrast, individuals with 22q11.2DS showed increased effects of presentation rate on MMN amplitude, regardless of the presence of symptoms. While IQ and working memory were lower in the 22q11.2DS group, these measures did not correlate with the electrophysiological data. These findings suggest the presence of two distinct mechanisms: One intrinsic to 22q11.2DS resulting in increased N1 and MMN responses; another related to psychosis leading to a decreased N1 response."
"Exposure to chloromethylisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (CMIT/MIT) has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis and occupational asthma. Despite this association however, no study has investigated the effects of CMIT/MIT exposure on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). This study was conducted to investigate the influence of epicutaneous exposure to CMIT/MIT on AD in a mouse model and the underlying biological mechanisms. BALB/C mice were exposed to CMIT/MIT for 3 weeks and AD was developed using ovalbumin (OVA) epidermal sensitization. CMIT/MIT epicutaneous exposure in normal mice significantly enhanced AD-like phenotypes (e.g., transepidermal water loss, clinical score, total serum immunoglobulin E level and infiltration of inflammatory cells). In addition, CMIT/MIT exposure significantly augmented the mRNA expression level of T helper (Th) 2-related cytokines (thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-13), Th2 chemokine (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17) and the population of CD4+IL-4+ cells in the skin. Moreover, mice exposed to CMIT/MIT in the OVA challenge had greater AD-like phenotypes, higher IL-4 and IL-17A skin mRNA expression levels, and a larger population of CD4+IL-4+- and IL-17A+-producing cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes. Our current findings in a mouse model thus suggest that CMIT/MIT exposure may cause AD symptoms through the dysregulation of Th2/Th17-related immune responses."
"Repeated alcohol exposure leads to changes in gene expression that are thought to underlie the transition from moderate to excessive drinking. However, the mechanisms by which these changes are integrated into a maladaptive response that leads to alcohol dependence are not well understood. One mechanism could involve the recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators that bind and modulate the activity of transcription factors. Our results indicate that the transcriptional regulator LMO4 is one such candidate regulator. Lmo4-deficient mice (Lmo4gt/+) consumed significantly more and showed enhanced preference for alcohol in a 24 h intermittent access drinking procedure. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Lmo4 in the nucleus accumbens enhanced alcohol consumption, whereas knockdown in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) decreased alcohol consumption and reduced conditioned place preference for alcohol. To ascertain the molecular mechanisms that underlie these contrasting phenotypes, we carried out unbiased transcriptome profiling of these two brain regions in wild type and Lmo4gt/+ mice. Our results revealed that the transcriptional targets of LMO4 are vastly different between the two brain regions, which may explain the divergent phenotypes observed upon Lmo4 knockdown. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Oprk1 and genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important transcriptional targets of LMO4 in the BLA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that LMO4 bound Oprk1 promoter elements. Consistent with these results, disruption of the ECM or infusion of norbinaltorphimine, a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, in the BLA reduced alcohol consumption. Hence our results indicate that an LMO4-regulated transcriptional network regulates alcohol consumption in the BLA."
"Skeletal muscle represents the largest pool of body zinc, however, little is known about muscle zinc homeostasis or muscle-specific zinc functions. Zip14 (Slc39a14) was the most highly expressed zinc transporter in skeletal muscle of mice in response to LPS-induced inflammation. We compared metabolic parameters of skeletal muscle from global Zip14 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice (WT). At basal steady state Zip14 KO mice exhibited a phenotype that included muscle wasting and metabolic endotoxemia. Microarray and qPCR analysis of gastrocnemius muscle RNA revealed that ablation of Zip14 produced increased muscle p-Mef2c, Hspb7 and miR-675-5p expression and increased p38 activation. ChIP assays showed enhanced binding of NF-\(\kappa \beta \) to the Mef2c promoter. In contrast, LPS-induced systemic inflammation enhanced Zip14-dependent zinc uptake by muscle, increased expression of Atrogin1 and MuRF1 and markedly reduced MyoD. These signatures of muscle atrophy and cachexia were not influenced by Zip14 ablation, however. LPS-induced miR-675-3p and -5p expression was Zip14-dependent. Collectively, these results with an integrative model are consistent with a Zip14 function in skeletal muscle at steady state that supports myogenesis through suppression of metabolic endotoxemia and that Zip14 ablation coincides with sustained activity of phosphorylated components of signaling pathways including p-Mef2c, which causes Hspb7-dependent muscle wasting."
"Hydrocephalus is a common disorder caused by the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Treatment typically involves the surgical implantation of a pressure-regulated silicone tube assembly, known as a shunt. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates and diagnosing shunt malfunction is challenging due to a combination of vague symptoms and a lack of a convenient means to monitor flow. Here, we introduce a wireless, wearable device that enables precise measurements of CSF flow, continuously or intermittently, in hospitals, laboratories or even in home settings. The technology exploits measurements of thermal transport through near-surface layers of skin to assess flow, with a soft, flexible, and skin-conformal device that can be constructed using commercially available components. Systematic benchtop studies and numerical simulations highlight all of the key considerations. Measurements on 7 patients establish high levels of functionality, with data that reveal time dependent changes in flow associated with positional and inertial effects on the body. Taken together, the results suggest a significant advance in monitoring capabilities for patients with shunted hydrocephalus, with potential for practical use across a range of settings and circumstances, and additional utility for research purposes in studies of CSF hydrodynamics."
"BackgroundMetabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis in cancer supports unrestricted cell proliferation, survival and chemoresistance. The molecular bases of these processes are still undefined. Recent reports suggest crucial roles for microRNAs. Here, we provide new evidence of the implication of miR-27a in modulating colorectal cancer (CRC) metabolism and chemoresistance.MethodsA survey of miR-27a expression profile in TCGA-COAD dataset revealed that miR-27a-overexpressing CRCs are enriched in gene signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulated oxidative phosphorylation, mTOR activation and reduced chemosensitivity. The same pathways were analysed in cell lines in which we modified miR-27a levels. The response to chemotherapy was investigated in an independent cohort and cell lines.ResultsmiR-27a upregulation in vitro associated with impaired oxidative phosphorylation, overall mitochondrial activities and slight influence on glycolysis. miR-27a hampered AMPK, enhanced mTOR signalling and acted in concert with oncogenes and tumour cell metabolic regulators to force an aerobic glycolytic metabolism supporting biomass production, unrestricted growth and chemoresistance. This latter association was confirmed in our cohort of patients and cell lines.ConclusionsWe disclose an unprecedented role for miR-27a as a master regulator of cancer metabolism reprogramming that impinges on CRC response to chemotherapy, underscoring its theragnostic properties."
"Although the introduction of immunotherapy has improved outcomes for follicular lymphoma (FL) patients, histological transformation (HT) and early relapse still confer a poor prognosis. We sought to describe the patterns of change in treatment, response, and outcome of FL patients at our institution over the last four decades. Seven hundred and twenty-seven patients (389 F/338 M; median age, 57 years) consecutively diagnosed with grade 1-3a FL between 1980 and 2017, categorized into four decades according to the time of diagnosis, constituted the study population. Clinical characteristics, treatment, response, absolute and relative survival, HT, second malignancies (SM), and causes of death were assessed. Median OS for the entire cohort was 17.6 years. From decade 1 to 4, there was an increase in the complete response rate (48 to 70%), progression-free survival (40 to 56% at 5 years), OS (77 to 86% at 5 years), and relative survival ratio (0.83 to 0.94 at 5 years), with no significant differences in the risk of HT or SM. Lymphoma remained the most common cause of death in all four decades. These findings illustrate the overall improvement in outcome for FL patients, but support the need for further research into risk stratification and management."
"Changing predator-prey interactions during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution (MMR) profoundly altered the trajectory of marine tetrapod evolution. Here, we assess potential signatures of this landmark transition through the fossil record of skeletal pathologies in ichthyosaurs — iconic marine reptiles that developed increasingly ‘fish-like’ body plans over time. We surveyed a stratigraphically constrained sample of 200 Middle Triassic ichthyosaur specimens and compared the type, distribution and prevalence of pathologies with an approximately equivalent assemblage of Early Jurassic age. Overall, skeletal pathologies were equally prevalent in these groups, and most often manifested in species >4 m long. However, pathological bones were found to be concentrated in the hind limbs and tail of Triassic ichthyosaurs, whereas the jaws, forelimbs, and ribcage were preferentially affected in Jurassic taxa. We posit that the occurrence of ankylosed zygapophyses in the caudal peak of Triassic ichthyosaurs could represent a functional by-product of their primitive ‘eel-like’ swimming. Conversely, increased instances of broken ribs in Jurassic ichthyosaurs may infer ramming or tail strike behaviours that characterise morphologically ‘fish-like’ marine tetrapods, such as modern toothed whales. Different categories of skeletal pathologies thus evidently reflect structural modifications in the ichthyosaur body plan, and indirectly coincide with ecological turnover during the MMR."
"This single-center retrospective study aims to investigate the clinical features of esophageal foreign bodies (EFBs) and determine the influence of EFB shapes on management and prognosis. A total of 427 patients aged 13 to 95 years with suspected EFB ingestion were enrolled between January 2013 and June 2018, 183 of whom were male. EFBs were divided into six shapes: pin (n = 161), sheet (n = 97), trident (n = 51), spindle (n = 66), irregular (n = 46), and sphere (n = 6). Spindle-shaped EFBs correlated with a significantly higher rate of perforation and severe complications (P < 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) than any other EFB shape, while sheet-shaped EFBs were linked to less severe complications (P = 0.006). The number of pressure points was provided to stratify the risk of poor prognosis for each shape. EFBs with only two pressure points (pin and spindle EFBs) required more advanced management strategies and were correlated with a higher number of patients suffering esophageal perforation (27.11%) and severe complications (12.44%) when compared with other shapes (χ2 = 11.149 and P = 0.001; χ2 = 5.901 and P = 0.015, respectively). Spindle shape was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, and contributed a more clinical risk than the pin shape. In conclusion, clinical features, management, perforation rate, and severe complications differed based on EFB shape. The EFBs with two pressure points, especially the spindle-shaped EFBs, were more dangerous compared with those with more pressure points."
"Tumor metastasis is a hallmark of cancer. Metastatic cancer cells often reside in distal tissues and organs in their dormant state. Mechanisms underlying the pre-metastatic niche formation are poorly understood. Here we show that in a colorectal cancer (CRC) model, primary tumors release integrin beta-like 1 (ITGBL1)-rich extracellular vesicles (EVs) to the circulation to activate resident fibroblasts in remote organs. The activated fibroblasts induce the pre-metastatic niche formation and promote metastatic cancer growth by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Mechanistically, the primary CRC-derived ITGBL1-enriched EVs stimulate the TNFAIP3-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway to activate fibroblasts. Consequently, the activated fibroblasts produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote metastatic cancer growth. These findings uncover a tumor–stromal interaction in the metastatic tumor microenvironment and an intimate signaling communication between primary tumors and metastases through the ITGBL1-loaded EVs. Targeting the EVs-ITGBL1-CAFs-TNFAIP3-NF-κB signaling axis provides an attractive approach for treating metastatic diseases."
"The incidence of lymphoma has gradually increased over previous decades, and it ranks among the ten most prevalent cancers worldwide. With the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, though a subset of lymphoma patients has become curable, the treatment of refractory and relapsed diseases remains challenging. Many efforts have been made to explore new targets and to develop corresponding therapies. In addition to novel antibodies targeting surface antigens and small molecular inhibitors targeting oncogenic signaling pathways and tumor suppressors, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells have been rapidly developed to target the tumor microenvironment. Although these targeted agents have shown great success in treating lymphoma patients, adverse events should be noted. The selection of the most suitable candidates, optimal dosage, and effective combinations warrant further investigation. In this review, we systematically outlined the advances in targeted therapy for malignant lymphoma, providing a clinical rationale for mechanism-based lymphoma treatment in the era of precision medicine."
"Epidemiological studies link long term exposure to xenoestrogen Bisphenol-A to adverse cardiovascular effects. Our previous results show that BPA induces hypertension by a mechanism involving CamKII activation and increased redox stress caused by eNOS uncoupling. Recently, CamKII sustained activation has been recognized as a central mediator of programmed cell death in cardiovascular diseases, including necroptosis. However, the role of necroptosis in cardiac response to BPA had not yet been explored. Mice exposed to BPA for 16 weeks showed altered heart function, electrical conduction, and increased blood pressure. Besides, a stress test showed ST-segment depression, indicative of cardiac ischemia. The hearts exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and reduced vascularization, interstitial edema, and large hemorrhagic foci accompanied by fibrinogen deposits. BPA initiated a cardiac inflammatory response, up-regulation of M1 macrophage polarization, and increased oxidative stress, coinciding with the increased expression of CamKII and the necroptotic effector RIP3. In addition, cell death was especially evident in coronary endothelial cells within hemorrhagic areas, and Evans blue extravasation indicated a vascular leak in response to Bisphenol-A. Consistent with the in vivo findings, BPA increased the necroptosis/apoptosis ratio, the expression of RIP3, and CamKII activation in endothelial cells. Necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, alleviated BPA induced cardiac dysfunction and prevented the inflammatory and hemorrhagic response in mice. Mechanistically, silencing of RIP3 reversed BPA-induced necroptosis and CamKII activation in endothelial cells, while inhibition of CamKII activation by KN-93 had no effect on RIP3 expression but decreased necroptotic cell death suggesting that BPA induced necroptosis is mediated by a RIP 3/CamKII dependent pathway. Our results reveal a novel pathogenic role of BPA on the coronary circulation. BPA induces endothelial cell necroptosis, promotes the weakening of coronary vascular wall, which caused internal ventricular hemorrhages, delaying the reparative process and ultimately leading to cardiac dysfunction."
"Immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have shown some success in cervical and vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, but little is known about the potential vulnerability of these tumors to other checkpoint inhibitors. TIM-3 is a checkpoint molecule that exerts immunosuppressive function via its interaction with Gal-9. TIM-3 and Gal-9 have been identified on a variety of malignancies but have not been studied in cervical and vulvar cancers, nor has their relationship to PD-L1 been established. Sixty-three cervical and vulvar invasive (n = 34) and intraepithelial lesions (n = 29) were assessed for TIM-3, Gal-9, and PD-L1 in tumor/lesional cells and associated immune cells. Tumoral TIM-3 expression was identified in 85% of squamous cell carcinomas but only 21% of intraepithelial lesions (p < 0.0001). When immune cells were also accounted for, 97% of invasive and 41% of intraepithelial lesions had a TIM-3 combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 1 (p < 0.0001). Tumoral membranous expression of Gal-9 was seen in 82% of squamous cell carcinomas and 31% of intraepithelial lesions (p = 0.0001); nearly all cases had Gal-9-positive immune cells. Tumoral PD-L1 was seen in 71% of squamous cell carcinomas and 10% of intraepithelial lesions (p < 0.0001), while the PD-L1 CPS was ≥1 in 82 and 21%, respectively (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in TIM-3, GAL-9, or PD-L1 expression in cervical vs. vulvar neoplasms, nor was HPV status significantly associated with any of the three markers. Dual TIM-3/Gal-9 expression was present in the majority (86%) of PD-L1-positive cases including 100% of PD-L1-positive squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a possible role for TIM-3 checkpoint inhibition in concert with anti-PD-1/PD-L1."
"The current study sought to examine the contribution of auditory and visual statistical learning on language and social competency abilities as well as whether decreased statistical learning abilities are related to increased autistic traits. To answer these questions, participants’ (N = 95) auditory and visual statistical learning abilities, language, social competency, and level of autistic traits were assessed. Although the relationships observed were relatively small in magnitude, our results demonstrated that visual statistical learning related to language and social competency abilities and that auditory learning was more related to autism symptomatology than visual statistical learning. Furthermore, the relationship between visual statistical learning and social competency was mediated by language comprehension abilities, suggesting that impairments in statistical learning may cascade into impairments in language and social abilities."
"Persistent shortage and heterogeneous quality of liver grafts encourages the optimization of donor-recipient matching in liver transplantation (LT). We explored whether or not there was a survival benefit (SB) of LT according to the quality of grafts assessed by the Donor Quality Index (DQI) and recipients’ disease severity, using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) in 8387 French patients wait-listed between 2009 and 2014. SB associated with LT was estimated using the sequential stratification method in different categories of MELD and DQI. For each transplantation, a stratum was created that matched one transplanted patient with all eligible control candidates. Strata were thereafter combined, and a stratified Cox model, adjusted for covariates, was fitted in order to estimate hazard ratios that qualified the SB according to each MELD and DQI sub-group. A significant SB was observed for all MELD and DQI sub-groups, with the exception of high MELD patients transplanted with “high-risk” grafts. More specifically, in decompensated-cirrhosis patients, “high-risk” grafts did not appear to be detrimental in medium MELD patients. Interestingly, in hepatocellular-carcinoma (HCC) patients, a significant SB was found for all MELD-DQI combinations. For MELD exceptions no SB was found. In terms of SB, “low-risk” grafts appeared appropriate for most severe patients (MELD > 30). Conversely, low/medium MELD and HCC patients presented an SB while allocated “high-risk” grafts. Thus, SB based matching rules for LT candidates might improve the survival of the LT population as a whole."
"Enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction residue (REAE) has a lower utilization rate as it is the “waste” produced after the enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE), but its nutritional value is high. To improve the development and utilization of REAE, in this study, cookies were made by adding REAE (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) as a food additive to a small amount of flour. The AOAC method was used to identify the basic components of REAE, analyze its physical and chemical properties, and characterize the cookie structure change in terms of texture, disulfide bond, and thiol content. An in vitro simulation system and sensory evaluation mechanism were established to analyze the bioavailability and impact of quality. The results show that REAE is a potential food additive. With an increase in the REAE content, the cookies become lighter in color, the sweetness and fat content are reduced, the hardness is increased, and the digestibility and glycerin index are reduced. The change in texture is caused by the reduction of disulfide bonds in the dough. The cookies were ‘well accepted’ with up to 30% REAE. Therefore, the use of the appropriate amount of REAE as a new food additive will reduce the amount of starch added."
"Respiratory tract infections require early diagnosis and adequate treatment. With the antibiotic overuse and increment in antibiotic resistance there is an increased need to accurately distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. We investigated the diagnostic performance of calprotectin in respiratory tract infections and compared it with the performance of heparin binding protein (HBP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Biomarkers were analyzed in patients with viral respiratory infections and patients with bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis (n = 135). Results were compared with values obtained from 144 healthy controls. All biomarkers were elevated in bacterial and viral infections compared to healthy controls. Calprotectin was significantly increased in patients with bacterial infections; bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis compared with viral infections. PCT was significantly elevated in patients with bacterial pneumonia compared to viral infections but not in streptococcal tonsillitis or mycoplasma caused infections. HBP was not able to distinguish between bacterial and viral causes of infections. The overall clinical performance of calprotectin in the distinction between bacterial and viral respiratory infections, including mycoplasma was greater than performance of PCT and HBP. Rapid determination of calprotectin may improve the management of respiratory tract infections and allow more precise diagnosis and selective use of antibiotics."
"The recombination activating gene (RAG or RAG1/RAG2 complex)-mediated adaptive immune system is a hallmark of jawed vertebrates. It has been reported that RAG originated in invertebrates. However, whether RAG further evolved once it arose in jawed vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here, we found that zebrafish RAG (zRAG) had a lower activity than mouse RAG (mRAG). Intriguingly, the attenuated stability of zebrafish RAG2 (zRAG2), but not zebrafish RAG1, caused the reduced V(D)J recombination efficiency compared to mRAG at 37 °C which are the body temperature of most endotherms except birds. Importantly, the lower temperature 28 °C, which is the best temperature for zebrafish growth, made the recombination efficiency of zRAG similar to that of mRAG by improving the stability of zRAG2. Consistent with the prementioned observation, the V(D)J recombination of Rag2KI/KI mice, which zRAG2 was substituted for mRAG2, was also severely impaired. Unexpectedly, Rag2KI/KI mice developed cachexia syndromes accompanied by premature death. Taken together, our findings illustrate that the evolution of zebrafish RAG2 protein is required for adapting to the elevated body temperature of the higher endothermic vertebrates."
"Background/objectivesTryptophan is an essential amino acid that must be obtained from dietary items, such as dairy products, eggs, nuts, legumes, and grains, which are rich in tryptophan. It has also been suggested as a dietary supplement to improve mental health. Observationally plasma tryptophan is inversely associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD), however, its main metabolites, serotonin, and kynurenine are positively associated with IHD, which makes the effects of tryptophan difficult to infer. This study aimed to obtain less-confounded estimates of the associations of tryptophan and physiologically related factors (serotonin and kynurenine) with IHD, its risk factors and depression.Subjects/methodsWe used a two-sample Mendelian Randomization study design. We used genetic instruments independently associated with tryptophan, serotonin, and kynurenine metabolites applied to a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank SOFT CAD study with the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (cases n ≤ 76,014 and controls n ≤ 264,785), and other consortia for risk factors including diabetes, lipids, and blood pressure, as well as for depression. We combined genetic variant-specific estimates using inverse variance weighting, with MR-Egger, the weighted median and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses.ResultsTryptophan and serotonin were not associated with IHD. Kynurenine was nominally and positively associated with IHD (odds ratio 1.57 per standard deviation, 95% confidence interval 1.05–2.33) but not after correction for multiple comparisons. Associations with IHD risk factors and depression were null.ConclusionsWe cannot exclude the possibility that one of the main metabolites of tryptophan, kynurenine, might be positively associated with IHD. Further studies are needed to confirm any association and underlying mechanism."
"Anti-angiogenic therapies have generated significant interest for their potential to combat tumor growth. However, tumor overproduction of pro-angiogenic ligands can overcome these therapies, hampering success of this approach. To circumvent this problem, we target the resynthesis of phosphoinositides consumed during intracellular transduction of pro-angiogenic signals in endothelial cells (EC), thus harnessing the tumor’s own production of excess stimulatory ligands to deplete adjacent ECs of the capacity to respond to these signals. Using zebrafish and human endothelial cells in vitro, we show ECs deficient in CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2 are uniquely sensitive to increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation due to a reduced capacity to re-synthesize phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in VEGF-exacerbated defects in angiogenesis and angiogenic signaling. Using murine tumor allograft models, we show that systemic or EC specific suppression of phosphoinositide recycling results in reduced tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. Our results suggest inhibition of phosphoinositide recycling provides a useful anti-angiogenic approach."
"Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes (T2D) recommend avoidance of hypoglycemia and less stringent glycemic control in older patients. We examined the relation of glycemic control to glucose-lowering medications use in a cohort of patients aged>80 years with a diagnosis of T2D and a hospital admission in the Capital Region of Denmark in 2012–2016. We extracted data on medication use, diagnoses, and biochemistry from the hospitals’ records. We identified 5,172 T2D patients with high degree of co-morbidity and where 17% had an HbA1c in the range recommended for frail, comorbid, older patients with type 2 diabetes (58–75 mmol/mol (7.5–9%)). Half of the patients (n = 2,575) had an HbA1c <48 mmol/mol (<6.5%), and a majority of these (36% of all patients) did not meet the diagnostic criteria for T2D. Of patients treated with one or more glucose-lowering medications (n = 1,758), 20% had HbA1c-values <42 mmol/mol (<6%), and 1% had critically low Hba1c values <30 mmol/mol (<4.9%), In conclusion, among these hospitalized T2D patients, few had an HbA1c within the generally recommended glycemic targets. One third of patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria for T2D, and of the patients who were treated with glucose-lowering medications, one-fifth had HbA1c-values suggesting overtreatment."
"Behaviour problems and anxieties in dogs decrease their quality of life and may lead to relinquishment or euthanasia. Considering the large number of pet dogs and the commonness of these problematic behaviours, a better understanding of the epidemiology and related molecular and environmental factors is needed. We have here studied the prevalence, comorbidity, and breed specificity of seven canine anxiety-like traits: noise sensitivity, fearfulness, fear of surfaces and heights, inattention/impulsivity, compulsion, separation related behaviour and aggression with an online behaviour questionnaire answered by dog owners. Our results show that noise sensitivity is the most common anxiety-related trait with a prevalence of 32% in 13,700 Finnish pet dogs. Due to the high prevalence of noise sensitivity and fear, they were the most common comorbidities. However, when comparing the relative risk, the largest risk ratios were seen between hyperactivity/inattention, separation related behaviour and compulsion, and between fear and aggression. Furthermore, dog breeds showed large differences in prevalence of all anxiety-related traits, suggesting a strong genetic contribution. As a result, selective breeding focusing on behaviour may reduce the prevalence of canine anxieties. Anxious animals may suffer from chronic stress and thus, modified breeding policies could improve the welfare of our companion dogs."
"The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is the initial recipient of odour information from the olfactory bulb, and the target of dense innervation conveying spatiotemporal cues from the hippocampus. We hypothesized that the AON detects the coincidence of these inputs, generating patterns of activity reflective of episodic odour engrams. Using activity-dependent tagging combined with neural manipulation techniques, we reveal that contextually-relevant odour engrams are stored within the AON and that their activity is necessary and sufficient for the behavioural expression of odour memory. Our findings offer a new model for studying the mechanisms underlying memory representations."
"Improved identification of bacterial and viral infections would reduce morbidity from sepsis, reduce antibiotic overuse, and lower healthcare costs. Here, we develop a generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for acute bacterial and viral infections. We use training data (N = 1069) from 18 retrospective transcriptomic studies. Using only 29 preselected host mRNAs, we train a neural-network classifier with a bacterial-vs-other area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.92 (95% CI 0.90–0.93) and a viral-vs-other AUROC 0.92 (95% CI 0.90–0.93). We then apply this classifier, inflammatix-bacterial-viral-noninfected-version 1 (IMX-BVN-1), without retraining, to an independent cohort (N = 163). In this cohort, IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.86 (95% CI 0.77–0.93), and viral-vs.-other 0.85 (95% CI 0.76–0.93). In patients enrolled within 36 h of hospital admission (N = 70), IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.92 (95% CI 0.83–0.99), and viral-vs.-other 0.91 (95% CI 0.82–0.98). With further study, IMX-BVN-1 could provide a tool for assessing patients with suspected infection and sepsis at hospital admission."
"Variability in daily sleep patterns is an emerging factor linked to metabolic syndrome. However, whether reducing bedtime variability improves markers of disease risk has not been tested. Here, we assessed whether body composition and inflammation were impacted by changes in bedtime variability over a 6-week period, during which, women were instructed to maintain healthy, habitual sleep (HS) patterns (one arm of a randomized trial). Data were available for 37 women (age 34.9 ± 12.4 years, BMI 24.7 ± 2.9 kg/m2, sleep duration 7.58 ± 0.49 h/night). Body composition and leukocyte platelet aggregates (LPA) were measured at baseline and endpoint using magnetic resonance imaging and flow cytometry, respectively. Sleep data were collected daily using wrist actigraphy. Change in bedtime variability was calculated as the difference in the standard deviation (SD) of bedtimes measured during the 2-week screening period and the 6-week intervention period. Results showed that women who reduced their bedtime variability (n = 29) during the intervention had reductions in total (P < 0.001) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (P < 0.001) relative to women who increased/maintained (n = 8) bedtime variability. Similar effects were observed for LPA levels between women who reduced vs increased/maintained bedtime variability (P = 0.011). Thus, reducing bedtime variability, without changing sleep duration, could improve cardiometabolic health by reducing adiposity and inflammation."
"Patient satisfaction with the shape and appearance of their nose after orthognathic surgery-based skeletofacial reconstruction is an important, but often overlooked, outcome. We assessed the nose-related outcomes through a recently developed patient-reported outcome instrument and a widely adopted 3D computer-based objective outcome instrument, to verify any correlation in the results produced by these tools. We collected FACE-Q nose appearance reports (2 scales) and 3D nasal morphometry (10 parameters) from patients with class III skeletal pattern and congenital cleft lip palate deformity (n = 23) or developmental dentofacial deformity (n = 23) after (>12 months) skeletofacial reconstruction. The cleft and dentofacial cohorts demonstrated significantly (p < 0.001) poorer satisfaction scores with regard to the FACE-Q nostrils scale than the normal age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched subjects (n = 107), without any significant difference in FACE-Q nose scale. The cleft cohort had significantly (p < 0.001) smaller nasal length, nasal tip projection, and columellar angle and greater nasal protrusion, alar width, and columellar–labial angle values than the dentofacial and normal cohorts; however, there were no significant differences between the dentofacial versus normal cohorts. The FACE-Q nose and nostrils scales were significantly (p < 0.001; r = −0.26–0.27) correlated to the results of the 3D morphometric analysis, with regard to nasal length, alar width, columella angle, and columellar–labial angle parameters. This study revealed differences in satisfaction with the appearance of the nose according to the type of underlying deformity, and demonstrated a significant correlation (low correlation coefficients) between the patient-reports and 3D image-based outcome measure tools, which has implications for multidisciplinary-centered research, auditing, and clinical care."
"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, especially in males. Females with FXS tend to be relatively mildly affected because of compensation by a second X chromosome with a normal FMR1 gene. In most cases, FXS is caused by an expansion of the CGG repeats (>200 triplets, full mutation, FM) in the 5′-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Premutation alleles (PM, 55–200 repeats), usually lack the clinical features of FXS, are highly unstable when transmitted to offspring and can give rise to FM, especially in female meiosis. We describe a 3-year-old girl with typical FXS, with only a fully expanded FMR1 allele (288 CGG repeats) due to uniparental isodisomy of X chromosome, inherited from mother carrying a premutation allele. The patient’s FMR1 methylation region is completely methylated due to full mutation of CGG repeat. This unusual and rare case indicates the importance of a detailed genomic approach to explain nontraditional Mendelian inheritance pattern."
"The retention of a capsule endoscope (CE) in the stomach and the duodenal bulb during the examination is a troublesome problem, which can make the medical staff spend several hours observing whether the CE enters the descending segment of the duodenum (DSD). This paper investigated and evaluated the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for automatic retention-monitoring of the CE in the stomach or the duodenal bulb. A trained CNN system based on 180,000 CE images of the DSD, stomach, and duodenal bulb was used to assess its recognition of the accuracy by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity and specificity. The AUC for distinguishing the DSD was 0.984. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CNN were 97.8%, 96.0%, 96.1% and 97.8%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 0.42 for the probability score. The deviated rate of the time into the DSD marked by the CNN at less than ±8 min was 95.7% (P < 0.01). These results indicate that the CNN for automatic retention-monitoring of the CE in the stomach or the duodenal bulb can be used as an efficient auxiliary measure in the clinical practice."
"An improved understanding of etiological mechanisms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is urgently needed because the number of affected individuals is projected to increase rapidly as populations age. We present results from a blood-based methylome-wide association study of PD involving meta-analysis of 229 K CpG probes in 1,132 cases and 999 controls from two independent cohorts. We identify two previously unreported epigenome-wide significant associations with PD, including cg06690548 on chromosome 4. We demonstrate that cg06690548 hypermethylation in PD is associated with down-regulation of the SLC7A11 gene and show this is consistent with an environmental exposure, as opposed to medications or genetic factors with effects on DNA methylation or gene expression. These findings are notable because SLC7A11 codes for a cysteine-glutamate anti-porter regulating levels of the antioxidant glutathione, and it is a known target of the environmental neurotoxin β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). Our study identifies the SLC7A11 gene as a plausible biological target in PD."
"Evidence of the association between anemia and risk of PD (Parkinson’s disease) have been accumulating. This study aimed to examine the relationship between anemia and risk of PD in Korean older adults. Korean adults aged 50 years or older who participated in the Korean National Screening Program (n = 12,342,278) between 2009 and 2013 were followed until 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of PD, and participants were followed for a mean period of 5.0 years. At the end of follow-up, 3,844 adults were diagnosed with PD. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants with anemia had decreased risk of PD compared to adults without anemia (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.894, 95% CI: 0.809–0.989). Furthermore, aHR of PD was 0.698 (95% CI: 0.546–0.891) in moderate to severe anemia and 0.938 (95% CI: 0.843–1.044) in mild anemia. The protective effect of anemia was also more profound in men (aHR 0.888, 95% CI: 0.774–1.02) than in women (aHR 0.905, 95% CI: 0.782–1.048). In conclusion, anemia was associated with lower risk of PD, particularly for patients with moderate to severe anemia. Our study suggests that further studies may be needed to clarify the relationship between anemia and PD."
"Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), typically smartphone apps, learn to deliver therapeutic content when users need it. The challenge is to “push” content at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3x/day) 90 min into the future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioid-use disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with person-level demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent overall accuracy—as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoring—but this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For predictions of presence, “believability” (positive predictive value, PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based “digital phenotyping” inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to achieve or even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals."
"Cancer-related mortality of solid tumors remains the major cause of death worldwide. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from cancer cells harbors specific somatic mutations. Sequencing ctDNA opens opportunities to non-invasive population screening and lays foundations for personalized therapy. In this study, two commercially available platforms, Roche’s Avenio ctDNA Expanded panel and QIAgen’s QIAseq Human Comprehensive Cancer  panel were compared for (1) panel coverage of clinically relevant variants; (2) target enrichment specificity and sequencing performance; (3) the sensitivity; (4) concordance and (5) sequencing coverage using the same human blood sample with ultra-deep next-generation sequencing. Our finding suggests that Avenio detected somatic mutations in common cancers in over 70% of patients while QIAseq covered nearly 90% with a higher average number of variants per patient (Avenio: 3; QIAseq: 8 variants per patient). Both panels demonstrated similar on-target rate and percentage of reads mapped. However, Avenio had more uniform sequencing coverage across regions with different GC content. Avenio had a higher sensitivity and concordance compared with QIAseq at the same sequencing depth. This study identifies a unique niche for the application of each of the panel and allows the scientific community to make an informed decision on the technologies to meet research or application needs."
"We evaluated pathophysiological characteristics of the lower urinary tract dysfunction in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. STZ (60 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into male Wistar rats. In vitro bladder muscle strip experiments, in vivo cystometry, and simultaneous recordings of bladder pressure + urethral perfusion pressure (BP + UPP) with or without intravenous administration of L-arginine (300 mg/kg) or tadalafil (0.03 mg/kg) were performed at several time points. In vitro muscle strip experiments demonstrated that diabetic rats had significantly higher contractile responses to carbachol at 4–16 weeks, and a tendency for higher contractile responses to electrical field stimulation at 4–12 weeks, but this was reversed at 16 weeks. Diabetic rats had significant increases in voided volume, residual volume, bladder capacity, maximal voiding pressure, and amplitude and frequency of non-voiding contractions at 16 weeks. Tadalafil decreased the residual volume in diabetic rats. Diabetic rats had significantly higher UPP nadir and mean UPP during high-frequency oscillation at 16 weeks, which were reversed by tadalafil or L-arginine administration. The present results suggest that urethral relaxation failure, probably related to impairment of the NO/cGMP signalling pathway, rather than bladder contractile dysfunction may be a prominent cause for voiding dysfunction in STZ-induced chronic diabetic rats."
"Many diseases, including cancer, have been associated with impaired regulation of angiogenesis, of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a key regulator. Here, we test the contribution of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) to VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Ndrg1−/− mice exhibit impaired VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in corneas. Tumor angiogenesis induced by cancer cells that express high levels of VEGF-A was also reduced in a mouse dorsal air sac assay. Furthermore, NDRG1 deficiency in ECs prevented angiogenic sprouting from the aorta and the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and ERK1/2 by VEGF-A without affecting the expression and function of VEGFR2. Finally, we show that NDRG1 formed a complex with PLCγ1 through its phosphorylation sites, and the inhibition of PLCγ1 dramatically suppressed VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in the mouse cornea, suggesting an essential role of NDRG1 in VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis through PLCγ1 signaling."
"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents most of lung cancers, is often diagnosed at an advanced metastatic stage. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying metastasis is key to understanding the development of NSCLC. The expression of B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BCAP31), calreticulin, glucose-regulated protein 78, and glucose-regulated protein 94 were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining of 360 NSCLC patients. It resulted that the high-level expression of the four proteins, but particularly BCAP31, predicted inferior overall survival. What’s more, BCAP31 was closely associated with histological grade and p53 status, which was verified by seven cohorts of NSCLC transcript microarray datasets. Then, three NSCLC cell lines were transfected to observe behavior changes BCAP31 caused, we found the fluctuation of BCAP31 significantly influenced the migration, invasion of NSCLC cells. To identify the pathway utilized by BCAP31, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was firstly performed, showing Akt/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway was the significant one, which was verified by immunofluorescence, kinase phosphorylation and cellular behavioral observations. Finally, the data of label-free mass spectroscopy implied that BCAP31 plays a role in a fundamental biological process. This study provides the first demonstration of BCAP31 as a novel prognostic factor related to metastasis and suggests a new therapeutic strategy for NSCLC."
"The growing field of immunometabolism has taught us how metabolic cellular reactions and processes not only provide a means to generate ATP and biosynthetic precursors, but are also a way of controlling immunity and inflammation. Metabolic reprogramming of immune cells is essential for both inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory responses. Four anti-inflammatory therapies, DMF, Metformin, Methotrexate and Rapamycin all work by affecting metabolism and/or regulating or mimicking endogenous metabolites with anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence is emerging for the targeting of specific metabolic events as a strategy to limit inflammation in different contexts. Here we discuss these recent developments and speculate on the prospect of targeting immunometabolism in the effort to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. As accumulating evidence for roles of an intricate and elaborate network of metabolic processes, including lipid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism provides key focal points for developing new therapies, we here turn our attention to glycolysis and the TCA cycle to provide examples of how metabolic intermediates and enzymes can provide potential novel therapeutic targets."
"Bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs) play an important role in pathogenesis of Gram-negative infections. Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli contain a well-defined T3SS but in addition a second T3SS termed E. coli T3SS 2 (ETT2) has been described in a number of strains of E. coli. The majority of pathogenic E. coli contain elements of a genetic locus encoding ETT2, but which has undergone significant mutational attrition rendering it without predicted function. Only a very few strains have been reported to contain an intact ETT2 locus. To investigate the occurrence of the ETT2 locus in strains of human pathogenic E. coli, we carried out genomic sequencing of 162 isolates obtained from patient blood cultures in Scotland. We found that 22 of 26 sequence type (ST) 69 isolates from this collection contained an intact ETT2 together with an associated eip locus which encodes putative secreted ETT2 effectors as well as eilA, a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of ETT2 associated genes. Using a reporter gene for eilA activation, we defined conditions under which this gene was differentially activated. Analysis of published E. coli genomes with worldwide representation showed that ST69 contained an intact ETT2 in these strains as well. The conservation of the genes encoding ETT2 in human pathogenic ST69 strains strongly suggests it has importance in infection, although its exact functional role remains obscure."
"The lineage specification of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) is tightly regulated by a wide range of factors. Recently, the versatile functions of ZBP1 (also known as DAI or DLM-1) have been reported in the blood circulation and immune systems. However, the biological function of ZBP1 during the lineage specification of MSCs is still unknown. In the present study, we found that ZBP1 was upregulated during osteogenesis but downregulated during adipogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (mBMSCs). ZBP1 was highly expressed in osteoblasts but expressed at a relatively low level in marrow adipocytes. Knockdown of ZBP1 inhibited alkaline phosphataseactivity, extracellular matrix mineralization, and osteogenesis-related gene expression in vitro and reduced ectopic bone formation in vivo. Knockdown of ZBP1 also promoted adipogenesis in MSCs in vitro. Conversely, the overexpression of ZBP1 increased the osteogenesis but suppressed the adipogenesis of MSCs. When the expression of ZBP1 was rescued, the osteogenic capacity of ZBP1-depleted mBMSCs was restored at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ZBP1, a newly identified target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, was required for β-catenin translocation into nuclei. Collectively, our results indicate that ZBP1 is a novel regulator of bone and fat transdifferentiation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
"Poor postoperative pain control impairs patient recovery and lengthens the duration of hospitalization after various surgeries. Local infiltration analgesia(LIA) has become an effective method for managing postoperative pain. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LIA with ropivacaine for postoperative pain control after cervical laminoplasty. In total, 68 patients undergoing cervical laminoplasty were included for retrospective review and divided into ropivacaine and control groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, postoperative analgesic consumption, operative duration, intraoperative blood loss volume, incision length, hospitalization duration and incidence of complications were analyzed. In the ropivacaine group, the VAS score was 3.2 ± 1.4 at 4 hours postoperatively, which was lower than that of the control group(4.0 ± 1.4, P = 0.024). At 8, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, a significant difference was detected in the VAS score between the two groups(P ≤ 0.015). Sufentanil consumption was less in the ropivacaine group than in the control group in the first 4 hours postoperatively (25.6 ± 6.3 µg vs 32.2 ± 6.8 µg, P < 0.001), and similar results were observed in the first 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively(P < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue analgesia in the ropivacaine group(8/33 vs 18/35 at 4–8 hours, P = 0.021; 9/33 vs 21/35 at 8–12 hours, P = 0.007). The hospitalization duration and time to ambulation were shorter in the ropivacaine group(8.5 ± 1.4 vs 9.6 ± 1.6 for postoperative duration, P = 0.002; 2.9 ± 0.7 vs 3.5 ± 0.8 for time to ambulation, P = 0.001). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower in the ropivacaine group than in the control group(30.3% vs 54.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, LIA with ropivacaine could effectively reduce postoperative pain, and postoperative analgesic consumption, and promote recovery after cervical laminoplasty."
"The estrogen signaling pathway has been reported to modulate prostate cancer (PCa) progression through the activity of estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ). Given that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are used to treat breast cancer, ERs have been proposed as attractive therapeutic targets in PCa. However, many inconsistencies regarding the expression of ERs and the efficacy of SERMs for PCa treatment exist, notably due to the use of ERβ antibodies lacking specificity and treatments with high SERM concentrations leading to off-target effects. To end this confusion, our objective was to study the impact of estrogenic and anti-estrogenic ligands in well-studied in vitro PCa models with appropriate controls, dosages, and ER subtype-specific antibodies. When using physiologically relevant concentrations of nine estrogenic/anti-estrogenic compounds, including five SERMs, we observed no significant modulation of PCa cell proliferation. Using RNA-seq and validated antibodies, we demonstrate that these PCa models do not express ERs. In contrast, RNA-seq from PCa samples from patients have detectable expression of ERα. Overall, our study reveals that commonly used PCa models are inappropriate to study ERs and indicate that usage of alternative models is essential to properly assess the roles of the estrogen signaling pathway in PCa."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the association of body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and smoking status with the occurrence of Bell’s palsy. The Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort of a ≥ 40-year-old population from 2000–2003 was used. A total of 5,632 Bell’s palsy participants were matched with 22,528 control participants in terms of age, sex, income, region of residence, and past medical histories of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Bell’s palsy was classified by a history of ≥2 diagnoses with ICD-10 code (G510) and steroid treatment. BMI (kg/m2) was classified as <18.5 (underweight), ≥18.5 to <23 (normal), ≥23 to <25 (overweight), ≥25 to <30 (obese I), and ≥30 (obese II). Alcohol consumption was divided into non-drinkers and those who drank 2–3 times a month, 1–2 times a week, and ≥3 times a week. Smoking status was categorized as current smokers, past smokers, and non-smokers. The odds of obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking with Bell’s palsy were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. BMI showed proportionally positive associations with Bell’s palsy (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 0.61 [0.47–0.79] for underweight, 1.16 [1.08–1.26] for normal, 1.24 [1.15–1.33] for obese I, and 1.61 [1.38–1.88] for obese II, P < 0.001). The odds of alcohol consumption with Bell’s palsy were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82–0.99) for 2–3 times a month, 0.77 (95% CI = 0.69–0.85) for 1–2 times a week, and 0.79 (95% CI = 0.71–0.88) for ≥3 times a week compared to nondrinkers (P < 0.001). Smoking did not show a relationship with the occurrence of Bell’s palsy. Obesity was related to the risk of Bell’s palsy in the population over 40 years old. On the other hand, alcohol consumption was negatively associated with the occurrence of Bell’s palsy."
"Developing prognostic biomarkers for specific cancer types that accurately predict patient survival is increasingly important in clinical research and practice. Despite the enormous potential of prognostic signatures, proposed models have found limited implementations in routine clinical practice. Herein, we propose a generic, RNA sequencing platform independent, statistical framework named whole transcriptome signature for prognostic prediction to generate prognostic gene signatures. Using ovarian cancer and lung adenocarcinoma as examples, we provide evidence that our prognostic signatures overperform previous reported signatures, capture prognostic features not explained by clinical variables, and expose biologically relevant prognostic pathways, including those involved in the immune system and cell cycle. Our approach demonstrates a robust method for developing prognostic gene expression signatures. In conclusion, our statistical framework can be generally applied to all cancer types for prognostic prediction and might be extended to other human diseases. The proposed method is implemented as an R package (PanCancerSig) and is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/Cheng-Lab-GitHub/PanCancer_Signature)."
"Polymeric nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning either blank (PVA) or loaded with minoxidil sulphate have yielded optimum fibers with an average diameter 273 nm, and 511 nm, respectively. Thermal analysis of nanofibers indicated no chemical interaction. The NMR spectrum confirmed stability of nanofiber as there were no interactions between functional groups. Prepared nanofibers showed a 47.4% encapsulation efficiency and 73% yield. In vitro drug release of minoxidil sulphate from nanofiber exhibited an initial burst release followed by a slower release pattern. Stability studies revealed that minoxidil nanofiber was stable if stored at room temperature and protected from light with only loss of 9.6% of its nominal concentration within 6 months. As a result, the prepared solid/colored formula serves as an ideal formulation for such instable drug in liquid formula taking the advantage of the attractiveness of beauty colored coverage, and the simple, and non-tousled application."
"Studies demonstrated that pneumonia can decrease vitamin A productions and vitamin A reduction/deficiency may promote asthma development. Our previous study showed that neonatal Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) infection promoted asthma development. Whether neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia induced asthma was associated with vitamin A levels remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia on vitamin A expressions, to explore the effects of vitamin A supplement after neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia on adulthood asthma development. Non-lethal S. pneumoniae pneumonia was established by intranasal inoculation of neonatal (1-week-old) female BALB/c mice with D39. S. pneumoniae pneumonia mice were supplemented with or without all-trans retinoic acid 24 hours after infection. Vitamin A concentrations in lung, serum and liver were measured post pneumonia until early adulthood. Four weeks after pneumonia, mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA to induce allergic airway disease (AAD). Twenty-four hours after the final challenge, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected to assess AAD. We stated that serum vitamin A levels in neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia mice were lower than 0.7µmol/L from day 2–7 post infection, while pulmonary vitamin A productions were significantly lower than those in the control mice from day 7–28 post infection. Vitamin A supplement after neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia significantly promoted Foxp3+Treg and Th1 productions, decreased Th2 and Th17 cells expressions, alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammatory cells infiltration during AAD. Our data suggest that neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia induce serum vitamin A deficiency and long-time lung vitamin A reduction, vitamin A supplement after neonatal S. pneumoniae pneumonia inhibit the progression of asthma by altering CD4+T cell subsets."
"In glaucoma, retinal ganglion cells are damaged, leading to the progressive constriction of the visual field. We have previously shown that the valosin-containing protein (VCP) modulators, Kyoto University Substance (KUS)121 and KUS187, prevent the death of retinal ganglion cells in animal models of glaucoma, including the one generated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neurotoxicity. KUSs appeared to avert endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by maintaining ATP levels, resulting in the protection of ganglion cells from cell death. To further elucidate the protective mechanisms of KUSs, we examined gene expression profiles in affected ganglion cells. We first injected KUS-treated mice with NMDA and then isolated the affected retinal ganglion cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Gene expression in the cells was quantified using a next-generation sequencer. Resultantly, we found that KUS121 upregulated several genes involved in energy metabolism. In addition, we observed the upregulation of Zfp667, which has been reported to suppress apoptosis-related genes and prevent cell death. These results further support the suitability of KUS121 as a therapeutic drug in protecting retinal ganglion cells in ophthalmic disorders, such as glaucoma."
"Normal-range sleep duration is an important factor for general health and metabolism, and insufficient or excessive sleep is associated with chronic metabolic disease. Among the many factors that affect sleep duration, sun exposure plays an important role in maintaining regular circadian rhythm and is also involved in the production and activation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which regulates various functions in the body. However, 25(OH)D is available through food and various nutritional supplements without sun exposure, so it is important to find out the complex relationship among sun exposure, vitamin D status, and sleep duration. The relationship between sun exposure, vitamin D status, and sleep duration was analyzed in the nationwide survey and examination of 25,534 study populations, after adjusting for demographic characteristics, physical characteristics, lifestyle status, and socio-demographic variables. Vitamin D status alone did not show the relationship with sleep duration, although there were statistical relationships in the various factors including sun exposure with sleep duration. There was a statistical difference in 25(OH)D according to sleep duration, only in low sun exposure group. Subjects with low sun exposure and excessive sleep duration comparatively lower 25(OH)D than those with normal-range sleep, even after adjustment for potentially confounding factors. Individuals with limited exposure to sunlight should maintain adequate vitamin D status to have an appropriate sleep duration for health."
"The rabbit is a much-used experimental animal in renal tubule physiology studies. Although a monogastric mammal, the rabbit is a known hindgut fermenter. That ruminant species excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi) mainly through the digestive system while non-ruminants eliminate surplus phosphate primarily through the renal system are acknowledged facts. To understand phosphate homeostasis in the acidotic rabbit, anaesthetized animals were infused with hydrochloric acid, after which they underwent intravenous phosphate loading. Biofluids were collected during the infusion process for analysis. Plasma Pi increased (7.9 ± 1.7 mmoles.Litre−1 (N = 5) vs 2.2 ± 0.4 mmoles.Litre−1 (N = 10) pre-infusion, (p < 0.001)), while urinary phosphate excretion was also enhanced (74.4 ± 15.3 from a control value of 4.7 ± 3 µmol.min−1 (N = 9), pre-infusion, p < 0.001)) over an 82.5 minute Pi loading period. However, the fractional excretion of Pi (FePi) only increased from 14.2 ± 5.4% to a maximum of 61.7 ± 19% (N = 5) over the infusion period. Furthermore, the renal tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmPi/GFR) computed to 3.5 mmol.L−1, while a reading of 23.2 µmol.min−1.Kg.0.75 was obtained for the transport maximum for Pi (TmPi). The high reabsorptivity of the rabbit nephrons coupled with possibly a high secretory capacity of the salivary glands for Pi, may constitute a unique physiological mechanism that ensures the rabbit hindgut receives adequate phosphate to regulate caecal pH in favour of the resident metabolically - active microbiota. The handling of Pi by the rabbit is in keeping with the description of this animal as a monogastric, pseudo-ruminant herbivore."
"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an inherited disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) that arise from neoplastic Schwann cells (SCs). NF2-associated VSs are often accompanied by meningioma (MN), and the majority of NF2 patients show loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor. mTORC1 and mTORC2-specific serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) are constitutively activated in MN with loss of NF2. In a recent high-throughput kinome screen in NF2-null human arachnoidal and meningioma cells, we showed activation of EPH RTKs, c-KIT, and SFK members independent of mTORC1/2 activation. Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of combination therapy with the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. For these reasons, we investigated activated mTORC1/2 and EPH receptor-mediated signaling in sporadic and NF2-associated VS. Using primary human VS cells and a mouse allograft model of schwannoma, we evaluated the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib as monotherapies and in combination. Escalating dose-response experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 µM). In vivo, while AZD2014 and dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy exceeds that of either drug. Co-targeting the mTOR and EPH receptor pathways with these or similar compounds may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for VS, a condition for which there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy."
"Severe neurological complications following infective endocarditis remain a major problem with high mortality rate. The long-term neurological consequences following infective endocarditis remain uncertain. Otherwise, neurosurgeries could be performed after these complications; however, few clinical series have reported the results. Therefore, we utilized a large, nationwide database to unveil the long-term mortality and neurosurgical outcome following infective endocarditis. We included patients with a first-time discharge diagnosis of infective endocarditis between January 2001 and December 2013 during hospitalization. Patients were further divided into subgroups consisting of neurological complications under neurosurgical treatment and complications under non-neurosurgical treatment. Long-term result of symptomatic neurological complications after infective endocarditis and all-cause mortality after different kinds of neurosurgeries were analyzed. There were 16,495 patients with infective endocarditis included in this study. Symptomatic neurological complications occurred in 1,035 (6.27%) patients, of which 279 (26.96%) accepted neurosurgical procedures. Annual incidence of neurological complications gradually increased from 3.6% to 7.4% (P < 0.001). The mortality rate among these patients was higher than that among patients without complications (48.5% vs. 46.1%, P = 0.012, increased from 20% initially to nearly 50% over the 5-year follow-up). However, neurosurgery had no effect on the long-term mortality rate (50.9% vs. 47.6%, P = 0.451). Incidence of neurological complications post-infective endocarditis is increasing, and patients with these complications have higher mortality rates than patients without. Neurosurgery in these populations was not associated with higher long-term mortality. Therefore, it should not be ruled out as an option for those with neurological complications."
"Accumulation of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is observed in individuals with insulin resistance as well as insulin-sensitive endurance athletes with high peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), which is called the athlete’s paradox. It remains unclear whether non-athletes with higher fitness levels have IMCL accumulation and higher insulin sensitivity in general. In this study, we investigated the association between IMCL accumulation and muscle insulin sensitivity (M-IS) in subjects with high or low VO2peak. We studied 61 nonobese (BMI, 23 to 25 kg/m2), non-athlete Japanese men. We divided the subjects into four groups based on the median value of VO2peak and IMCL in the soleus muscle. We evaluated M-IS using a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Among subjects with higher VO2peak (n = 32), half of those (n = 16) had lower IMCL levels. Both High-VO2peak groups had higher M-IS than the Low-VO2peak groups. On the other hand, M-IS was comparable between the High-VO2peak/High-IMCL and High-VO2peak/Low-IMCL groups, whereas the High-VO2peak/High-IMCL group had IMCL levels that were twice as high as those in the High-VO2peak/Low-IMCL group. On the other hand, the High-VO2peak/High-IMCL group had significantly higher physical activity levels (approximately 1.8-fold) than the other three groups. In conclusion, in nonobese, non-athlete Japanese men, subjects with higher VO2peak and higher IMCL had higher physical activity levels. IMCL accumulation is not associated with insulin resistance in individuals with higher or lower fitness levels."
"Background. More than 330 food additives (e.g. artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers, dyes) are authorized in Europe, with a great variability of use across food products. Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and co-occurrence of food additives in a large-scale database of foods and beverages available on the French market. Design. The open access crowdsourced Open Food Facts database (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) was used to retrieve the composition of food and beverage products commonly marketed on the French market (n = 126,556), based on the ingredients list. Clustering of food additive variables was used in order to determine groups of additives frequently co-occurring in food products. The clusters were confirmed by network analysis, using the eLasso method. Results. Fifty-three-point eight percent of food products contained at least 1 food additive and 11.3% at least 5. Food categories most likely to contain food additives (in more than 85% of food items) were artificially sweetened beverages, ice creams, industrial sandwiches, biscuits and cakes. The most frequently used food additives were citric acid, lecithins and modified starches (>10,000 products each). Some food additives with suspected health effects also pertained to the top 50: sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, carrageenan, monosodium glutamate, sulfite ammonia caramel, acesulfame K, sucralose, (di/tri/poly) phosphates, mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, potassium sorbate, cochineal, potassium metabisulphite, sodium alginate, and bixin (>800 food products each). We identified 6 clusters of food additives frequently co-occurring in food products. Conclusions. Food additives are widespread in industrial French products and some clusters of additives frequently co-occurring in food products were identified. These results pave the way to future etiological studies merging composition data to food consumption data to investigate their association with chronic disease risk, in particular potential ‘cocktail effects’."
"Deletion of dystrobrevin binding protein 1 has been linked to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 7 (HPS-7), a rare disease characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and retinal dysfunction. We studied dysbindin-1 null mutant mice (Dys−/−) to shed light on retinal neurodevelopment defects in HPS-7. We analyzed the expression of a focused set of miRNAs in retina of wild type (WT), Dys+/− and Dys−/− mice. We also investigated the retinal function of these mice through electroretinography (ERG). We found that miR-101-3p, miR-137, miR-186-5p, miR-326, miR-382-5p and miR-876-5p were up-regulated in Dys−/−mice retina. Dys−/− mice showed significant increased b-wave in ERG, compared to WT mice. Bioinformatic analysis highlighted that dysregulated miRNAs target synaptic plasticity and dopaminergic signaling pathways, affecting retinal functions of Dys−/− mice. Overall, the data indicate potential mechanisms in retinal neurodevelopment of Dys−/− mice, which may have translational significance in HSP-7 patients, both in terms of diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and novel pharmacological targets."
"The humoral immune response requires germinal centers to produce high-affinity antigen-specific antibodies that counter pathogens. Numerous studies have provided a better understanding of how metabolic pathways regulate the development, activation and functions of immune cells. Germinal centers are transient, highly dynamic microanatomic structures that develop in lymphoid organs during a T-cell-dependent humoral immune response. Analysis of germinal centers provides an opportunity to understand how metabolic programs control the differentiation and function of highly specialized germinal center B cells and follicular helper CD4+ T cells. Targeting immunometabolism during the germinal center response may afford the possibility to improve vaccine design and to develop new therapies to alleviate autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the major metabolic pathways that are used by germinal center B and T cells, as well as the plasma cells that they produce, all of which are influenced by the microenvironment of this unique structure of the adaptive immune system."
"The genomics-based molecular classifications aim at identifying more homogeneous classes than immunohistochemistry, associated with a more uniform clinical outcome. We conducted an in silico analysis on a meta-dataset including gene expression data from 5342 clinically defined ER+/HER2− breast cancers (BC) and DNA copy number/mutational and proteomic data. We show that the Basal (16%) versus Luminal (74%) subtypes as defined using the 80-gene signature differ in terms of response/vulnerability to systemic therapies of BC. The Basal subtype is associated with better chemosensitivity, lesser benefit from adjuvant hormone therapy, and likely better sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, platinum salts and immune therapy, and other targeted therapies under development such as FGFR inhibitors. The Luminal subtype displays potential better sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and vulnerability to targeted therapies such as PIK3CA, AR and Bcl-2 inhibitors. Expression profiles are very different, showing an intermediate position of the ER+/HER2− Basal subtype between the ER+/HER2− Luminal and ER− Basal subtypes, and let suggest a different cell-of-origin. Our data suggest that the ER+/HER2− Basal and Luminal subtypes should not be assimilated and treated as a homogeneous group."
"The spleen is a large lymphoid organ located in the abdomen that filters blood and regulates the immune system. The extent of mobilization of splenic immune cells to peripheral tissues in health and disease, however, remains poorly understood. This is due, in large part, to a lack of in vivo, spleen-specific lineage tagging strategies. Here, we describe a detailed practical protocol of spleen transplantation and its evaluation for long-term graft survival. Unlike implantation of splenic morsels in the great omentum, our approach uses arterial and venous anastomoses which rapidly restores blood flow and facilitates long-term survival of the graft. The use of congenic mouse strains permits the use of immunofluorescence and flow cytometry-based methodologies to unambiguously track the migration of spleen-derived cells to peripheral tissues."
"Fatigue related to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is considered a multidimensional symptom, manifesting in several dimensions such as physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fatigue. This study investigated in 264 patients with severe primary MS-related fatigue (median MS duration 6.8 years, mean age 48.1 years, 75% women) whether subgroups can be distinguished based on these dimensions. Subsequently, we tested whether MS-related fatigue consists of a single common unidimensional factor. Subscale scores on four self-reported fatigue questionnaires, including the Checklist of Individual Strength, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale and the SF36 vitality, were used in a cluster analysis to identify patients with similar fatigue characteristics. Next, all 54 items were included in exploratory factor analysis to test unidimensionality. Study results show that in patients with a treatment indication for primary MS-related fatigue, fatigue profiles are based on severity and not on the various dimensions of fatigue. The three profiles found, suggested one underlying fatigue dimension, but this could not be confirmed. Factor analysis of all 54 items resulted in 8 factors, confirming the multidimensional construct of the included fatigue questionnaires."
"Microscopic indications of malignancy and hallmark molecules of cancer are pivotal to determining cancer patient prognosis and subsequent medical intervention. Here, we found that compared to apical expression of Cdc42, which indicated that basal expression of Cdc42 occurred at the migrating cell front, glandular basal expression of Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42) in tissues indicated poorer prognoses for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The current study shows that activated Cdc42 was rapidly recruited to the migrating CRC cell front after VEGF stimulation through engagement of membrane-anchored neuropilin-1 (NRP1). When VEGF signalling was blocked with NRP1 knockdown or ATWLPPR (A7R, antagonist of VEGF/NRP1 interaction), Cdc42 activation and relocation to the cell front was attenuated, and filopodia and invadopodia formation was inhibited. The VEGF/NRP1 axis regulates directional migration, invasion, and metastasis through Cdc42 activation and relocation resulting from actin filament polymerisation of the extensions of membrane protrusions. Collectively, the immuno-micromorphological pattern of subcellular Cdc42 at the cell front indicated aggressive behaviours and predicted poor prognosis in CRC patients. Disruption of the intra- and extracellular interactions of the VEGF/NRP1 axis or Cdc42 relocation could be performed in clinical practice because it might inhibit cancer cell motility and metastasis."
"Dairy cattle undergo dynamic physiological changes over the course of a full lactation into the dry period, which impacts their immunocompetence. During activation, T cells undergo a characteristic rewiring to increase the uptake of glucose and metabolically reprogram to favor aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. To date it remains to be completely elucidated how the altered energetic demands associated with lactation in dairy cows impacts T cell metabolic reprogramming. Thus, in our ex vivo studies we have examined the influence of stage of lactation (early lactation into the dry period) on cellular metabolism in activated bovine CD4+ T cells. Results showed higher rates of glycolytic function in activated CD4+ T cells from late lactation and dry cows compared to cells from early and mid-lactation cows. Similarly, protein and mRNA expression of cytokines were higher in CD4+ T cells from dry cows than CD4+ T cells from lactating cows. The data suggest CD4+ T cells from lactating cows have an altered metabolic responsiveness that could impact the immunocompetence of these animals, particularly those in early lactation, and increase their susceptibility to infection."
"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe disorder of lung vasculature that causes right heart failure. Homoeostatic effects of flow-activated transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) are compromised in PAH. Here, we show that KLF2-induced exosomal microRNAs, miR-181a-5p and miR-324-5p act together to attenuate pulmonary vascular remodelling and that their actions are mediated by Notch4 and ETS1 and other key regulators of vascular homoeostasis. Expressions of KLF2, miR-181a-5p and miR-324-5p are reduced, while levels of their target genes are elevated in pre-clinical PAH, idiopathic PAH and heritable PAH with missense p.H288Y KLF2 mutation. Therapeutic supplementation of miR-181a-5p and miR-324-5p reduces proliferative and angiogenic responses in patient-derived cells and attenuates disease progression in PAH mice. This study shows that reduced KLF2 signalling is a common feature of human PAH and highlights the potential therapeutic role of KLF2-regulated exosomal miRNAs in PAH and other diseases associated with vascular remodelling."
"The BCL-2 antagonist venetoclax is highly effective in multiple myeloma (MM) patients exhibiting the 11;14 translocation, the mechanistic basis of which is unknown. In evaluating cellular energetics and metabolism of t(11;14) and non-t(11;14) MM, we determine that venetoclax-sensitive myeloma has reduced mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this, low electron transport chain (ETC) Complex I and Complex II activities correlate with venetoclax sensitivity. Inhibition of Complex I, using IACS-010759, an orally bioavailable Complex I inhibitor in clinical trials, as well as succinate ubiquinone reductase (SQR) activity of Complex II, using thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) or introduction of SDHC R72C mutant, independently sensitize resistant MM to venetoclax. We demonstrate that ETC inhibition increases BCL-2 dependence and the ‘primed’ state via the ATF4-BIM/NOXA axis. Further, SQR activity correlates with venetoclax sensitivity in patient samples irrespective of t(11;14) status. Use of SQR activity in a functional-biomarker informed manner may better select for MM patients responsive to venetoclax therapy."
"BackgroundThe androgen receptor (AR) is a key prostate cancer drug target. Suppression of AR signaling mediated by the full-length AR (AR-FL) is the therapeutic goal of all existing AR-directed therapies. AR-targeting agents impart therapeutic benefit, but lead to AR aberrations that underlie disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Among the AR aberrations specific to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AR variants (AR-Vs) have emerged as important indicators of disease progression and therapeutic resistance.MethodsWe conducted a systemic review of the literature focusing on recent laboratory studies on AR-Vs following our last review article published in 2016. Topics ranged from measurement and detection, molecular origin, regulation, genomic function, and preclinical therapeutic targeting of AR-Vs. We provide expert opinions and perspectives on these topics.ResultsTranscript sequences for 22 AR-Vs have been reported in the literature. Different AR-Vs may arise through different mechanisms, and can be regulated by splicing factors and dictated by genomic rearrangements, but a low-androgen environment is a prerequisite for generation of AR-Vs. The unique transcript structures allowed development of in situ and in-solution measurement and detection methods, including mRNA and protein detection, in both tissue and blood specimens. AR-V7 remains the main measurement target and the most extensively characterized AR-V. Although AR-V7 coexists with AR-FL, genomic functions mediated by AR-V7 do not require the presence of AR-FL. The distinct cistromes and transcriptional programs directed by AR-V7 and their coregulators are consistent with genomic features of progressive disease in a low-androgen environment. Preclinical development of AR-V-directed agents currently focuses on suppression of mRNA expression and protein degradation as well as targeting of the amino-terminal domain.ConclusionsCurrent literature continues to support AR-Vs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Laboratory investigations reveal both challenges and opportunities in targeting AR-Vs to overcome resistance to current AR-directed therapies."
"BRUCE is a DNA damage response protein that promotes the activation of ATM and ATR for homologous recombination (HR) repair in somatic cells, making BRUCE a key protector of genomic stability. Preservation of genomic stability in the germline is essential for the maintenance of species. Here, we show that BRUCE is required for the preservation of genomic stability in the male germline of mice, specifically in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Conditional knockout of Bruce in the male germline leads to profound defects in spermatogenesis, including impaired maintenance of spermatogonia and increased chromosomal anomalies during meiosis. Bruce-deficient pachytene spermatocytes frequently displayed persistent DNA breaks. Homologous synapsis was impaired, and nonhomologous associations and rearrangements were apparent in up to 10% of Bruce-deficient spermatocytes. Genomic instability was apparent in the form of chromosomal fragmentation, translocations, and synapsed quadrivalents and hexavalents. In addition, unsynapsed regions of rearranged autosomes were devoid of ATM and ATR signaling, suggesting an impairment in the ATM- and ATR-dependent DNA damage response of meiotic HR. Taken together, our study unveils crucial functions for BRUCE in the maintenance of spermatogonia and in the regulation of meiotic HR—functions that preserve the genomic stability of the male germline."
"Eucalyptol is one of the most popular volatile components. It is used in many essential oils for relieving sinus and lung congestion caused by a variety of conditions. This pilot study sought to analyze clinical evidence for the effect of the scent of eucalyptol on the cognitive function of elderly people. Seventy nursing-home residents with cognitive impairment were recruited. Three one-week experiments were performed: eucalyptol scent was diffused in bedrooms with a diffuser only at wake-up time in the first experiment, and at wake-up time and bedtime in the second and third experiments. Results showed that although an improvement was not seen when using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cohen-Mansfild Agitation Inventory (CMAI) measures, Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale (DBD) scores improved significantly, even though no subject reported perceiving the scent. The significant improvements of the behaviour were found not only among the subjects whose room had a diffuser but also among the subjects who were exposed to an unperceivable level of eucalyptol drifted in the living room."
"Hearing loss becomes increasingly common with age and affects quality of life. Recently, scientists have published articles about the relationship between metabolic disease and hearing loss. Metabolic disease was previously found to be highly related to an increase in alkaline phosphatase. Thus, there may be an indirect relationship between alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and hearing loss. In this paper, we will demonstrate the relationship between ALP and hearing loss. We included 3877 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants, who represent the noninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States from age 20 to age 69, and examined the association between ALP and frequency distributions of pure-tone air-condition (PTAC) thresholds. After adjusting for pertinent variables, the subjects who belonged to the higher quartiles of ALP tended to have worse hearing thresholds (pure tone average at high and low frequencies) than the first quartile of ALP (p < 0.001). The results showed a positive correlation between ALP and hearing loss, in both males and females (p < 0.001) and in subjects whose body mass indices (BMI) were less than 30 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, ALP may play a role in detecting hearing loss."
"Expression of the matricellular protein CCN1 (CYR61) is associated with inflammation and is required for successful wound repair. Here, we show that CCN1 binds bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns including peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria and lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria. CCN1 opsonizes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and accelerates their removal by phagocytosis and increased production of bactericidal reactive oxygen species in macrophages through the engagement of integrin αvβ3. Mice with myeloid-specific Ccn1 deletion and knock-in mice expressing CCN1 unable to bind αvβ3 are more susceptible to infection by S. aureus or P. aeruginosa, resulting in increased mortality and organ colonization. Furthermore, CCN1 binds directly to TLR2 and TLR4 to activate MyD88-dependent signaling, cytokine expression and neutrophil mobilization. CCN1 is therefore a pattern recognition receptor that opsonizes bacteria for clearance and functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern to activate inflammatory responses, activities that contribute to wound healing and tissue repair."
"Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) hold great promise for disease modeling and drug discovery. However, PSC-CMs exhibit immature phenotypes in culture, and the lack of maturity limits their broad applications. While physical and functional analyses are generally used to determine the status of cardiomyocyte maturation, they could be time-consuming and often present challenges in comparing maturation-enhancing strategies. Therefore, there is a demand for a method to assess cardiomyocyte maturation rapidly and reproducibly. In this study, we found that Myomesin-2 (Myom2), encoding M-protein, is upregulated postnatally, and based on this, we targeted TagRFP to the Myom2 locus in mouse embryonic stem cells. Myom2-RFP+ PSC-CMs exhibited more mature phenotypes than RFP- cells in morphology, function and transcriptionally, conductive to sarcomere shortening assays. Using this system, we screened extracellular matrices (ECMs) and identified laminin-511/521 as potent enhancers of cardiomyocyte maturation. Together, we developed and characterized a novel fluorescent reporter system for the assessment of cardiomyocyte maturation and identified potent maturation-enhancing ECMs through this simple and rapid assay. This system is expected to facilitate use of PSC-CMs in a variety of scientific and medical investigations."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global healthcare problem. Radioresistance is a huge setback for CRC radiotherapy. In this text, the roles and molecular mechanisms of long non-coding RNA HOTAIR in CRC tumorigenesis and radioresistance were further investigated. ATG12 mRNA, HOTAIR, and microRNA-93 (miR-93) levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. Protein levels of LC3 I, LC3 II, p62, ATG12, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by western blotting assay in cells and were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in tissues. Cell survival fractions, viability, and apoptotic rates were determined by clonogenic survival assay, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The relationships of HOTAIR, miR-93, and ATG12 were tested by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Mouse xenograft tumor models were established to investigate the influence of HOTAIR knockdown on CRC radioresistance in vivo. We found that HOTAIR expression was markedly upregulated in plasma from CRC patients after radiotherapy and CRC cells after irradiation. HOTAIR knockdown, miR-93 overexpression, or ATG12 silencing weakened cell viability, induced cell apoptosis, inhibited cell autophagy, and enhanced cell radiosensitivity in CRC. HOTAIR exerted its functions by downregulating miR-93. Moreover, HOTAIR functioned as a molecular sponge of miR-93 to regulate ATG12 expression. ATG12 protein expression was markedly upregulated and associated with miR-93 and HOTAIR expression in CRC tissues. Furthermore, HOTAIR knockdown enhanced radiosensitivity of CRC xenograft tumors by regulating miR-93/ATG12 axis. In conclusion, HOTAIR knockdown potentiated radiosensitivity through regulating miR-93/ATG12 axis in CRC, further elucidating the roles and molecular basis of HOTAIR in CRC radioresistance."
"Clinical evaluation of skin lesions requires precise and reproducible technologies for their qualitative and quantitative assessment. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a custom-built dermatologic OCT system for longitudinal assessment of intradermal volumes in a mouse model. The OCT, based on an akinetic swept laser working at 1310 nm was employed for visualization and quantification of intradermal deposits of three different hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel formulations – one commercial and two test substances. Hydrogels were applied in 22 BALB/c mice, and measurements were performed over a six-month time period. All hydrogels increased in volume within the first weeks and degraded steadily thereafter. The half-lifes of the test hydrogels (27.2 ± 13.6 weeks for Hydrogel 1, 31.5 ± 17.2 weeks for Hydrogel 2) were higher in comparison to the commercially available HA hydrogel (21.4 ± 12.0 weeks), although differences were not significant. The sphericity parameter was used for evaluation of the deposit geometry. While on the injection day the sphericities were similar (~0.75 ± 0.04), at later time points significant differences between the different test substances were found (T24: PRV 0.59 ± 0.09, Hydrogel 1 0.70 ± 0.11, Hydrogel 2 0.78 ± 0.07; p ≤ 0.012 for all pairs). This study shows the applicability of OCT imaging for quantitative assessment of the volumetric behavior of intradermal deposits in vivo."
"Paclitaxel induces peripheral neuropathy as a side effect of cancer treatment. The underlying causes are unclear, but epidermal, unmyelinated axons have been shown to be the first to degenerate. We previously utilized an in vivo zebrafish model to show that the epidermal matrix-metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) induces degeneration of unmyelinated axons, whereas pharmacological inhibition of MMP-13 prevented axon degeneration. However, the precise functions by which MMP-13 is regulated and affects axons remained elusive. In this study, we assessed mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation as possible inducers of MMP-13, and we analyzed MMP-13-dependent damage. We show that the small ROS, H2O2, is increased in basal keratinocytes following treatment with paclitaxel. Cytoplasmic H2O2 appears to derive, at least in part, from mitochondrial damage, leading to upregulation of MMP-13, which in turn underlies increased epidermal extracellular matrix degradation. Intriguingly, also axonal mitochondria show signs of damage, such as fusion/fission defects and vacuolation, but axons do not show increased levels of H2O2. Since MMP-13 inhibition prevents axon degeneration but does not prevent mitochondrial vacuolation, we suggest that vacuolization occurs independently of axonal damage. Finally, we show that MMP-13 dysregulation also underlies paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in mammals, indicating that epidermal mitochondrial H2O2 and its effectors could be targeted for therapeutic interventions."
"Driver mutations and chromosomal aneuploidy are major determinants of tumorigenesis that exhibit complex relationships. Here, we identify associations between driver mutations and chromosomal aberrations that define two tumor clusters, with distinct regimes of tumor evolution underpinned by unique sets of mutations in different components of DNA damage response. Gastrointestinal and endometrial tumors comprise a separate cluster for which chromosomal-arm aneuploidy and driver mutations are mutually exclusive. The landscape of driver mutations in these tumors is dominated by mutations in DNA repair genes that are further linked to microsatellite instability. The rest of the cancer types show a positive association between driver mutations and aneuploidy, and a characteristic set of mutations that involves primarily genes for components of the apoptotic machinery. The distinct sets of mutated genes derived here show substantial prognostic power and suggest specific vulnerabilities of different cancers that might have therapeutic potential."
"Circulating adiponectin (APN) levels decrease with age and obesity. On the other hand, a reduction in APN levels is associated with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We previously showed that aged adiponectin knockout (APN−/−) mice developed Alzheimer’s like pathologies, cerebral insulin resistance, and cognitive impairments. More recently, we also demonstrated that APN deficiency increased Aβ-induced microglia activation and neuroinflammatory responses in 5xFAD mice. There is compelling evidence that deregulated insulin activities or cerebral insulin resistance contributes to neuroinflammation and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that APN levels were reduced in the brain of AD patients and 5xFAD mice. We crossbred 5xFAD mice with APN−/− mice to generate APN-deficient 5xFAD (5xFAD;APN−/−). APN deficiency in 5xFAD mice accelerated amyloid loading, increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and reduced insulin-signaling activities. Pharmacokinetics study demonstrated adipoRon (APN receptor agonist) was a blood–brain barrier penetrant. AdipoRon improved neuronal insulin-signaling activities and insulin sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Chronic adipoRon treatment improved spatial memory functions and significantly rescued neuronal and synaptic loss in 5xFAD and 5xFAD;APN−/− mice. AdipoRon lowered plaque and Aβ levels in AD mice. AdipoRon also exerted anti-inflammatory effects by reducing microglial and astrocytes activation as well as suppressing cerebral cytokines levels. The microglial phagocytic activity toward Aβ was restored after adipoRon treatment. Our results indicated that adipoRon exerts multiple beneficial effects providing important therapeutic implications. We propose chronic adipoRon administration as a potential treatment for AD."
We recently reported a sugar-induced bacterial release of 13-Docosenamide and its ability to quench fluorescein. This simple handle to monitor bacterial growth is readily applicable to develop a quicker antibiotic sensitivity testing method along with a low-cost field-use optical instrumentation. Conditions were standardized to perform this new procedure in the most preferred and CLSI-recommended microdilution format in 12-well strips. A simple and portable optoelectronic prototype was used to capture the image and read the fluorescence signal of the culture medium of the 12-well strips. This new Fluorescence Quenching Method along with the device enabled the choice of the right antibiotic within 8 h of sample collection from the patient. It was compliant to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute’s quality control guidelines. Clinical assessment of the method using 440 urine samples from Urinary Tract Infection patients against 21 routinely used antibiotics showed a 94.3% match with the results of the Standard Disk Diffusion method. This new method saves the precious time taken for and the cost of antibiotic susceptibility testing for quicker and effective treatment with better compliance.
"Vertebral body bone marrow aspirate (V-BMA), easily accessible simultaneously with the preparation of the site for pedicle screw insertion during spinal procedures, is becoming an increasingly used cell therapy approach in spinal surgery. However, the main drawbacks for V-BMA use are the lack of a standardized procedure and of a structural texture with the possibility of diffusion away from the implant site. The aim of this study was to evaluate, characterize and compare the biological characteristics of MSCs from clotted V-BMA and MSCs from whole and concentrate V-BMAs. MSCs from clotted V-BMA showed the highest cell viability and growth factors expression (TGF-β, VEGF-A, FGF2), the greatest colony forming unit (CFU) potency, cellular homogeneity, ability to differentiate towards the osteogenic (COL1AI, TNFRSF11B, BGLAP) and chondrogenic phenotype (SOX9) and the lowest ability to differentiate toward the adipogenic lineage (ADIPOQ) in comparison to all the other culture conditions. Additionally, results revealed that MSCs, differently isolated, expressed different level of HOX and TALE signatures and that PBX1 and MEIS3 were down-regulated in MSCs from clotted V-BMA in comparison to concentrated one. The study demonstrated for the first time that the cellular source inside the clotted V-BMA showed the best biological properties, representing an alternative and advanced cell therapy approach for patients undergoing spinal surgery."
"Pseudo-occlusion (PO) of the cervical internal carotid artery (cICA) can be caused by distal ICA occlusion. We explored the clinical impact of PO after mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Patients who underwent MT to treat distal ICA occlusions between July 2012 and March 2018 were reviewed. A cICA-PO was defined as when single phase computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a gradual decline in contrast above the level of the carotid bulb. We investigated the relationship between a cICA-PO and outcome; we also explored the association between successful recanalization and outcome. Among 71 patients, 40 (56.3%) exhibited cICA-PO and more likely to experience poor outcomes (80.0% vs. 25.8%, P < 0.001), hemorrhagic transformation (32.5% vs. 9.6%, P = 0.01), and a lower rate of successful recanalization (65.0% vs. 90.3%, P = 0.014) than the non-PO group. In binary logistic regression, a cICA-PO was independently associated with a poor outcome (odds ratio, 4.278; 95% CI, 1.080–33.006; P = 0.045). In the cICA-PO group, all patients who failed recanalization (n = 15) experienced poor outcomes, as did 69.2% of patients in whom recanalization was successful (P = 0.018). cICA-POs are common and have worse outcomes than non-PO patients. Patients with cICA-POs are more likely to exhibit poor outcomes after MT, particularly when recanalization fails."
"Induction of antigen-specific immune activation by the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) is a strategy used for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we find that FimH, which is an Escherichia coli adhesion portion, induces toll-like receptor 4-dependent and myeloid differentiation protein 2-independent DC maturation in mice in vivo. A combined treatment regimen with FimH and antigen promotes antigen-specific immune activation, including proliferation of T cells, production of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and infiltration of effector T cells into tumors, which consequently inhibits tumor growth in mice in vivo against melanoma and carcinoma. In addition, combined therapeutic treatment of anti-PD-L1 antibodies and FimH treatment efficiently inhibits CT26 tumor growth in BALB/c mice. Finally, FimH promotes human peripheral blood DC activation and syngeneic T-cell proliferation and activation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that FimH can be a useful adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy."
"This study examined associations between muscle strength and mental health among 2,652 elderly Koreans who participated in the 2015 and 2017 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We measured absolute handgrip strength and calculated handgrip strength relative to body mass index. Dynapenia criteria followed that of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Questionnaires were used to assess mental health indicators including suicidal ideation, depressed mood, and stress status. Among participants, 18.6%, 14.9%, and 6.7% reported stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation, respectively. Dynapenia prevalence was 25.1%. Adjusted odds ratios of stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation for men with dynapenia were 2.15, 2.30, and 2.11, respectively. Significant associations were absent among women. For men, handgrip strength and relative handgrip strength were inversely associated with risk of stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation. For women, handgrip strength and relative handgrip strength were inversely associated with the risk of stress, but not of depressed mood and suicidal ideation. In conclusion, all muscle-strength indices were associated with mental health risks among older men. In older women, low handgrip strength and relative handgrip strength were associated with increased stress. Muscle strength could be a clinical marker of poor mental health in older adults."
"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) is a highly malicious childhood malignancy characterized by specific chromosomal translocations mostly encoding the oncogenic transcription factor PAX3-FOXO1 and therefore also referred to as fusion-positive RMS (FP-RMS). Previously, we have identified fenretinide (retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide) to affect PAX3-FOXO1 expression levels as well as FP-RMS cell viability. Here, we characterize the mode of action of fenretinide in more detail. First, we demonstrate that fenretinide-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) depends on complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, since ROS scavenging as well as complexing of iron completely abolished cell death. Second, we co-treated cells with a range of pharmacological inhibitors of specific cell death pathways including z-vad (apoptosis), necrostatin-1 (necroptosis), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (autophagy), and ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis) together with fenretinide. Surprisingly, none of these inhibitors was able to prevent cell death. Also genetic depletion of key players in the apoptotic and necroptotic pathway (BAK, BAX, and RIPK1) confirmed the pharmacological data. Interestingly however, electron microscopy of fenretinide-treated cells revealed an excessive accumulation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, which were distinct from autophagosomes. Further flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy experiments suggested a hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis, leading to an accumulation of enlarged early and late endosomes. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition as well as genetic depletion of large dynamin GTPases completely abolished fenretinide-induced vesicle formation and subsequent cell death, suggesting a new form of dynamin-dependent programmed cell death. Taken together, our data identify a new form of cell death mediated through the production of ROS by fenretinide treatment, highlighting the value of this compound for treatment of sarcoma patients including FP-RMS."
"Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are a mainstay for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. However, despite advances in antithrombotic therapy, a fundamental challenge is the side effect of bleeding. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis has revealed new targets for attenuating thrombosis with the potential for less bleeding, including glycoprotein VI on platelets and factor XIa of the coagulation system. The efficacy and safety of new agents are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. This Review provides an overview of haemostasis and thrombosis, details the current landscape of antithrombotic agents, addresses challenges with preventing thromboembolic events in patients at high risk and describes the emerging therapeutic strategies that may break the inexorable link between antithrombotic therapy and bleeding risk."
"The evolution of animal behaviour is poorly understood1,2. Despite numerous correlations between interspecific divergence in behaviour and nervous system structure and function, demonstrations of the genetic basis of these behavioural differences remain rare3,4,5. Here we develop a neurogenetic model, Drosophila sechellia, a species that displays marked differences in behaviour compared to its close cousin Drosophila melanogaster6,7, which are linked to its extreme specialization on noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia)8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Using calcium imaging, we identify olfactory pathways in D. sechellia that detect volatiles emitted by the noni host. Our mutational analysis indicates roles for different olfactory receptors in long- and short-range attraction to noni, and our cross-species allele-transfer experiments demonstrate that the tuning of one of these receptors is important for species-specific host-seeking. We identify the molecular determinants of this functional change, and characterize their evolutionary origin and behavioural importance. We perform circuit tracing in the D. sechellia brain, and find that receptor adaptations are accompanied by increased sensory pooling onto interneurons as well as species-specific central projection patterns. This work reveals an accumulation of molecular, physiological and anatomical traits that are linked to behavioural divergence between species, and defines a model for investigating speciation and the evolution of the nervous system."
"Angiotensin-[1–7] (Ang-[1–7]) antagonize the actions of the renin-angiotensin-system via the Mas receptor and thereby exert renoprotective effects. Murine recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 was reported to show renoprotective effects in an experimental Alport syndrome model; however, the protective effect of direct administration of Ang-[1–7] is unknown. Here, we used Col4a3−/− mice as a model of Alport syndrome, which were treated with saline or Ang- [1–7]; saline-treated wild-type mice were used as a control group. The mice were continuously infused with saline or Ang-[1–7] (25 μg/kg/h) using osmotic mini-pumps. Col4a3−/− mice showed increased α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), collagen, and fibronectin expression levels, which were attenuated by Ang-[1–7] treatment. Moreover, Ang-[1–7] alleviated activation of transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling, and attenuated the protein expression of ED-1 and heme oxygenase-1, indicating reduction of renal inflammation. Ang-[1–7] treatment further reduced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules and attenuated apoptosis in human kidney cells. Finally, Ang-[1–7] downregulated TNF-α converting enzyme and upregulated ACE2 expression. Thus, treatment with Ang-[1–7] altered the ACE2-Ang-[1–7]-Mas receptor axis in the kidneys of Col4a3−/− mice to attenuate the nephropathy progression of Alport syndrome."
"Inflammatory mediators may have a role in various lower urinary tract disorders. Histamine is known to induce significant increases in both the tension and frequency of spontaneous phasic contractions in both urothelium with lamina propria (U&LP) and detrusor muscle via the activation of H1 receptor in juvenile animal models. However, it is unclear whether age affects these contractile responses to histamine. This study assessed the histamine receptor subtypes mediating contraction in juvenile and adult porcine bladders and compared the urothelium with lamina propria and detrusor responses to histamine. Isolated tissue bath studies were conducted using strips of porcine U&LP and detrusor obtained from juvenile (6 months) and adult (3 years) animals exposed to histamine receptor agonists and antagonists. Treatment with histamine (100 µM) in U&LP of juvenile animals caused increases in baseline tension by 47.84 ± 6.52 mN/g (p < 0.001, n = 51) and by 50.76 ± 4.10 mN/g (p < 0.001, n = 55) in adult animals. Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous phasic contractions was significantly enhanced in response to histamine in U&LP of both juvenile and adult tissues (p < 0.001 for both age groups). Treatment with an H2 agonist in U&LP of juvenile animals decreased baseline tension by 13.97 ± 3.45 mN/g (n = 12, p < 0.05), but had no effect in adult animals. Inhibition of H1 receptors resulted in significantly reduced contractile responses of U&LP and detrusor to histamine in both juvenile and adult animals (p < 0.05). Treatment with an H2 receptor antagonist significantly enhanced contractions in juvenile preparations (n = 10, p < 0.05) but had no effect in adult preparations (n = 8). In detrusor, treatment with histamine (100 µM) in juvenile tissues showed a significantly higher increase in baseline tension of 19.10 ± 4.92 mN/g (n = 51) when compared to adult tissues exhibiting increases of 8.21 ± 0.89 mN/g (n = 56, p < 0.05). The increases in the baseline tension were significantly inhibited by the presence of H1 receptor antagonists in both juvenile and adult detrusor preparations. Treatment with either the H2 receptor antagonist or agonist in detrusor had no effect on both juvenile and adult tissues. Therefore, the histamine receptor system may play an essential role in the maintenance of bladder function or in bladder dysfunction observed in some lower urinary tract disorders."
"In Japan, 1.5–2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. New direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) offer an unprecedented opportunity to cure HCV. While the price of HCV treatment decreased recently in most countries, it remains one of the highest in Japan. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in patients of different age groups and to estimate the price at which DAAs become cost-saving in Japan. A previously developed microsimulation model was adapted to the Japanese population and updated with Japan-specific health utilities and costs. Our model showed that compared with no treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DAAs at a price USD 41,046 per treatment was USD 9,080 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 60-year-old patients. HCV treatment became cost-effective after 9 years of starting treatment. However, if the price of DAAs is reduced by 55–85% (USD 6,730 to 17,720), HCV treatment would be cost-saving within a 5 to 20-year time horizon, which should serve to increase the uptake of DAA-based HCV treatment. The payers of health care in Japan could examine ways to procure DAAs at a price where they would be cost-saving."
"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) responds to 17β-estradiol via estrogen-receptor (ER, transcribed from ESR1) dependent mechanisms, but is not recognized as a hormonally responsive cancer. 17β-estradiol production by LSCC cell lines UM-SCC-11A and UM-SCC-12 was examined. Wild type (WT) and ESR1-silenced LSCC cultures and xenografts were examined for 17β-estradiol responsiveness in vivo. 14 LSCC and surrounding epithelial samples at various pathological stages were obtained from patients; ERα and ERβ expression were verified using data from the total cancer genome atlas. UM-SCC-11A and UM-SCC-12 both produce 17β-estradiol, but only UM-SCC-12, not UM-SCC-11A, xenograft tumors grow larger in vivo in response to systemic 17β-estradiol treatments. ERα66 and ERα36 expression inversely correlated with clinical cancer stage and tumor burden. LSCC ERα66 expression was higher compared to surrounding epithelia in indolent samples but lower in aggressive LSCC. ERβ expression was highly variable. High ESR1 expression correlated with improved survival in LSCC. Loss of ERα66 expression inversely correlated with prognosis in LSCC. ERα66 may be a histopathological marker of aggression in LSCC."
"Cancers are characterized by reprogrammed glucose metabolisms to fuel cell growth and proliferation. Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-mediated transcription factor that strongly regulates glycolytic and lipogenic pathways. It has been shown to associate with metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. However, how it associates with cancers has not been well understood. In this study, ChREBP expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in colon tissue arrays containing normal colon tissue and cancer tissue at different clinical stages. Tissue mRNA levels of ChREBP were also measured in a cohort of colon cancer patients. We found that ChREBP mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in colon cancer tissue compared to healthy colon (p < 0.001), and their expression was positively correlated to colon malignancy (for mRNA, p = 0.002; for protein p < 0.001). Expression of lipogenic genes (ELOVL6 and SCD1) in colon cancer was also positively associated with colon malignancy (for both genes, p < 0.001). In vitro, ChREBP knockdown with siRNA transfection inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest without changes in apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines (HT29, DLD1 and SW480). Glycolytic and lipogenic pathways were inhibited but the p53 pathway was activated after ChREBP knockdown. Taken together, ChREBP expression is associated with colon malignancy and it might contribute to cell proliferation via promoting anabolic pathways and inhibiting p53. In addition, ChREBP might represent a novel clinical useful biomarker to evaluate the malignancy of colon cancer."
"Knowledge and research results about hand osteoarthritis (hOA) are limited due to the lack of samples and animal models of the disease. Here, we report the generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-lines from patients with radiographic hOA. Furthermore, we wondered whether these iPSC-lines carried single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes that have been associated with hOA. Finally, we performed chondrogenic differentiation of the iPSCs in order to prove their usefulness as cellular models of the disease. We performed a non-integrative reprogramming of dermal fibroblasts obtained from two patients with radiographic rhizarthrosis and non-erosive hOA by introducing the transcriptional factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc using Sendai virus. After reprogramming, embryonic stem cell-like colonies emerged in culture, which fulfilled all the criteria to be considered iPSCs. Both iPSC-lines carried variants associated with hOA in the four studied genes and showed differences in their chondrogenic capacity when compared with a healthy control iPSC-line. To our knowledge this is the first time that the generation of iPSC-lines from patients with rhizarthrosis and non-erosive hOA is reported. The obtained iPSC-lines might enable us to model the disease in vitro, and to deeper study both the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying hOA."
"Osteoarthritis is an increasingly important health problem for which the main treatment remains joint replacement. Therapy developments have been hampered by a lack of biomarkers that can reliably predict disease, while 2D radiographs interpreted by human observers are still the gold standard for clinical trial imaging assessment. We propose a 3D approach using computed tomography—a fast, readily available clinical technique—that can be applied in the assessment of osteoarthritis using a new quantitative 3D analysis technique called joint space mapping (JSM). We demonstrate the application of JSM at the hip in 263 healthy older adults from the AGES-Reykjavík cohort, examining relationships between 3D joint space width, 3D joint shape, and future joint replacement. Using JSM, statistical shape modelling, and statistical parametric mapping, we show an 18% improvement in prediction of joint replacement using 3D metrics combined with radiographic Kellgren & Lawrence grade (AUC 0.86) over the existing 2D FDA-approved gold standard of minimum 2D joint space width (AUC 0.73). We also show that assessment of joint asymmetry can reveal significant differences between individuals destined for joint replacement versus controls at regions of the joint that are not captured by radiographs. This technique is immediately implementable with standard imaging technologies."
"Several factors affect gut microbiota development in early life, among which breastfeeding plays a key role. We followed 24 mother-infant pairs to investigate the associations between concentrations of selected human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in breastmilk, infant faeces, and the faecal microbiota composition in healthy, breastfed infants at two, six and 12 weeks of age. Lactation duration had a significant effect on breastmilk HMO content, which decreased with time, except for 3-fucosyllactose (3FL) and Lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFP III). We confirmed that microbiota composition was strongly influenced by infant age and was associated with mode of delivery and breastmilk LNFP III concentration at two weeks, with infant sex, delivery mode, and concentrations of 3′sialyllactose (3′SL) in milk at six weeks, and infant sex and Lacto-N-hexaose (LNH) in milk at 12 weeks of age. Correlations between levels of individual breastmilk HMOs and relative abundance of OTUs found in infant faeces, including the most predominant Bifidobacterium OTUs, were weak and varied with age. The faecal concentration of HMOs decreased with age and were strongly and negatively correlated with relative abundance of OTUs within genera Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Lachnospiraceae Incertae Sedis, and Erysipelotrichaceae Incertae Sedis, indicating the likely importance of these taxa for HMO metabolism in vivo."
"Background/objectivesThe Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy Phase 2 (CALERIE) study showed that individuals who are nonobese were able to undergo significant calorie restriction (CR), yet the time course changes in adherence, weight, and appetite are unknown. This analysis aimed to investigate the time course changes in adherence, body weight, and appetite during the CALERIE study.Subjects/methodsOverall, 143 participants (body mass index: 21.9–28.0 kg/m2) were randomized to a CR group that aimed to achieve 25% CR for 2 years. Throughout the intervention, body weight was measured, and appetite was assessed through visual analogue scales. Algorithms were utilized with body weight measurements to calculate adherence percentile score. Participants targeted an adherence percentile score of 50, though being between 80 (lowest acceptable adherence) and 10 (highest acceptable adherence) was adequate. Polynomial regression analyses were used to assess time course changes.ResultsPolynomials indicated that adherence percentile score increased above 50 after approximately week 20, although adherence remained acceptable (adherence percentile score less than 80) (R2 = 0.89; P < 0.001). Weight loss occurred until approximately week 60 and then plateaued (R2 ≥ 0.92; P < 0.001). Hunger and thirst increased (R2 ≥ 0.30; P < 0.001), but the total increase in scale scores were <10 mm throughout the intervention.ConclusionsIn individuals who are nonobese, adherence to 25% CR declines after 20 weeks, but 2 years of CR that stimulates a meaningful reduction in weight, promotes aging-related benefits and negligibly affects appetite is viable."
"MIRAGE syndrome is a recently identified disorder characterized by myelodysplasia, infection, restriction of growth, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy. It is caused by a gain-of-function variant in the SAMD9 gene, but there is limited knowledge regarding the genotype–phenotype correlation. We herein report a Japanese patient with MIRAGE syndrome carrying a novel de novo heterozygous missense variant in the SAMD9 gene (c.4435 G > T; p.Ala1479Ser)."
"This study sought to explore if the effect of 20% sucrose rinse (SR) on the salivary electrolytic concentration of calcium (Ca2+), phosphate (Pi) and fluoride (F−) in children with Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is different from healthy children. Here, fifty-eight  preschoolers aged 3 to 5 years were divided into 2 groups: caries-free (CF) and with ECC. Changes in saliva flow rate, pH and buffering capacity (BC), as well as in concentrations of Ca2+, Pi, and F−, and the degree of saturation in relation to hydroxyapatite (DSS HAp) and fluorapatite (DSS FAp) were evaluated. The pre-rinse [Ca2+] was higher in the ECC group in the CF group. A significant increase in [Ca2+] was demonstrated after SR in the CF group (p = 0.05). The [Pi] was reduced by 18% after SR in the ECC group (p = 0.007). The [F-] reduced in both groups after SR (p < 0.000). There was a moderate positive correlation between [Ca2+] and the DSS HAp and DSS FAp. Multivariate analysis showed that children with a higher [Ca2+] in pre-rinse saliva are more likely to have ECC. In conclusion, the effect of a 20% sucrose rinse on the electrolytic concentration of Ca2+, Pi and F- was different when children with ECC were compared with CF children."
"The differences in prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) by sex have been investigated in several previous studies, but the results have not been consistent. In addition, the impact of sex on the clinical and pathological characteristics, especially on central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), still remains unknown. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of sex on PTC has not been investigated in the Chinese PTC population. Therefore, our study retrospectively analysed the data of 1339 patients who were diagnosed with PTC and had received radical surgery at Ningbo Medical Center, Lihuili Hospital. In addition to cancer-specific death, structural recurrence and risk stratification, prognosis was also estimated by using three conventional prognostic systems: AMES (age, distant metastasis, extent, size), MACIS (distant metastasis, age, completeness of resection, local invasion, size) and the 8th version TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) staging system. The clinical and pathological characteristics and above prognostic indexes were compared between male and female PTC patients. The results showed that there were higher rates of non-microcarcinoma PTC (nM-PTC), CLNM, lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM), advanced disease and bilateral disease, but there was a lower rate of concurrent Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) in male PTC patients than in female PTC patients. Additionally, the rate of intermediate-risk, high-risk or advanced disease was higher in male PTC patients. The above findings indicate that PTC in men is a more aggressive disease and may have a worse prognosis; thus, it should be treated with more caution."
"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common adverse event (AE) of endoscopic papillectomy (EP). Prophylactic plastic pancreatic stent (PPS) placement appears to prevent AP. We evaluated factors associated with post-EP AP by a retrospective analysis of patients with tumors of the duodenal papilla who underwent EP from January 2008 to November 2016 at 2 tertiary care centers. Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic ultrasound parameters, and PPS placement were evaluated. Seventy-two patients underwent EP (37 men), with mean age of 60.3 (31–88) years. Mean main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter was 0.44 (0.18–1.8) cm. Mean tumor size was 1.8 (0.5–9.6) cm. Tumors were staged as uT1N0, uT2N0, and uT1N1 in 87.5%, 11.1%, and 1.4%. Thirty-eight AEs occurred in 33 (45.8%) patients, with no mortality. Total bilirubin, tumor size, MPD diameter, and PPS placement had odds ratios (ORs) of 0.82, 0.14, 0.00, and 6.43 for AP. Multivariate analysis (PPS placement × MPD diameter) showed ORs of 4.62 (95%CI, 1.03–21.32; p = 0.049) and 0.000 (95%CI, 0.00–0.74; p = 0.042) for AP. In conclusion, patients with jaundice, large tumors, and dilated MPD seem less likely to have post-EP AP. PPS placement was associated with a higher risk of AP, which may question its use."
"Study designCross-sectional.Objectives(1) Identify changes in employment status and earnings after spinal cord injury (SCI). (2) Estimate annual indirect costs and lifetime indirect costs due to lost earnings for various age and neurologic categories of those with SCI. (3) Compare our estimates with previous research.SettingMedical university in southeastern United States.MethodsA population-based cohort of 307 participants met eligibility criteria of: (1) residual impairment resulting from traumatic SCI, (2) at least 1 year post injury, (3) between 23 and 64 years old at time of injury, (4) <65 years old at time of measurement, and (5) complete information on injury level, injury completeness, employment status, and earnings before and after injury. Main outcomes were employment status and earnings at the time of injury and post injury. Earnings were adjusted for inflation and the value of fringe benefits.ResultsEmployment rate decreased from 87% at the time of injury to 35% after injury. Average annual indirect costs were $29,354 in 2019 dollars. Lifetime indirect costs for persons injured at age 25 varied by severity of injury, ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 million dollars. Lifetime indirect costs for persons injured at age 50 ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 million dollars.ConclusionsOur estimate of indirect costs is lower than the previously estimated number. However, the higher unemployment rate and decreased earnings after SCI still make a heavy economic burden. With improvements in employment outcomes after SCI, the indirect costs affecting individuals, their families, and society can be further reduced."
"This study evaluated cataracts in wild boar exposed to chronic low-dose radiation. We examined wild boar from within and outside the Fukushima Exclusion Zone for nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts in vivo and photographically. Plausible upper-bound, lifetime radiation dose for each boar was estimated from radioactivity levels in each animal’s home range combined with tissue concentrations of 134+137Cesium. Fifteen exposed and twenty control boar were evaluated. There were no significant differences in overall prevalence or score for cortical or PSC cataracts between exposed and control animals. Nuclear (centrally located) cataracts were significantly more prevalent in exposed boar (p < 0.05) and had statistically higher median scores. Plausible upper-bound, lifetime radiation dose ranged from 1 to 1,600 mGy in exposed animals, with no correlation between dose and cortical or PSC score. While radiation dose and nuclear score were positively associated, the impact of age could not be completely separated from the relationship. Additionally, the clinical significance of even the highest scoring nuclear cataract was negligible. Based on the population sampled, wild boar in the Fukushima Exclusion Zone do not have a significantly higher prevalence or risk of cortical or PSC cataracts compared to control animals."
"Obtaining reliable and high fidelity next-generation sequencing (NGS) data requires to choose a suitable sequencing platform and a library preparation approach, which both have their inherent assay-specific limitations. Here, we present the results of successful adaptation of SureSelect hybridisation-based target enrichment protocol for the sequencing on the Ion Torrent S5 platform, which is designed to work preferably with amplicon-based panels. In our study, we applied a custom NGS panel to screen a cohort of 16 unrelated patients affected by premature fusion of the cranial sutures, i.e. craniosynostosis (CS). CS occurs either as an isolated malformation or in a syndromic form, representing a genetically heterogeneous and clinically variable group of disorders. The approach presented here allowed us to achieve high quality NGS data and confirmed molecular diagnosis in 19% of cases, reaching the diagnostic yield similar to some of the published research reports. In conclusion, we demonstrated that an alternative enrichment strategy for library preparations can be successfully applied prior to sequencing on the Ion Torrent S5 platform. Also, we proved that the custom NGS panel designed by us represents a useful and effective tool in the molecular diagnostics of patients with CS."
"Currently, there are no non-invasive tools to accurately diagnose wound and surgical site infections before they become systemic or cause significant anatomical damage. Fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging are cost-effective imaging modalities that can be used to noninvasively diagnose bacterial infections when paired with a molecularly targeted infection imaging agent. Here, we develop a fluorescent derivative of maltotriose (Cy7-1-maltotriose), which is shown to be taken up in a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains in vitro. In vivo fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging studies highlight the ability of this probe to detect infection, assess infection burden, and visualize the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in E. coli-induced myositis and a clinically relevant S. aureus wound infection murine model. In addition, we show that maltotriose is an ideal scaffold for infection imaging agents encompassing better pharmacokinetic properties and in vivo stability than other maltodextrins (e.g. maltohexose)."
"Successful drug discovery is ultimately contingent on the availability of workable, relevant, predictive model systems. Conversely, for cardiac muscle, the lack of human preclinical models to inform target validation and compound development has likely contributed to the perennial problem of clinical trial failures, despite encouraging non-human results. By contrast, human cardiomyocytes produced from pluripotent stem cell models have recently been applied to safety pharmacology, phenotypic screening, target validation and high-throughput assays, facilitating cardiac drug discovery. Here, we review the impact of human pluripotent stem cell models in cardiac drug discovery, discussing the range of applications, readouts, and disease models employed, along with the challenges and prospects to advance this fruitful mode of research further."
"Concern is emerging regarding the challenges posed by spatial complexity for modelling and managing the area-wide elimination of parasitic infections. While this has led to calls for applying heterogeneity-based approaches for addressing this complexity, questions related to spatial scale, the discovery of locally-relevant models, and its interaction with options for interrupting parasite transmission remain to be resolved. We used a data-driven modelling framework applied to infection data gathered from different monitoring sites to investigate these questions in the context of understanding the transmission dynamics and efforts to eliminate Simulium neavei- transmitted onchocerciasis, a macroparasitic disease that causes river blindness in Western Uganda and other regions of Africa. We demonstrate that our Bayesian-based data-model assimilation technique is able to discover onchocerciasis models that reflect local transmission conditions reliably. Key management variables such as infection breakpoints and required durations of drug interventions for achieving elimination varied spatially due to site-specific parameter constraining; however, this spatial effect was found to operate at the larger focus level, although intriguingly including vector control overcame this variability. These results show that data-driven modelling based on spatial datasets and model-data fusing methodologies will be critical to identifying both the scale-dependent models and heterogeneity-based options required for supporting the successful elimination of S. neavei-borne onchocerciasis."
"Growing evidence indicates that a small number of cancer cells express stem cell markers and possess stem cell-like properties that promote malignant progression. Sex-determining region Y-box2 (SOX2) is a stem cell transcription factor essential for maintaining the properties of cancer stem cell (CSC). As CSC properties have been associated with angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM), we aimed to comprehensively investigate whether SOX2 regulates CSC properties, angiogenesis, and VM in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and its potential mechanism in this study. For this study, sphere formation assay, flow cytometry, cell survival analysis, tube formation, 3D culture, immunoblot, mouse model, and luciferase reporter assay were performed in vivo and in vitro. Expressions of SOX2 and miR-450a-5p in CRC tissue samples were examined through immunohistochemistry. First, the expression of SOX2 was not only associated with poor differentiation and prognosis but also promoted angiogenesis and VM. Knockdown of SOX2 ceased stemness properties, angiogenesis, and VM, along with decreased expression of CD133, CD31, and VE-cadherin as observed in functional experiments. Downregulation of SOX2 was found to inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo. Second, miR-450a-5p suppressed the expression of SOX2 by targeting its 3’UTR region directly and hence restrained SOX2-induced CSC properties, angiogenesis, and VM. Moreover, SOX2 overexpression preserved the miR-450a-5p-induced inhibition of CRC properties, angiogenesis, and VM. Finally, clinical samples exhibited a negative correlation between miR-450a-5p and SOX2. Patients with higher SOX2 and lower miR-450a-5p expressions had a poorer prognosis than patients with inverse expressions. Conclusively, we elucidated a unique mechanism of miR-450a-5p-SOX2 axis in the regulation of stemness, angiogenesis, and VM, which may act as a potential therapeutic practice in CRC."
"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study found that atypical protein kinase C-ι (aPKC-ι) promoted the EMT process in HCC. However, how the aPKC-ι signaling pathway is regulated in HCC has not been elucidated. In this study, vector transfection was utilized to study the invasion of HCC cells, and the mechanism between P300 and aPKC-ι signaling pathways in regulating the EMT process of HCC was further elucidated in vitro and in vivo. We found both P300 and aPKC-ι were highly expressed in HCC and they were correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in HCC patients. P300 knockdown inhibited EMT, invasion and other malignant events of HCC cells but promoted cell apoptosis and cycle arrest. However, the effects mediated by P300 knockdown were abolished by aPKC-ι overexpression. Further studies showed that P300 upregulates aPKC-ι expression through increasing the transcription of Elk1, a transcriptional activator of aPKC-ι, and stabilizing Elk1 protein and its phosphorylation. In conclusion, our work uncovered the molecular mechanism by which oncogenic aPKC-ι is upregulated in HCC and suggests that P300, like aPKC-ι, may be used as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in patients with HCC."
"The positive results of the apatinib phase III trial have cast new light on treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, in terms of safety, apatinib toxicities may lead to a dose modification or treatment interruption. Therefore, proper intervention is urgently needed to help patients benefit from apatinib treatment. In this study, we found that apatinib promoted autophagy activation via upregulation of ATG7 expression and autophagy inhibition enhanced apatinib-induced apoptosis. With microRNA and circular RNA-sequencing analyses of GC xenograft models, we demonstrated that circRACGAP1 functioned as an endogenous sponge for miR-3657 to inhibit its activity and further upregulate ATG7 expression. Silencing of circRACGAP1 inhibited apatinib-induced autophagy, which was rescued by miR-3657. Moreover, knockdown of circRACGAP1 sensitized GC cells to apatinib via autophagy inhibition in vitro and in vivo. These findings provided the first evidence that the circRACGAP1-miR-3657-ATG7 axis mediates a novel regulatory pathway critical for the regulation of apatinib sensitivity in GC. Thus, specific blockage of circRACGAP1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce the toxicities of apatinib and enhance its therapeutic effect in human GC."
"The genomic inter-individual heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for both clinical decision-making and the design of clinical trials. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly implemented in drug development and clinical trials, translation of the obtained genomic information into actionable clinical advice lags behind. Major reasons are the paucity of sufficiently powered trials that can quantify the added value of pharmacogenetic testing, and the considerable pharmacogenetic complexity with millions of rare variants with unclear functional consequences. The resulting uncertainty is reflected in inconsistencies of pharmacogenomic drug labels in Europe and the United States. In this review, we discuss how the knowledge gap for bridging pharmacogenomics into the clinics can be reduced. First, emerging methods that allow the high-throughput experimental characterization of pharmacogenomic variants combined with novel computational tools hold promise to improve the accuracy of drug response predictions. Second, tapping of large biobanks of therapeutic drug monitoring data allows to conduct high-powered retrospective studies that can validate the clinical importance of genetic variants, which are currently incompletely characterized. Combined, we are confident that these methods will improve the accuracy of drug response predictions and will narrow the gap between variant identification and its utilization for clinical decision-support."
"Previous studies have found that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution is associated with decreased lung function. However, most current research focuses on children with asthma, leading to small sample sizes and limited generalization of results. The current study aimed to measure the short-term and lag effects of PM2.5 among school-aged children using repeated measurements of lung function.This prospective panel study included 848 schoolchildren in Zhejiang Province, China. Each year from 2014–2017, two lung function tests were conducted from November 15th to December 31st. Daily air pollution data were derived from the monitoring stations nearest to the schools. A mixed-effects regression model was used to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 and lung function. The effect of PM2.5 on lung function reached its greatest at 1-day moving average PM2.5 exposure. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in the 1-day moving average PM2.5 concentration, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of children decreased by 33.74 mL (95% CI: 22.52, 44.96), 1-s Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) decreased by 32.56 mL (95% CI: 21.41, 43.70), and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) decreased by 67.45 mL/s (95% CI: 45.64, 89.25). Stronger associations were found in children living in homes with smokers. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with reductions in schoolchildren’s lung function. This finding indicates that short-term exposure to PM2.5 is harmful to children’s respiratory health, and appropriate protective measures should be taken to reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on children’s health."
"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a revolutionary method in the visualization of the vascular system in different retinal and choroidal layers. During the last 4 years since the commercial availability of different OCTA devices, attempts have been made to utilize this technology in various aspects of ocular oncology from the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions to assisting in evaluation of post-treatment complications, such as radiation retinopathy. However, current OCTA technology is restricted by various artefacts and inherent limitations, some of which are more pronounced in the presence of elevated tumoural lesions. Imminent advancements in OCTA systems and image acquisition processes promise a great potential for application of OCTA in ocular oncology."
"Clear corneal incision (CCI) is a commonly used surgical approach in cataract surgery. In this prospective study, we evaluated the effect of CCI site on surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) and other postoperative astigmatic changes. CCIs were constructed based on the steep meridian of the total corneal refractive power in the 4.0-mm-zone (TCRP4.0), and patients were divided into four groups: temporal, superotemporal, superonasal, and superior according to the site of the incision. TCRP4.0 analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of astigmatism with superior incisions (P < 0.001), and the combined mean polar values for SIA changed significantly in the temporal (Hotelling T2 = 1.977), superotemporal (Hotelling T2 = 0.544), superonsal (Hotelling T2 = 1.066), and superior incision groups (Hotelling T2 = 1.134) (all P < 0.001). The posterior axis alignment should be considered in cataract surgery with CCI, and the SIA is affected by axis rotation, and incision orientation."
"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic degenerative disease of the retina. Recent reports have highlighted the potential role of mucosal surface microbes in the pathogenesis of AMD. In this case-control study, the composition of the nasal and oral microbiota in newly diagnosed neovascular age-related macular degeneration cases (6 male, 7 female) was compared to controls without retinal diseases (2 male, 3 female). PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed with universal primers amplifying the V4 variable region (515F-806R). Distinct microbial community characterization was achieved using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis index with comparative analysis between cases and controls performed within QIIME 2. Sequencing of all cases and controls revealed clear separation with strong beta diversity between oral and nasal microbial communities (p < 0.001). Microbial composition differed between cases and controls in both oral and nasal samples. The top three oral microbes identified as different compared to controls included Burkholderiales (7.41 log2fold change, p = 3.29E-05), Actinomyceataceae (6.22 log2fold change, p = 3.73E-06) and Gemella (5.28 log2fold change, p = 0.0002). The top three nasal microbes identified as different compared to controls included Rothia (13.6 log2fold change, p =  3.63E-18), Actinobacteria (10.29 log2fold change, p = 9.81E-10) and Propionibacteriales (8.73 log2fold change, p = 6.74E-09). These relative shifts in communities of bacteria detected in newly diagnosed neovascular AMD patients may suggest additional mechanistic links in disease pathogenesis."
"Endoscopic resection techniques, such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), are frequently aided by injection of submucosal lifting solutions that create a plane for dissection and protect deeper mural layers. ORISE™ gel is a recently approved synthetic lifting solution that produces a localized inflammatory reaction associated with retained gel at the injection site. We describe a series of six cases of ORISE™-associated inflammatory lesions in patients who underwent endoscopic resections. Deposits comprised pale fibrillary or hyalinized eosinophilic material, depending on their age. All cases were associated with an inflammatory reaction composed of foreign-body giant cells and scattered eosinophils. ORISE™ gel extended laterally and deeply beyond residual tumors in all cases. Histochemically, the material proved to be negative for Congo Red, and mucicarmine, faint blue with Alcian blue, but positive for PAS and PAS-D. It stained blue with trichrome. Such deposits were absent in cases, wherein other widely-available lifting solutions were used. We compared ORISE™ deposits to histologically similar extracellular deposits, namely amyloid and pulse granulomata. Unlike ORISE™ material, amyloid deposits appear as waxy, more densely eosinophilic material, and stain positive with Congo Red. Amyloid demonstrated prominent intramucosal and perivascular distributions, features not seen in this series of ORISE™ deposits. Hyalinized pulse granulomata showed strong overlap with ORISE™ deposits, since they also comprise eosinophilic material associated with giant cell reaction. On the other hand, they form ribbons of glassy material in circumscribed lobules, unlike the ill-defined ORISE™ deposits. In summary, we describe the pathologic findings at injection sites in patients who underwent endoscopic procedures aided by the recently approved lifting agent, ORISE™. Pathologists should be aware of its appearance and associated reaction to avoid confusion with other common extracellular deposits seen in the gastrointestinal tract."
"We report a rare case of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) in a 35-year-old woman with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Initially, the disease manifested as passivity, a loss of interest, sleeping too much, apathy and disorientation. The correct diagnosis was established after the detection of typical pathological findings of WE in the thalamus by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was indicated for the appearance of eye symptomatology in the form of nystagmus. Subsequent treatment with thiamine led to rapid improvement in the patient’s clinical status and a favorable course of pregnancy."
"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprises a diverse group of malignancies arising from the nephron. The most prevalent type, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), is characterized by genetic mutations in factors governing the hypoxia signaling pathway, resulting in metabolic dysregulation, heightened angiogenesis, intratumoral heterogeneity, and deleterious tumor microenvironmental (TME) crosstalk. Identification of specific genetic variances has led to therapeutic innovation and improved survival for patients with ccRCC. Current barriers to effective long-term therapeutic success highlight the need for continued drug development using improved modeling systems. ccRCC preclinical models can be grouped into three broad categories: cell line, mouse, and 3D models. Yet, the breadth of important unanswered questions in ccRCC research far exceeds the accessibility of model systems capable of carrying them out. Accordingly, we review the strengths, weaknesses, and therapeutic implications of each model system that are relied upon today."
"The objective of this study was to determine if 15 weeks of resistance training (RT) can alter the levels of blood lipids, body iron status, and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Postmenopausal women enrolled in a randomised controlled trial were allocated to either a sedentary control group (n = 29) or a RT group (n = 26). Blood samples were taken at week-0 and week-15 for all participants. Blood lipids and iron status were measured via routine clinical analyses. Immunoassays were used to measure oxidative stress markers. The RT group, with good compliance, was associated with significant reductions in ferritin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, ferritin was positively correlated with atherogenic lipids while negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein in RT women. This occurred without alterations in serum iron, transferrin, transferrin-saturation, C-reactive protein and oxidative stress markers. No differences were found in control women. This study suggests that RT in postmenopausal women both reduces levels of ferritin and counteracts atherogenic lipid profiles independent of an apparent oxidative mechanism. RT may be a beneficial intervention in postmenopausal women via an interaction between ferritin and lipids; however, further investigation in a larger cohort is essential."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its current status is unclear. We aimed to investigate the evolution of etiology, presentation, management and prognostic tool in HCC over the past 12 years. A total of 3349 newly diagnosed HCC patients were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. The comparison of survival was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Hepatitis B and C virus infection in HCC were continuously declining over the three time periods (2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015; p < 0.001). At diagnosis, single tumor detection rate increased to 73% (p < 0.001), whereas vascular invasion gradually decreased to 20% in 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). Early stage HCC gradually increased from 2004–2007 to 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). The probability of patients receiving curative treatment and long-term survival increased from 2004–2007 to 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). The Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Taipei Integrated Scoring (TIS) system were two more accurate staging systems among all. In conclusion, the clinical presentations of HCC have significantly changed over the past 12 years. Hepatitis B and C virus-associated HCC became less common, and more patients were diagnosed at early cancer stage. Patient survival increased due to early cancer detection that results in increased probability to undergo curative therapies."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more prevalent in males than in females, but the neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to this sex-bias are poorly understood. The female protective hypothesis suggests that the manifestation of ASD in females requires higher cumulative genetic and environmental risk relative to males. Here, we test this hypothesis by assessing the additive impact of several ASD-associated OXTR variants on reward network resting-state functional connectivity in males and females with and without ASD, and explore how genotype, sex, and diagnosis relate to heterogeneity in neuroendophenotypes. Females with ASD who carried a greater number of ASD-associated risk alleles in the OXTR gene showed greater functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; hub of the reward network) and subcortical brain areas important for motor learning. Relative to males with ASD, females with ASD and higher OXTR risk-allele-dosage showed increased connectivity between the NAcc, subcortical regions, and prefrontal brain areas involved in mentalizing. This increased connectivity between NAcc and prefrontal cortex mirrored the relationship between genetic risk and brain connectivity observed in neurotypical males showing that, under increased OXTR genetic risk load, females with ASD and neurotypical males displayed increased connectivity between reward-related brain regions and prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that females with ASD differentially modulate the effects of increased genetic risk on brain connectivity relative to males with ASD, providing new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms through which the female protective effect may manifest."
"The advent of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has posed several significant difficulties for the secondary research uses of data and associated biospecimens and has led to widespread unease within the international biobanking and databanking community. This disruption of research using personal data and associated biospecimens has gone largely unremarked in the professional literature, including in a recent account of GDPR’s relationship to biobanking practices published in this journal, which instead advocated even more stringent, and in our view, unnecessary restrictions on research uses of banked data and materials. In this article, we describe challenges that GDPR has posed for biobanks and databanks and for researchers who use those banked resources for secondary research. We discuss the limitations inherent in the few pathways that GDPR makes available for secondary research, given that such pathways rely upon complex and varied laws of individual European Union member states. We advocate mitigation of these difficulties through regulatory guidance in order to allow important scientific research to continue."
"Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma is one of the highest mortality factors in the world due to the lack of potential biomarker for early detection of disease. There is an urgent need for molecular marker involved in disease progression which remains suppressed normally, required for specificity. HLA-G is highly expressed in cancers and creates immune-suppressive microenvironment. Cancerous cells secrete inflammatory cytokines like IL-10,IFN-γ which increase expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as HLA-G. We evaluated sHLA-G protein level in serum of 120 HNSCC patients at diagnosis and after therapy and compared with 99 individuals by SPR, ELISA and determined its mRNA level by qRT-PCR. sHLA-G was correlated with serum IL-10 and IFN-γ of the patients. Significant elevated levels of sHLA-G were observed in patients (8.25 ± 1.74 ng/µl) than control (6.45 ± 1.31 ng/µl). Levels were declined in (8.09 ± 1.79 ng/µl to 6.64 ± 1.33 ng/µl) patients in response to therapy. sHLA-G levels with tumor burden (8.16 ± 1.91 to 6.63 ± 1.32 ng/µl), node (8.62 ± 1.45 to 6.66 ± 1.26 ng/µl), PDSCC (8.14 ± 0.62 to 5.65 ± 0.27 ng/µl) and oropharynx (7.90 ± 1.24 to 6.10 ± 1.33 ng/µl) showed a positive and significant response to therapy. Findings indicate that sHLA-G can be a potential diagnostic serum protein marker for HNSCC due to its suppressive function and over expression in diseased condition with the influence of cytokines."
"ZBTB7A is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21) translocation. However, the oncogenic collaboration between mutated ZBTB7A and the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 fusion gene in AML t(8;21) remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of ZBTB7A and its mutations in the context of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that clinically relevant ZBTB7A mutations in AML t(8;21) lead to loss of function and result in perturbed myeloid differentiation with block of the granulocytic lineage in favor of monocytic commitment. In addition, loss of ZBTB7A increases glycolysis and hence sensitizes leukemic blasts to metabolic inhibition with 2-deoxy-d-glucose. We observed that ectopic expression of wild-type ZBTB7A prevents RUNX1-RUNX1T1-mediated clonal expansion of human CD34+ cells, whereas the outgrowth of progenitors is enabled by ZBTB7A mutation. Finally, ZBTB7A expression in t(8;21) cells lead to a cell cycle arrest that could be mimicked by inhibition of glycolysis. Our findings suggest that loss of ZBTB7A may facilitate the onset of AML t(8;21), and that RUNX1-RUNX1T1-rearranged leukemia might be treated with glycolytic inhibitors."
"Neurons in the visual cortex sharpen their orientation tuning as humans learn aversive contingencies. A stimulus orientation (CS+) that reliably predicts an aversive noise (unconditioned stimulus: US) is selectively enhanced in lower-tier visual cortex, while similar unpaired orientations (CS−) are inhibited. Here, we examine in male volunteers how sharpened visual processing is affected by fear extinction learning (where no US is presented), and how fear and extinction memory undergo consolidation one day after the original learning episode. Using steady-state visually evoked potentials from electroencephalography in a fear generalization task, we found that extinction learning prompted rapid changes in orientation tuning: Both conditioned visuocortical and skin conductance responses to the CS+ were strongly reduced. Next-day re-testing (delayed recall) revealed a brief but precise return-of-tuning to the CS+ in visual cortex accompanied by a brief, more generalized return-of-fear in skin conductance. Explorative analyses also showed persistent tuning to the threat cue in higher visual areas, 24 h after successful extinction, outlasting peripheral responding. Together, experience-based changes in the sensitivity of visual neurons show response patterns consistent with memory consolidation and spontaneous recovery, the hallmarks of long-term neural plasticity."
"We assessed differences in mitochondrial function in gluteal (gSAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT) at baseline and in response to 12-weeks of exercise training; and examined depot-specific associations with body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity (SI). Obese, black South African women (n = 45) were randomized into exercise (n = 23) or control (n = 22) groups. Exercise group completed 12-weeks of aerobic and resistance training (n = 20), while the control group (n = 15) continued usual behaviours. Mitochondrial function (high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry) in gSAT and aSAT, SI (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and ectopic fat (MRI) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, gSAT had higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production than aSAT (p < 0.05). Higher gSAT respiration was associated with higher gynoid fat (p < 0.05). Higher gSAT H2O2 production and lower aSAT mitochondrial respiration were independently associated with lower SI (p < 0.05). In response to training, SI improved and gynoid fat decreased (p < 0.05), while H2O2 production reduced in both depots, and mtDNA decreased in gSAT (p < 0.05). Mitochondrial respiration increased in aSAT and correlated with a decrease in body fat and an increase in soleus and hepatic fat content (p < 0.05). This study highlights the importance of understanding the differences in mitochondrial function in multiple SAT depots when investigating the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and associated risk factors such as body fat distribution and ectopic lipid deposition. Furthermore, we highlight the benefits of exercise training in stimulating positive adaptations in mitochondrial function in gluteal and abdominal SAT depots."
"Although hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infections are still global health issues, measuring sero-markers by standard venipuncture is challenging in areas limited with the adequate human resources and basic infrastructure. This study aimed to inform the usefulness of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling technique for epidemiological study of HBV and HCV in the resources limited areas. We compared specimen recovery rate expressed as analytical sensitivity ratio of HBsAg, HBcAb and anti-HCV between serum specimens and DBS samples (HemaSpot vs Whatman903). Sensitivity ratio was calculated as the ratio of the measured value from DBS to the measured value from serum. Then both the qualitative and quantitative comparisons of HBsAg detection by DBS were done using Cambodian samples. HBsAg, HBcAb and anti-HCV sensitivity ratios for the highest sample dilution (8-fold) were 31.2:1, 38.9:1 and 32.0:1 for Whatman903 card and 17.6:1, 23.5:1 and 26.3:1 for HemaSpot respectively. Detection efficacy of HemaSpot (80%) was not inferior to Whatman903 (60%) after 1 month storage, and no significant difference in any hepatitis virus sero-markers was observed in HemaSpot-spotted patient samples stored for 2 weeks at −25 °C and 29 °C. All reference HemaSpot -spotted 400 HBsAg sero-negative samples showed negative. Sensitivity and specificity of HBsAg in HemaSpot were 92.3% and 100%. The recovery expressed as analytical sensitivity ratio of HBsAg, HBcAb and anti-HCV of HemaSpot specimen were not inferior to Whatman903. Therefore, DBS with its usefulness proved as an acceptable tool for large epidemiological study of HBV and HCV in resources limited remote area."
"PRK1 and PRK2 are two closely related AGC-family serine/threonine protein kinases. Here we demonstrate novel roles for them at cilia and in cancer biology. In both instances serum withdrawal leads to increased activating PRK1 and PRK2 phosphorylation (pPRK1/pPRK2) and their depletion results in reduced spheroid growth. pPRK1/pPRK2 localise to the transition zone of cilia and their co-depletion results in reduced cilia size, impaired planer polarity and impaired cilia associated signalling. High PRK2 (but not PRK1) expression correlates with poor outcome in patients with basal-like/Triple Negative (TN) Breast Cancer (BC) where there is also higher expression relative to other BC tumour subtypes. In agreement, depletion of PRK1 and PRK2 in mouse TNBC cells, or CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion of PRK2 alone, significantly reduces cell proliferation and spheroid growth. Finally proteomic analysis to identify PRK2 binding partners in mouse TNBC cells revealed proteins that are important for both cilia and BC biology. Taken together these data demonstrate novel roles for PRK1 and PRK2 at cilia and in BC biology and in the case of PRK2 in particular, identifies it as a novel TNBC therapeutic target."
"The recent success of gene therapy across multiple clinical trials has inspired a great deal of hope regarding the treatment of previously intractable genetic diseases. This optimism has been extended to the prospect of gene therapy for mitochondrial disorders, which are not only particularly severe but also difficult to treat. However, this hope must be tempered by the reality of the mitochondrial organelle, which possesses specific biological properties that complicate genetic manipulation. In this perspective, we will discuss some of these complicating factors, including the unique pathways used to express and import mitochondrial proteins. We will also present some ways in which these challenges can be overcome by genetic manipulation strategies tailored specifically for mitochondrial diseases."
"The sex difference in cancer occurrence is a consistent finding in cancer epidemiology. Several solid tumors, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic carcinoma, and renal carcinoma, are generally more common in males. Although sexual dimorphism is attributed to hormonal or behavioral differences, evidence for the function of lncRNA is lacking in sex-specific cancers. We show here that LINC00263 is one of the most dysregulated lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinomas and is upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and renal carcinoma, especially in male patients compared to females. LINC00263 functions as an oncogene by promoting translocation of p65 into the nucleus to activate the NF-κB-signaling pathway through interaction with IKKα in the cytoplasm. The expression of LINC00263 is strongly correlated with ESR1, and it is decreased after treatment with estrogen. Ligand-activated ER could inhibit the function of LINC00263 by inhibiting NF-κB from cytoplasmic translocation into the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of estrogen on LINC00263 indicates its differential expression in male and female patients. Our findings indicate that LINC00263 is linked to male sex and estrogen as an oncogene, and these findings might help in the exploration of the mechanisms of differential gene regulation in sex-specific cancers."
"Only sparse epidemiological data are available regarding the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Here we aimed to describe the incidence and predictors of IS associated with CABG performed after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as well as trends over time. We analyzed data for 248,925 unselected AMI patients. We separately analyzed groups of patients who underwent CABG early or late after the index infarction. IS incidence rates per year at risk were 15.8% (95% confidence interval, 14.5–17.1) and 10.9% (10.6–11.2), respectively, among patients with and without CABG in the early cohort, and 4.0% (3.5–4.5) and 2.3% (2.2–2.3), respectively, among patients with and without CABG in the late cohort. Predictors of post-AMI IS included prior IS, CABG, prior atrial fibrillation, prior hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure during hospitalization, older age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Reduced IS risk was associated with use of statins and P2Y12 inhibitors. IS incidence markedly decreased among patients who did not undergo CABG, while no such reduction over time occurred among those who underwent CABG. This emphasizes the need to optimize modifiable risk factors and to consistently use treatments that may reduce IS risk among CABG patients."
"The reliability of radiomics features (RFs) is crucial for quantifying tumour heterogeneity. We assessed the influence of imaging, segmentation, and processing conditions (quantization range, bin number, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], and unintended outliers) on RF measurement. Low SNR and unintended outliers increased the standard deviation and mean values of histograms to calculate the first-order RFs. Variations in imaging processing conditions significantly altered the shape of the probability distribution (centre of distribution, extent of dispersion, and segmentation of probability clusters) in second-order RF matrices (i.e. grey-level co-occurrence and grey-level run length), thereby eventually causing fluctuations in RF estimation. Inconsistent imaging and processing conditions decreased the number of reliably measured RFs in terms of individual RF values (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥0.75) and inter-lesion RF ratios (coefficient of variation <15%). No RF could be reliably estimated under inconsistent SNR and inclusion of outlier conditions. By contrast, with high SNR and no outliers, all first-order RFs, 11 (42%) grey-level co-occurrence RFs and five (42%) grey-level run length RFs showed acceptable reliability. Our study suggests that optimization of SNR, exclusion of outliers, and application of relevant quantization range and bin number should be performed to ensure the robustness of radiomics studies assessing tumor heterogeneity."
"Hereditary distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a rare disease of H+ excretion defect of α-intercalated cells in renal collecting duct, caused by decreased V-ATPase function due to mutations in the ATP6V1B1 or ATP6V0A4 genes. In the present study, a genetic family with 5 members of the complete dRTA phenotype were found with distal tubule H+ secretion disorder, hypokalemia, osteoporosis, and kidney stones. A variant NM_020632.2:c.1631C > T (p.Ser544Leu) in exon 16 on an ATP6V0A4 gene associated with dRTA was detected by next generation sequencing target region capture technique and verified by Sanger sequencing, which suggested that except for one of the patients who did not receive the test, the other four patients all carried the p.S544L heterozygote. In transfected HEK293T cells, cells carrying p.S544L-mut showed early weaker ATPase activity and a slower Phi recovery rate after rapid acidification. By immunofluorescence localization, it was observed that the expression level of p.S544L-mut on the cell membrane increased and the distribution was uneven. Co-immunoprecipitation showed the a4 subunit of ATP6V0A4/p.S544L-mut could not bind to the B1 subunit, which might affect the correct assembly of V-ATPase. The present study of dRTA family suggests that the p.S544L variant may be inherited in a dominant manner."
"The pathogenesis of malignant brain tumors (MBTs) should be better understood due to the evident association between prolonged exposure to metals and increased risk of MBTs. The present research aimed to find trace metals that could contribute to the pathogenesis of MBTs. Essential trace elements (Mn, Co, Zn, Cu, Se) and relevant toxic metals (Al, Ni, As, Sr, Cd, Ce, Pt, Pb, U) in the serum, cell fraction (CF), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cancerous tissue (CT) samples of MBT patients were analyzed. The results were compared with sex- and age-matched control groups. For the first time, this research showed that elemental profiles of serum, CF, CSF and CT samples in MBT patients were significantly altered compared to the appropriate controls, as well as that higher contents of trace elements (particularly Mn, Se, and Pb) could be involved in the pathogenesis of MBTs. However, the most noticeable change found was the elevated U content, indicating its considerable role as a major cerebral discriminator of the presence/absence of MBTs. The U/Se ratio could be considered as an appropriate blood marker in diagnostic MBT evaluation. The reported results could contribute to better understanding of the poorly understood pathogenesis of MBTs. Furthermore, the reported results could highlight a molecular basis for the pathophysiological changes caused by the hazardous effects of trace metals on brain homeostasis."
"Social stress contributes to major societal health burdens, such as anxiety disorders and nervousness. Nx4 has been found to modulate stress responses. We investigated whether dampening of such responses is associated with neuronal correlates in brain regions involved in stress and anxiety. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial, 39 healthy males took a single dose (three tablets) of either placebo or Nx4, 40 to 60 minutes before an fMRI scan session. We here report on drug effects on amygdala responses during a face-matching task, which was performed during a complex test battery further including resting-state brain connectivity and a social stress experiment. The first of the Primary Outcomes, defined in a hierarchical order, concerned reduced amygdala effects after intake of verum compared to placebo. We found a statistically significant reduction in differential activations in the left amygdala for the contrast negative faces versus forms during verum versus placebo condition. Our results indicate that effects of Nx4 can be monitored in the brain. Previously noted effects on stress responses may thus be modulated by affective brain regions including the amygdala."
"Background/objectivesThe thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is generally activated in winter and tightly regulated through various metabolic processes. However, the mechanisms mediating these changes have not been elucidated in humans. Here, we investigated the relationships between BAT density (BAT-d) and lipid metabolites in plasma from men and women in the winter and summer.Subjects/methodsIn total, 92 plasma samples were obtained from 23 men and 23 women, aged 21–55 years, on two different occasions (summer and winter). Lipid metabolites were comprehensively quantified using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. BAT-d was evaluated by measuring total hemoglobin concentrations in the supraclavicular region using near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy. Anthropometric parameters, such as the percentage of whole body fat and visceral fat area (VFA), were evaluated. Factors influencing BAT-d were investigated by univariate and multivariate regression analyses.ResultsA variety of metabolite peaks, such as glycerophospholipids (168 peaks), steroids and derivatives (78 peaks), fatty acyls (62 peaks), and glycerolipids (31 peaks), were detected. Univariate regression analysis, corrected by false discovery rate to yield Q values, revealed significant correlations in BAT-d and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE(46:2), r = 0.62, Q = 4.9 × 10−2) in the summer, androgens (r = 0.75, Q = 7.0 × 10−3) in the winter, and diacylglycerol (DG(36:1), r = −0.68, Q = 4.9 × 10−2) in the summer in men, but not in women. Multivariate regression analysis in the winter revealed a significant correlation between BAT-d and plasma androgens (P = 5.3 × 10−5) in men and between BAT-d and VFA (P = 2.2 × 10−3) in women.ConclusionsCertain lipids in plasma showed unique correlations with BAT-d depending on sex and season. BAT-d showed a specific correlation with plasma androgens in men in the winter."
"The concept of substrate inhibition to prevent its phosphorylation has potential in drug discovery and is envisioned to treat the autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis (MS). Glia maturation factor-β (GMF-β) Ser83 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) is pivotal in the activation of GMF-β-p38MAPK-NFκB biochemical pathway towards proinflammatory response induction in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using structure-based drug design, we identified the small molecule inhibitor 1-H-indazole-4yl methanol (GMFBI.1) that specifically blocked Ser83 phosphorylation site on GMF-β substrate. Using in vitro and in vivo techniques, molecular mechanism of action of GMFBI.1’s direct interaction with GMF-β substrate and prevention of its Ser83 phosphorylation was established. GMFBI.1 down regulated p38MAPK phosphorylation and NFκB expression essential for proinflammatory response. Further, GMFBI.1 administration at peak of EAE reversed clinical symptoms, immunopathology, proinflammatory cytokine response and up regulated the anti-inflammatory cytokines. Present strategy of substrate inhibition against the key immunomodulatory target has immense therapeutic potential in MS."
"Although self-rated health (SRH), a subjective measure of overall health status, associates with metabolic abnormalities, studies on the relationship between SRH and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, are limited. In this study, we evaluated whether or not SRH predicts the risk of incident NAFLD. This cohort study was performed in a sample of 148,313 Korean adults free of ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD at baseline with annual or biennial follow-up for a median of 3.7 years. SRH and NAFLD were measured at baseline and follow-up visits. NAFLD was determined based on the ultrasound-diagnosed fatty liver without excessive alcohol consumption or any other cause. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated via a parametric proportional hazards model. During 522,696.1 person-years of follow-up, 23,855 individuals with new-onset NAFLD were identified (incidence rate, 45.6 per 1,000 person-years). After adjustments for possible confounders including total calorie intake, sleep duration, and depressive symptoms, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident NAFLD comparing good, fair, and poor or very poor SRH to very good SRH were 1.06 (0.97–1.14), 1.18 (1.09–1.27), and 1.24 (1.13–1.37), respectively. This association of SRH with incident NAFLD remained significant after accounting for changes in SRH and confounders during follow-up and was similar across clinically relevant subgroups. In a large-scale cohort study of apparently healthy Korean adults, poor SRH was independently and positively associated with incident NAFLD risk, indicating a predictive role of SRH as a health measure in NAFLD."
"Amplification of the MYCN oncogene occurs in ~25% of primary neuroblastomas and is the single most powerful biological marker of poor prognosis in this disease. MYCN transcriptionally regulates a range of biological processes important for cancer, including cell metabolism. The MYCN-regulated metabolic gene SLC16A1, encoding the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), is a potential therapeutic target. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the MCT1 inhibitor SR13800 increased intracellular lactate levels, disrupted the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD+) ratio, and decreased intracellular glutathione levels. Metabolite tracing with 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine following MCT1 inhibitor treatment revealed increased quantities of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and increased oxygen consumption rate. MCT1 inhibition was highly synergistic with vincristine and LDHA inhibition under cell culture conditions, but this combination was ineffective against neuroblastoma xenografts. Posttreatment xenograft tumors had increased synthesis of the MCT1 homolog MCT4/SLC16A, a known resistance factor to MCT1 inhibition. We found that MCT4 was negatively regulated by MYCN in luciferase reporter assays and its synthesis in neuroblastoma cells was increased under hypoxic conditions and following hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1) induction, suggesting that MCT4 may contribute to resistance to MCT1 inhibitor treatment in hypoxic neuroblastoma tumors. Co-treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of MCT1 and LDHA, the enzyme responsible for lactate production, resulted in a large increase in intracellular pyruvate and was highly synergistic in decreasing neuroblastoma cell viability. These results highlight the potential of targeting MCT1 in neuroblastoma in conjunction with strategies that involve disruption of pyruvate homeostasis and indicate possible resistance mechanisms."
"Resveratrol was reported to inhibit inflammatory responses; however, the role of this polyphenol in obesity-induced skeletal muscle inflammation remains unknown. Mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were treated with resveratrol for 16 weeks. Resveratrol treatment decreased macrophage infiltration into skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. Resveratrol also led to the polarization of macrophages to the M2 direction, as well as decreasing the expression of a number of M1 pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)]. In addition, increased infiltration of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) was found following resveratrol treatment in skeletal muscle of mice. Decreased intramyocellular lipid deposition was associated with reduced expression levels of toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 in resveratrol treated mice. We also found that diminished inflammation in skeletal muscle following resveratrol treatment was accompanied by increasing phosphorylation of 5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and decreasing phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Taken together, these findings suggest that resveratrol ameliorates inflammation in skeletal muscle of HFD-induced model of obesity. Therefore, resveratrol might represent a potential treatment for attenuation of inflammation in skeletal muscle tissue."
"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are activated by microbial riboflavin-based metabolite antigens when presented by MR1. How modifications to the potent antigen 5-OP-RU affect presentation by MR1 and MAIT cell activation remains unclear. Here we design 20 derivatives, termed altered metabolite ligands (AMLs), to dissect the impact of different antigen components on the human MAIT–MR1 axis. Analysis of 11 crystal structures of MAIT T cell antigen receptor (TCR)–MR1–AML ternary complexes, along with biochemical and functional assays, shows that MR1 cell-surface upregulation is influenced by ribityl and non-ribityl components of the ligand and the hydrophobicity of the MR1–AML interface. The polar ribityl chain of the AML strongly influences MAIT cell activation potency through dynamic compensatory interactions within a MAIT TCR–MR1–AML interaction triad. We define the basis by which the MAIT TCR can differentially recognize AMLs, thereby providing insight into MAIT cell antigen specificity and potency."
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, causes behavioural abnormalities such as disinhibition, impulsivity, and hyperphagia. Preclinical studies using AD model mice have investigated these phenotypes by measuring brain activity in awake, behaving mice. In this study, we monitored the behavioural alterations of impulsivity and hyperphagia in middle-aged AD model mice. As a behavioural readout, we trained the mice to accept a water-reward under thirsty conditions. To analyse brain activity, we developed a measure for licking behaviour combined with visualisation of whole brain activity using awake fMRI. In a water-reward learning task, the AD model mice showed significant hyperactivity of the dorsal raphe nucleus in thirsty conditions. In summary, we successfully visualised altered brain activity in AD model mice during reward-oriented behaviour for the first time using awake fMRI. This may help in understanding the causes of behavioural alterations in AD patients."
"While the use of social media and online-communication applications has become an integral part of everyday life, some individuals suffer from an excessive, uncontrolled use of social media despite experiencing negative consequences. In accordance with neuropsychological models of addiction, we assume the tendency of a social-networks-use disorder to be related to an interplay of predisposing personality traits (e.g., impulsivity), and reductions in cognitive functions (e.g., executive functions, inhibitory control). The current study makes first strides towards examining this interplay. In addition to a newly developed social-networks-specific auditory Go-NoGo paradigm, other neuropsychological paradigms were used. Impulsivity and social-networks-use-disorder symptoms were assessed by standardized questionnaires. The results show that the symptom severity of a social-networks-use disorder is mainly associated with attentional impulsivity. General executive functions and specific inhibitory control of social-networks-related cues have no direct effect on symptom severity. However, moderated regression analyses emphasize that increased symptom severity is associated with higher attentional impulsivity, especially if there are additionally reductions in executive functions or specific inhibitory control. The results complement previous findings and inform future research on social-networks-use disorder. The findings support the applicability of theoretical models of addictive behaviors to the social-networks-use disorder and point to social-networks-related specificities regarding attention-related facets."
"Zoonotic Salmonella causes millions of human salmonellosis infections worldwide each year. Information about the source of the bacteria guides risk managers on control and preventive strategies. Source attribution is the effort to quantify the number of sporadic human cases of a specific illness to specific sources and animal reservoirs. Source attribution methods for Salmonella have so far been based on traditional wet-lab typing methods. With the change to whole genome sequencing there is a need to develop new methods for source attribution based on sequencing data. Four European datasets collected in Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), the United Kingdom (UK) and France (FR) are presented in this descriptor. The datasets contain sequenced samples of Salmonella Typhimurium and its monophasic variants isolated from human, food, animal and the environment. The objective of the datasets was either to attribute the human salmonellosis cases to animal reservoirs or to investigate contamination of the environment by attributing the environmental isolates to different animal reservoirs."
"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, is characterized by an excessive degree of iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Although it was originally identified only in cells expressing a mutant RAS oncogene, ferroptosis has also been found in normal cells following treatment by small molecules (e.g., erastin and RSL3) or drugs (e.g., sulfasalazine, sorafenib, and artesunate), which target antioxidant enzyme systems, especially the amino acid antiporter system xc− and the glutathione peroxidase GPX4. Dysfunctional ferroptosis is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes (e.g., metabolism, differentiation, and immunity). Targeting the ferroptotic network appears to a new treatment option for diseases or pathological conditions (e.g., cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia reperfusion injury). While the molecular machinery of ferroptosis remains largely unknown, several transcription factors (e.g., TP53, NFE2L2/NRF2, ATF3, ATF4, YAP1, TAZ, TFAP2C, SP1, HIF1A, EPAS1/HIF2A, BACH1, TFEB, JUN, HIC1, and HNF4A) play multiple roles in shaping ferroptosis sensitivity through either transcription-dependent or transcription-independent mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the transcriptional regulation underlying ferroptotic cell death, and discuss how it has provided new insights into cancer therapy."
"In the context of comparative oncology, melanoma cells derived from companion animal tumors are good models for optimizing and predicting their in vivo response to therapeutic strategies. Here, we report that human, canine, and feline melanoma cells driven to death by bleomycin, interferon-β gene, or herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir suicide gene (SG) treatment significantly increased their internal granularity. This fact correlated with the release of a heterogeneous collection of nano- and micro-sized granules as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. While killing lipofected cells, the expressed transgenes and their derived products were incorporated into these granules that were isolated by differential centrifugation. These particulate factors (PFs) were able to transfer, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, appreciable levels of therapeutic genes, related proteins, and drugs. Thus, when recipient cells of SG-carrying PFs were exposed to ganciclovir, this prodrug was efficiently activated, eliminating them. These PFs kept the functionality of their cargo, even after being subjected to adverse conditions, such as the presence of DNase, freezing, or heating. Since our in vitro system did not include any of the immune mechanisms that could provide additional antitumor activity, the chemo-gene treatments amplified by these delivery bags of therapeutic agents offer a great clinical potential."
"The kidney is a remarkable organ that accomplishes the challenge of removing waste from the body and simultaneously regulating electrolyte and water balance. Pro-urine flows through the nephron in a highly dynamic manner and adjustment of the reabsorption rates of water and ions to the variable tubular flow is required for electrolyte homeostasis. Renal epithelial cells sense the tubular flow by mechanosensation. Interest in this phenomenon has increased in the past decade since the acknowledgement of primary cilia as antennae that sense renal tubular flow. However, the significance of tubular flow sensing for electrolyte handling is largely unknown. Signal transduction pathways regulating flow-sensitive physiological responses involve calcium, purinergic and nitric oxide signalling, and are considered to have an important role in renal electrolyte handling. Given that mechanosensation of tubular flow is an integral role of the nephron, defective tubular flow sensing is probably involved in renal disease. Studies investigating tubular flow and electrolyte transport differ in their methodology, subsequently hampering translational validity. This Review provides the basis for understanding electrolyte disorders originating from altered tubular flow sensing as a result of pathological conditions."
"This study aimed to evaluate the factors contributing to postoperative anterior relapse or posterior drift of the distal segment after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted which included 31 patients who underwent setback surgery for mandibular prognathism by the intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy technique. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of potential explanatory variables (sex, age, magnitude of setback, differences in setback magnitude between sides (right/left), duration of splint use, Angle’s classification of malocclusion, mandibular angle, and tightness of occlusion of the molars) with positional changes in the distal segment. The setback magnitude was only significant factor affecting (P = 0.015) for posterior drift, with significant posterior in setback magnitudes of less than 7.25 mm. Posterior drift after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy is less likely if setback magnitude exceeds 7.25 mm. For setbacks less than 7.25 mm, posterior drift should either be carefully corrected postoperatively, or an alternative surgical technique should be used. The setback magnitude showed a significant association with the risk of posterior drift following intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy, and the determined cut-off value may serve as a predictor for postoperative outcomes."
"In recent years, the deoxycytidine analogue gemcitabine (2′,2′,-difluorodeoxycytidine) has become the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for patients with pancreatic cancer. However, due to the intrinsic resistance of pancreatic cancer cells, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy yields limited disease control, with >85% disease progression at 6 months from diagnosis. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of chemoresistance is a critical step in improving cancer therapy, especially for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We show PROM2, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is ubiquitously upregulated in pancreatic cancer cell. We also found higher PROM2 expression is associated with shortened overall and disease-free survival times in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We provide evidence that PROM2 promotes chemoresistance to gemcitabine both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PROM2 could directly interacted with Akt and activates the Akt signaling pathway, which thus inhibiting gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. As further evidence, we show PROM2 expression and Akt phosphorylation both promote gemcitabine chemoresistance, and cause poorer survival in clinical samples with pancreatic cancer. Combining gemcitabine with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 facilitated significant tumor shrinkage and dramatically elevated the survival status in mice xenografted with pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings not only establish PROM2 as a novel positive regulator of the Akt signaling pathway and a candidate prognostic indicator of gemcitabine response, but also provide a neo-therapeutic approach for patients resistant to gemcitabine treatment."
"This study is intended to investigate the epigenetic regulation of the most conserved molecular chaperone, HSP70 and its potential role in the pathophysiology of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEXS) and glaucoma (PEXG), a protein aggregopathy, contributing significantly to world blindness. Expression levels of HSP70 were significantly decreased in the lens capsule (LC) of PEXS but not in PEXG compared with that in control. Bisulfite sequencing of the LC of the study subjects revealed that the CpG islands (CGIs) located in the exonic region but not in the promoter region of HSP70 displayed hypermethylation only in PEXS individuals. There was a corresponding increase in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression in only PEXS individuals suggesting de novo methylation in this stage of the disease condition. On the other hand, peripheral blood of both PEXS and PEXG cases showed hypermethylation in the exonic region when compared with non-PEX controls displaying tissue-specific effects. Further, functional analyses of CGI spanning the exon revealed a decreased gene expression in the presence of methylated in comparison with unmethylated reporter gene vectors. Treatment of human lens epithelial B-3 (HLE B-3) cells with DNMT inhibitor restored the expression of HSP70 following depletion in methylation level at exonic CpG sites. In conclusion, a decreased HSP70 expression correlates with hypermethylation of a CGI of HSP70 in PEXS individuals. The present findings enhance our current understanding of the mechanism underlying HSP70 repression, contributing to the pathogenesis of PEX."
"Metastasis is the leading cause of death for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the protein transport process involved in CRC metastasis remains unclear. In this report, we use whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify somatic mutations in CRC samples and found mutations of the protein transport gene Sec23 homolog B (SEC23B) in patients with metachronous liver metastasis. We show that deletion of SEC23B suppresses the membrane localization of adhesion proteins and augments cell mobility. SEC23B mutations either cause a premature stop (C649T) or impair its protein transport activity (C1467G and T488C + G791A + G2153A). Furthermore, SEC23B mutations inhibit the transport of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) and CD9 molecule, thereby attenuating cell adhesion and promoting invasiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate the important impact of SEC23B mutations on metastasis, and we propose that SEC23B is a potential suppressor of CRC metastasis."
"The development of deep learning algorithms for complex tasks in digital medicine has relied on the availability of large labeled training datasets, usually containing hundreds of thousands of examples. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D deep learning model, AppendiXNet, to detect appendicitis, one of the most common life-threatening abdominal emergencies, using a small training dataset of less than 500 training CT exams. We explored whether pretraining the model on a large collection of natural videos would improve the performance of the model over training the model from scratch. AppendiXNet was pretrained on a large collection of YouTube videos called Kinetics, consisting of approximately 500,000 video clips and annotated for one of 600 human action classes, and then fine-tuned on a small dataset of 438 CT scans annotated for appendicitis. We found that pretraining the 3D model on natural videos significantly improved the performance of the model from an AUC of 0.724 (95% CI 0.625, 0.823) to 0.810 (95% CI 0.725, 0.895). The application of deep learning to detect abnormalities on CT examinations using video pretraining could generalize effectively to other challenging cross-sectional medical imaging tasks when training data is limited."
"Stenotic lesion rigidity (SLR) has an unclear influence on the outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) for intracranial arterial stenosis. This study evaluated the outcome of PTAS and the relationship of vertebrobasilar SLR to features on vessel wall MRI (VW-MRI) for identifying pathologies of vertebrobasilar stenosis (VBS) and evaluating PTAS outcome. We retrospectively evaluated the results of PTAS in 31 patients with severe VBS. Stenotic lesions were classified as soft (based on predilatation pressure [PP] ≦ 4 atm) in 15 patients or hard (PP >4 atm) in 16 patients. We examined the relationship of SLR to clinical and MR findings. Patients with hard vs soft lesions had atherosclerosis (8/16 [50.0%] vs 2/15 [13.3%]), dissection (0/16 [0.0%] vs 12/15 [80.0%]), and dissection in atherosclerosis (8/16 [50.0%] vs 1/15 [6.7%], P < 0.0001); high intensity signal on the T1WI of VW-MRI (5/16 [31.3%] vs 14/15 [93.3%]) and iso- to low intensity signal (11/16 [68.7%] vs 1/15 [6.7], P = 0.001), and significant in-stent restenosis (>50%) in 5/15 (33.3%) vs 0/15 (0.0%) (P = 0.0421) in the 30 patients who successfully completed PTAS. Vertebrobasilar SLR correlated well with lesion etiology, findings on VW-MRI, and PTAS outcome. Patients with hard stenotic lesions need close follow-up after PTAS."
"Myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN) is a common cause of severe renal impairment in multiple myeloma (MM). The level of free light chain (FLC) that causes MCN varies substantially and there is uncertainty about the threshold level that should be used to inform clinical practice. In a multicentre cohort study of 103 patients with a diagnosis of MM and biopsy-confirmed MCN made between 2002–2014, we report prospectively measured levels of serum FLC at diagnosis obtained using a single nephelometric assay (Freelite®) and we explore the relationship between serum FLC level at diagnosis with renal outcome and patient survival. Using a landmark approach, overall survival (OS) was compared between patients who achieved independence from dialysis compared to those who remained dialysis dependent at 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month time points. The median serum FLC level at diagnosis was 7531 mg/L (range 107–114600). Serum creatinine was 535 μmol/L (range 168–2993) and eGFR 7 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range 1–34). Six patients (5.8%) had an FLC level <1500 mg/L, which is the International Myeloma Working Group threshold for MCN and two patients were below the International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy working group threshold of 500 mg/L; one was hypercalcaemic, and one had high-normal serum calcium level and had received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Sixty-nine (67%) patients required haemodialysis treatment of whom 36 (52.1%) recovered independent renal function. Sixty-six (64%) patients died with a median OS of 2.5 years (95% CI 1.8–3.3). A landmark analysis revealed that independence from dialysis was associated with improved survival at 3-months (P = 0.003), 6-months (P = 0.035) and 9-months (P = 0.014); there was no survival benefit observed beyond 12 months (P = 0.146). Serum FLC level at diagnosis was neither associated with renal function recovery nor with OS. This is the largest reported cohort of patients with biopsy-confirmed MCN and prospectively measured serum FLC levels. These results indicate that a serum monoclonal FLC > 500 mg/L should be considered the threshold level associated with the development of MCN."
"Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment can reduce itch and lower endogenous serum bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). We sought to determine how it could influence the gut environment in ICP to alter enterohepatic signalling. The gut microbiota and bile acid content were determined in faeces from 35 pregnant women (14 with uncomplicated pregnancies and 21 with ICP, 17 receiving UDCA). Faecal bile salt hydrolase activity was measured using a precipitation assay. Serum fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) concentrations were measured following a standardised diet for 21 hours. Women with a high ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes were more likely to be treated with UDCA (Fisher’s exact test p = 0.0178) than those with a lower ratio. Bile salt hydrolase activity was reduced in women with low Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes. Women taking UDCA had higher faecal lithocholic acid (p < 0.0001), with more unconjugated bile acids than women with untreated ICP or uncomplicated pregnancy. UDCA-treatment increased serum FGF19, and reduced C4 (reflecting lower bile acid synthesis). During ICP, UDCA treatment can be associated with enrichment of the gut microbiota with Bacteroidetes. These demonstrate high bile salt hydrolase activity, which deconjugates bile acids enabling secondary modification to FXR agonists, enhancing enterohepatic feedback via FGF19."
"BackgroundIncreasing attention has been drawn on the assessment of body composition phenotypes, since the distribution of soft tissue influences cardio-metabolic risk. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a validated technique to assess body composition. European reference values from population-based cohorts are rare.AimsTo provide age- and sex-related reference values of body composition parameters and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, and for lean mass index (LMI) with regard to fat mass index (FMI) quantities and BMI categories.MethodsGE-Lunar Prodigy DXA scans of 10.894 participants, aged 18–81 years, recruited from 2011 to 2019 by the Austrian LEAD study, a population-based cohort study, have been used to construct reference curves using the LMS method. Parameters assessed are FMI, LMI, appendicular LMI, fat mass ratios android/gynoid and trunk/limbs, and VAT.ResultsAll lean mass and fat mass parameters indicating central fat accumulation were higher in men, whereas other fat mass indices were higher in women. LMI differed between each FMI subgroup (low vs. normal, low vs. high, normal vs. high), and BMI category in all ages and LMI increased with FMI and BMI classes. VAT mass was higher in men compared with women and increased across all age groups within both sexes.ConclusionThe present study provides age- and sex-related reference values for European adults aged 18–81 years for body composition parameters and VAT mass for Lunar Prodigy DXA. In addition, this study reports LMI reference values with regard to fat mass quantities, showing a positive association with increasing FMI percentiles and BMI categories."
"Memory for prior drinking experiences may powerfully drive later alcohol use in familiar drinking contexts, yet we know little about what patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) remember of alcohol-related episodes. Although animal and theoretical models of addiction emphasize the importance of different memory systems for understanding maladaptive use, clinical research parsing what AUD patients remember from alcohol-related episodes is lacking. The current study applied a novel memory task in which moderate drinkers (N = 30) and treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD: N = 29) encoded associations between photographs of objects (alcoholic beverages and neutral items) and photographs of neutral scenes. At least 24 h later, two types of memory were assessed: item memory (object recognition) and associative memory (cued recognition of scenes associated with objects). To assess which memories predicted drinking, real-world behavior was assessed in patients with AUD at baseline and for 4 weeks following memory tests. Despite demographic differences, the results showed broadly impaired item memory in AUD compared with moderate drinkers (p < 0.001), but enhanced associative memory for scenes paired with alcohol (p = 0.015). These associative memory biases were especially pronounced for stimuli rated as more affectively salient. Furthermore, stronger but less detailed memory for alcohol-related associations (i.e., choosing the correct scene but the incorrect photograph) significantly predicted heavier baseline (p = 0.002) and higher subsequent (p = 0.01) drinking in patients with AUD. These findings reveal a novel alcohol-related memory bias in AUD, and uncover the importance of associative memory for understanding real-world heavy alcohol use."
"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is the most frequently used score worldwide for assessing the clinical severity of a stroke. Prior research suggested an association between acute symptomatic seizures after stroke and poorer outcome. We determined the frequency of acute seizures after ischemic stroke in a large population-based registry in a central European region between 2004 and 2016 and identified risk factors for acute seizures in univariate and multivariate analyses. Additionally, we determined the influence of seizures on morbidity and mortality in a matched case–control design. Our analysis of 135,117 cases demonstrated a seizure frequency of 1.3%. Seizure risk was 0.6% with an NIHSS score at admission <3 points and increased up to 7.0% with >31 score points. Seizure risk was significantly higher in the presence of acute non-neurological infections (odds ratio: 3.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.8–4.1). A lower premorbid functional level also significantly increased seizure risk (OR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.4–2.0). Mortality in patients with acute symptomatic seizures was almost doubled when compared to controls matched for age, gender, and stroke severity. Acute symptomatic seizures increase morbidity and mortality in ischemic stroke. Their odds increase with a higher NIHSS score at admission."
"DNA methylation of various genomic regions has been found to be associated with gene expression in diverse biological contexts. However, most genome-wide studies have focused on the effect of (1) methylation in cis, not in trans and (2) a single CpG, not the collective effects of multiple CpGs, on gene expression. In this study, we developed a statistical machine learning model, geneEXPLORE (gene expression prediction by long-range epigenetics), that quantifies the collective effects of both cis- and trans- methylations on gene expression. By applying geneEXPLORE to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast and 10 other types of cancer data, we found that most genes are associated with methylations of as much as 10 Mb from the promoters or more, and the long-range methylation explains 50% of the variation in gene expression on average, far greater than cis-methylation. geneEXPLORE outperforms competing methods such as BioMethyl and MethylXcan. Further, the predicted gene expressions could predict clinical phenotypes such as breast tumor status and estrogen receptor status (AUC = 0.999, 0.94 respectively) as accurately as the measured gene expression levels. These results suggest that geneEXPLORE provides a means for accurate imputation of gene expression, which can be further used to predict clinical phenotypes."
"Hyper-reactivity to sensory input is a common and debilitating symptom in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the neural basis underlying sensory abnormality is not completely understood. Here we examined the neural representations of sensory perception in the neocortex of a Shank3B−/− mouse model of ASD. Male and female Shank3B−/− mice were more sensitive to relatively weak tactile stimulation in a vibrissa motion detection task. In vivo population calcium imaging in vibrissa primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) revealed increased spontaneous and stimulus-evoked firing in pyramidal neurons but reduced activity in interneurons. Preferential deletion of Shank3 in vS1 inhibitory interneurons led to pyramidal neuron hyperactivity and increased stimulus sensitivity in the vibrissa motion detection task. These findings provide evidence that cortical GABAergic interneuron dysfunction plays a key role in sensory hyper-reactivity in a Shank3 mouse model of ASD and identify a potential cellular target for exploring therapeutic interventions."
"Hypoxia is a critical factor in the malignant progression of glioma, especially for the highly-invasive mesenchymal (MES) subtype. But the detailed mechanisms in hypoxia-induced glioma MES transition remain elusive. Pseudogenes, once considered to be non-functional relics of evolution, are emerging as a critical factor in human tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we investigated the clinical significance, biological function, and mechanisms of protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P1) in hypoxia-induced glioma MES transition. In this study, we found that PDIA3P1 expression was closely related to tumor degree, transcriptome subtype, and prognosis in glioma patients. Enrichment analysis found that high PDIA3P1 expression was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix (ECM) disassembly, and angiogenesis. In vitro study revealed that overexpression of PDIA3P1 enhanced the migration and invasion capacity of glioma cells, while knockdown of PDIA3P1 induced the opposite effect. Further studies revealed that PDIA3P1 functions as a ceRNA, sponging miR-124-3p to modulate RELA expression and activate the downstream NF-κB pathway, thus promoting the MES transition of glioma cells. In addition, Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 was confirmed to directly bind to the PDIA3P1 promotor region and activate its transcription. In conclusion, PDIA3P1 is a crucial link between hypoxia and glioma MES transition through the PDIA3P1-miR-124-3p-RELA axis, which may serve as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target for glioma treatment."
"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies and is characterized by a low 5-year survival rate, a broad genetic diversity and a high resistance to conventional therapies. As a result, novel therapeutic agents to improve the current situation are needed urgently. Curcumin, a polyphenolic colorant derived from Curcuma longa root, showed pleiotropic influences on cellular pathways in vitro and amongst others anti-cancer properties including sensitization of tumor cells to chemo- and radiation-therapy. In this study, we evaluated the impact of Curcumin on the radiosensitivity of the established human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 in vitro. In contrast to MiaPaCa-2 cells, we found a significant radiosensitization by Curcumin in the more radioresistant Panc-1 cells, possibly caused by cell cycle arrest in the most radiation-sensitive G2/M-phase at the time of irradiation. Furthermore, a significant enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis, DNA-double-strand breaks and G2/M-arrest after curcumin treatment was observed in both cell lines. These in vitro findings suggest that especially patients with more radioresistant tumors could benefit from a radiation-concomitant, phytotherapeutic therapy with Curcumin."
"Central visual field (CVF) loss is important in maintaining vision-related quality of life in eyes with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). The present study investigated whether nasalized location of central retinal vessel trunk (CRVT) at baseline is associated with rapid rate of CVF loss in early-stage OAG eyes. This study included 76 OAG eyes with high nasalization CRVT [HNL] group and 75 OAG eyes with low nasalization CRVT [LNL] group matched for glaucoma severity at baseline that showed progressive visual field (VF) loss. The rates of mean threshold changes at various regions were compared in the two groups using a linear mixed model. Clinical variables associated with rapid rate of CVF progression were also identified using a linear mixed model. The rate of CVF loss in the central 10° was significantly higher in the HNL group than that in the LNL group (−0.452 dB/year vs. −0.291 dB/year, P < 0.001). The average and inferior hemi-macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) progression rates were significantly faster in the HNL group than in the LNL group (P < 0.05). Nasalized location of CRVT was an independent predictor of a more rapid VF loss in the central 10° region (P < 0.05)."
"MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is a stress-induced protein involved in activation of NK and T cells through interaction with NKG2D receptor. These molecules are atypically expressed in synovium of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 279 patients with RA, qualified to TNF-blockade therapy, were genotyped for MICA rs1051792 SNP. The effectiveness of anti-TNF agents was assessed with European League Against Rheumatism criteria. Significant relationship between MICA rs1051792 and outcome of TNF-blockade therapy has been found. The MICA rs1051792 GG genotype was overrepresented in patients non-responsive to anti-TNF drugs in comparison with other genotypes (p = 0.010). On the other hand, beneficial therapeutic response was more frequently detected among RA subjects possessing heterozygous genotype than those with homozygous genotypes (p = 0.003). Furthermore, increased MICA concentrations in serum were observed in patients possessing MICA rs1051792 GG genotype as compared with those with GA or AA genotypes (p = 1.8 × 10−5). The results from this study indicate the potential influence of MICA rs1051792 polymorphism on modulation of therapeutic response to TNF-blockade treatment in RA."
"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of tumorigenesis and are frequently dysregulated in cancers. Here, we identify a critical lncRNA TRPM2-AS which is aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer (GC) tissues by screening The Cancer Genome Atlas Program(TCGA) database of GC cohort, and its upregulation is clinically associated with advanced pathologic stages and poor prognosis in GC patients. Silencing TRPM2-AS inhibits the proliferation, metastasis and radioresistance of GC cell whereas ectopic expression of TRPM2-AS significantly improves the progression of GC cell in multiple experiments. Mechanistically, TRPM2-AS serves as a microRNA sponge or a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for tumor suppressive microRNA miR-612 and consequently modulates the derepression of IGF2BP1 and FOXM1. Moreover, induced upregulation of IGF2BP1 subsequently increases the expression of c-Myc and promotes GC cell progression. Meanwhile, TRPM2-AS promotes the radioreistance of GC cell through enhancing the expression of FOXM1 as well. Thus, our findings support a new regulatory axis between TRPM2-AS, miR-612, IGF2BP1, or FOXM1 which serve as crucial effectors in GC tumorigenesis and malignant development, suggesting a promising therapeutic and diagnostic direction for GC."
"Nonhereditary factors play an important role in the occurrence of congenital heart disease (CHD). This study was to explore the possible parental nonhereditary exposure factors relevant to the occurrence of CHD in the northeastern Sichuan area. A total of 367 children with CHD and 367 children without congenital malformations aged 0 to 14 years old were recruited from the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and Nanchong Central Hospital between March 2016 and November 2018. This study was designed as a case-control study with 1:1 frequency matching, in which the parents of cases and controls were interviewed with the same questionnaire according to the gestational age of the child, maternal age during pregnancy and the same maternal race/ethnicity. Then, 322 matched case-control pairs were analysed by SPSS 22. Thirty-one suspicious factors were entered into the binary logistic regression analysis after univariate regression analysis of 55 factors (alpha = 0.05). The analysis results showed that 7 factors were significantly associated with the occurrence of CHD. Thus, augmenting maternal mental healthcare, improving the quality of drinking water, obtaining adequate nutrition, maintaining a healthy physical condition during pregnancy, enhancing parents’ level of knowledge and maintaining a healthy lifestyle may lower the occurrence of CHD."
"Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) might be increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but its usefulness for differential diagnosis and prognosis is unclear. We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87–0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94–0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort. High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects. In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials."
"Multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines are routinely used to model the disease. However, a long-standing question is how well these cell lines truly represent tumor cells in patients. Here, we employ a recently described method of transcriptional correlation profiling to compare similarity of 66 MM cell lines to 779 newly diagnosed MM patient tumors. We found that individual MM lines differ significantly with respect to patient tumor representation, with median R ranging from 0.35 to 0.54. ANBL-6 was the “best” line, markedly exceeding all others (p < 2.2e−16). Notably, some widely used cell lines (RPMI-8226, U-266) scored poorly in our patient similarity ranking (48 and 52 of 66, respectively). Lines cultured with interleukin-6 showed significantly improved correlations with patient tumor (p = 9.5e−4). When common MM genomic features were matched between cell lines and patients, only t(4;14) and t(14;16) led to increased transcriptional correlation. To demonstrate the utility of our top-ranked line for preclinical studies, we showed that intravenously implanted ANBL-6 proliferates in hematopoietic organs in immunocompromised mice. Overall, our large-scale quantitative correlation analysis, utilizing emerging datasets, provides a resource informing the MM community of cell lines that may be most reliable for modeling patient disease while also elucidating biological differences between cell lines and tumors."
"The functional quality of the inflow artery is one of the most important determinants of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) success. We evaluated the association of early optimal brachial arterial dilatation with a successful AVF maturation and assessed the role of peribrachial adipose tissue in determining brachial arterial distensibility. All patients underwent a preoperative vascular mapping with Doppler ultrasound (US), and only patients who had suitable vessels for AVF creation were enrolled (n = 162). Peribrachial fat thickness was measured using US. To evaluate the degree of brachial dilatation, follow-up US was performed at 1 month after surgery, and early brachial artery dilation was defined as the change in postoperative arterial diameter compared to the preoperative value. The primary outcome was failure to achieve a clinically functional AVF within 8 weeks. Nonfunctional AVF occurred in 21 (13.0%) patients, and they had a significantly lower brachial dilatation than patients with successful AVF during early period after surgery (0.85 vs. 0.43 mm, p = 0.003). Patients with a brachial dilatation greater than median level showed a 1.8-times higher rate of achieving a successful AVF than those without. Interestingly, the early brachial dilatation showed significant correlations with diabetes (r = −0.260, p = 0.001), peribrachial fat thickness (r = −0.301, p = 0.008), and the presence of brachial artery calcification (r = −0.178, p = 0.036). Even after adjustments for demographic factors, comorbidities, and baseline brachial flow volume, peribrachial fat thickness was an independent determinant for early brachial dilatation (β = −0.286, p = 0.013). A close interplay between the peri-brachial fat and brachial dilatation can be translated into novel clinical tools to predict successful AVF maturation."
"Telomerase deficiency leads to age-related diseases and shorter lifespans. Inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) delays aging and age-related pathologies. Here, we show that telomerase deficient mice with short telomeres (G2-Terc−/−) have an hyper-activated mTOR pathway with increased levels of phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein in liver, skeletal muscle and heart, a target of mTORC1. Transcriptional profiling confirms mTOR activation in G2-Terc−/− livers. Treatment of G2-Terc−/− mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, decreases survival, in contrast to lifespan extension in wild-type controls. Deletion of mTORC1 downstream S6 kinase 1 in G3-Terc−/− mice also decreases longevity, in contrast to lifespan extension in single S6K1−/− female mice. These findings demonstrate that mTOR is important for survival in the context of short telomeres, and that its inhibition is deleterious in this setting. These results are of clinical interest in the case of human syndromes characterized by critically short telomeres."
"In Tanzania, chloroquine was replaced by sulphadoxine- pyrimethamine (SP) as a first-line for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Due to high resistance in malaria parasites, SP lasted for only 5 years and by the end of 2006 it was replaced with the current artemisinin combination therapy. We therefore, set a study to determine the current genotypic mutations associated with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin, partner drugs and chloroquine. Parasites DNA were extracted from dried blood spots collected by finger-prick from Tanzanian malaria infected patients. DNA were sequenced using MiSeq then genotypes were translated into drug resistance haplotypes at Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK. About 422 samples were successful sequenced for K13 gene (marker for artemisinin resistance), the wild type (WT) was found in 391 samples (92.7%) whereby 31 samples (7.3%) had mutations in K13 gene. Of 31 samples with mutations, one sample had R561H, a mutation that has been associated with delayed parasite clearance in Southeast Asia, another sample had A578S, a mutation not associated with artemisinin whilst 29 samples had K13 novel mutations. There were no mutations in PGB, EXO, P23_BP and PfMDR1 at position 86 and 1246 (markers for resistance in artemisinin partner drugs) but 270 samples (60.4%) had mutations at PfMDR1 Y184F. Additionally, genotyped PfCRT at positions 72–76 (major predictors for chroquine resistance), found WT gene in 443 out of 444 samples (99.8%). In conclusion, this study found mutations in K13-propeller gene and high prevalence of chloroquine susceptible P. falciparum in Southeast of Tanzania."
"The development of a safe and efficacious Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine remains a global health priority. In our previous work, we developed an Adenovirus vectored ZIKV vaccine using a low-seroprevalent human Adenovirus type 4 (Ad4-prM-E) and compared it to an Ad5 vector (Ad5-prM-E). We found that vaccination with Ad4-prM-E leads to the development of a strong anti-ZIKV T-cell response without eliciting significant anti-ZIKV antibodies, while vaccination with Ad5-prM-E leads to the development of both anti-ZIKV antibody and T-cell responses in C57BL/6 mice. However, both vectors conferred protection against ZIKV infection in a lethal challenge model. Here we continued to characterize the T-cell biased immune response observed in Ad4 immunized mice. Vaccination of BALB/c mice resulted in immune correlates similar to C57BL/6 mice, confirming that this response is not mouse strain-specific. Vaccination with an Ad4 expressing an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein resulted in anti-HA T-cell responses without the development of significant anti-HA antibodies, indicating this unique response is specific to the Ad4 serotype rather than the transgene expressed. Co-administration of a UV inactivated Ad4 vector with the Ad5-prM-E vaccine led to a significant reduction in anti-ZIKV antibody development suggesting that this serotype-specific immune profile is capsid-dependent. These results highlight the serotype-specific immune profiles elicited by different Adenovirus vector types and emphasize the importance of continued characterization of these alternative Ad serotypes."
"Targeted delivery of a nanovaccine loaded with a tumor antigen and adjuvant to the lymph nodes (LNs) is an attractive approach for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, the application of this technique is restricted by the paucity of suitable tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and the sophisticated technology required to identify tumor neoantigens. Here, we demonstrate that a self-assembling melittin-lipid nanoparticle (α-melittin-NP) that is not loaded with extra tumor antigens promotes whole tumor antigen release in situ and results in the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in LNs. Compared with free melittin, α-melittin-NPs markedly enhance LN accumulation and activation of APCs, leading to a 3.6-fold increase in antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Furthermore, in a bilateral flank B16F10 tumor model, primary and distant tumor growth are significantly inhibited by α-melittin-NPs, with an inhibition rate of 95% and 92%, respectively. Thus, α-melittin-NPs induce a systemic anti-tumor response serving as an effective LN-targeted whole-cell nanovaccine."
"Studies on the expression of cellular glycans are limited by a lack of sensitive tools that can discriminate specific structural features. Here we describe the development of a robust platform using immunized lampreys (Petromyzon marinus), which secrete variable lymphocyte receptors called VLRBs as antibodies, for generating libraries of anti-glycan reagents. We identified a wide variety of glycan-specific VLRBs detectable in lamprey plasma after immunization with whole fixed cells, tissue homogenates, and human milk. The cDNAs from lamprey lymphocytes were cloned into yeast surface display (YSD) libraries for enrichment by multiple methods. We generated VLRB-Ig chimeras, termed smart anti-glycan reagents (SAGRs), whose specificities were defined by microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry. 15 VLRB antibodies were discovered that discriminated between linkages, functional groups and unique presentations of the terminal glycan motif. The development of SAGRs will enhance future studies on glycan expression by providing sequenced, defined antibodies for a variety of research applications."
"The interaction between immune cells and phosphatidylserine (PS) molecules exposed on the surface of apoptotic-tumor bodies, such as those induced by chemotherapies, contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Annexin A5 (AnxA5) binds with high affinity to PS externalized by apoptotic cells, thereby hindering their interaction with immune cells. Here, we show that AnxA5 administration rescue the immunosuppressive state of the TME induced by chemotherapy. Due to the preferential homing of AnxA5 to the TME enriched with PS+ tumor cells, we demonstrate in vivo that fusing tumor-antigen peptide to AnxA5 significantly enhances its immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy when administered after chemotherapy. Also, the therapeutic antitumor effect of an AnxA5-peptide fusion can be further enhanced by administration of other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our findings support the administration of AnxA5 following chemotherapy as a promising immune checkpoint inhibitor for cancer treatment."
"Heterochromatin is essential for regulating global gene transcription and protecting genome stability, and may play a role in tumor suppression. Drugs promoting heterochromatin are potential cancer therapeutics but very few are known. In order to identify drugs that can promote heterochromatin, we used a cell-based method and screened NCI drug libraries consisting of oncology drugs and natural compounds. Since heterochromatin is originally defined as intensely stained chromatin in the nucleus, we estimated heterochromatin contents of cells treated with different drugs by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of nuclei stained with Hoechst DNA dye. We used HeLa cells and screened 231 FDA-approved oncology and natural substance drugs included in two NCI drug libraries representing a variety of chemical structures. Among these drugs, streptonigrin most prominently caused an increase in Hoechst-stained nuclear fluorescence intensity. We further show that streptonigrin treated cells exhibit compacted DNA foci in the nucleus that co-localize with Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha (HP1α), and exhibit an increase in total levels of the heterochromatin mark, H3K9me3. Interestingly, we found that streptonigrin promotes heterochromatin at a concentration as low as one nanomolar, and at this concentration there were no detectable effects on cell proliferation or viability. Finally, in line with a previous report, we found that streptonigrin inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, raising the possibility that non-canonical STAT function may contribute to the effects of streptonigrin on heterochromatin. These results suggest that, at low concentrations, streptonigrin may primarily enhance heterochromatin formation with little toxic effects on cells, and therefore might be a good candidate for epigenetic cancer therapy."
"Modern cytometry methods allow collecting complex, multi-dimensional data sets from heterogeneous cell populations at single-cell resolution. While methods exist to describe the progression and order of cellular processes from snapshots of such populations, these descriptions are limited to arbitrary pseudotime scales. Here we describe MAPiT, an universal transformation method that recovers real-time dynamics of cellular processes from pseudotime scales by utilising knowledge of the distributions on the real scales. As use cases, we applied MAPiT to two prominent problems in the flow-cytometric analysis of heterogeneous cell populations: (1) recovering the kinetics of cell cycle progression in unsynchronised and thus unperturbed cell populations, and (2) recovering the spatial arrangement of cells within multi-cellular spheroids prior to spheroid dissociation for cytometric analysis. Since MAPiT provides a theoretic basis for the relation of pseudotime values to real temporal and spatial scales, it can be used broadly in the analysis of cellular processes with snapshot data from heterogeneous cell populations."
"Spatial heterogeneity is a fundamental feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and tackling spatial heterogeneity in neoplastic metabolic aberrations is critical for tumor treatment. Genome-scale metabolic network models have been used successfully to simulate cancer metabolic networks. However, most models use bulk gene expression data of entire tumor biopsies, ignoring spatial heterogeneity in the TME. To account for spatial heterogeneity, we performed spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of the prostate cancer microenvironment. We discovered novel malignant-cell-specific metabolic vulnerabilities targetable by small molecule compounds. We predicted that inhibiting the fatty acid desaturase SCD1 may selectively kill cancer cells based on our discovery of spatial separation of fatty acid synthesis and desaturation. We also uncovered higher prostaglandin metabolic gene expression in the tumor, relative to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, we predicted that inhibiting the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 may selectively kill cancer cells. Importantly, SCD1 and SLCO2A1 have been previously shown to be potently and selectively inhibited by compounds such as CAY10566 and suramin, respectively. We also uncovered cancer-selective metabolic liabilities in central carbon, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Our novel cancer-specific predictions provide new opportunities to develop selective drug targets for prostate cancer and other cancers where spatial transcriptomics datasets are available."
"The prevention of decrease of quality caused by microbial activity in footwear materials entails the use of biocides. However, these substances may pose a hazard to humans and to the natural environment. The paper presents the results of antimicrobial effect investigation for cowhide leather treated with oregano oil. In these studies oil was applied by spraying onto the finished leather surface and examined to determine its antimicrobial activity by using the Agar Diffusion Plate Test. These results were compared with those where a cowhide leather was treated with oil at the stage of fatliquoring. In addition, the oregano oil toxicity level was assessed and compared with biocides used in the tanning industry. Introducing oregano oil into the leather at the stage of fatliquoring provides a better antimicrobial effect than by spraying, however hygienic finishing of leather can be obtained by introducing oil into the raw material by these both methods. The oregano oil is characterised by the lowest number of hazards and toxicity as compared with commercial biocides. The use of essential oils as natural biocides in the tanning industry seems to be especially important and suitable solution considering the harmful effects of synthetic biocides to humans and the environment."
"The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by trillions of microorganisms that interact with the host to maintain structural and functional homeostasis. Acting as the interface between the site of the highest microbial burden in the human body and the richest immune compartment, a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells specializes in nutrient absorption, stratifies microorganisms to limit colonization of tissues and shapes the responses of the subepithelial immune cells. In this Review, we focus on the expression, regulation and functions of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the different intestinal epithelial lineages to analyse how epithelial recognition of bacteria participates in establishing homeostasis in the gut. In particular, we elaborate on the involvement of epithelial TLR signalling in controlling crypt dynamics, enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and promoting immune tolerance towards the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we comment on the regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune TLR-driven immune responses towards pathogens and revisit the role of TLRs in epithelial repair after injury. Finally, we discuss how dysregulation of epithelial TLRs can lead to the generation of dysbiosis, thereby increasing susceptibility to colitis and tumorigenesis."
"Obesity is one of the most important risk factors of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but its impact on clinical and functional consequences is less clear. The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to describe the relation between body mass index (BMI) and clinical expression of KOA. Participants with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and KOA completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires. They were classified according to BMI in three groups: overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m2), stage I obesity (BMI 30–35 kg/m2) and stage II/III obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2). The groups were compared in terms of pain, physical disability, level of physical activity (PA) and fears and beliefs concerning KOA. Among the 391 individuals included, 57.0% were overweight, 28.4% had stage I obesity and 14.6% had stage II/III obesity. Mean pain score on a 10-point visual analog scale was 4.3 (SD 2.4), 5.0 (SD 2.6) and 5.2 (SD 2.3) with overweight, stage I and stage II/III obesity, respectively (p = 0.0367). The mean WOMAC function score (out of 100) was 36.2 (SD 20.1), 39.5 (SD 21.4) and 45.6 (SD 18.4), respectively (p = 0.0409). The Knee Osteoarthritis Fears and Beliefs Questionnaire total score (KOFBEQ), daily activity score and physician score significantly differed among BMI groups (p = 0.0204, p = 0.0389 and p = 0.0413, respectively), and the PA level significantly differed (p = 0.0219). We found a dose–response relation between BMI and the clinical consequences of KOA. Strategies to treat KOA should differ by obesity severity. High PA level was associated with low BMI and contributes to preventing the clinical consequences of KOA."
"Myelofibrosis (MF) occurs as part of the natural history of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), and remarkably shortens survival. Although JAK2V617F and CALR allele burden are the main transformation risk factors, inflammation plays a critical role by driving clonal expansion toward end-stage disease. NF-κB is a key mediator of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Here, we explored the involvement of miR-146a, a brake in NF-κB signaling, in MPN susceptibility and progression. rs2910164 and rs2431697, that affect miR-146a expression, were analyzed in 967 MPN (320 PV/333 ET/314 MF) patients and 600 controls. We found that rs2431697 TT genotype was associated with MF, particularly with post-PV/ET MF (HR = 1.5; p < 0.05). Among 232 PV/ET patients (follow-up time=8.5 years), 18 (7.8%) progressed to MF, being MF-free-survival shorter for rs2431697 TT than CC + CT patients (p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified TT genotype as independent predictor of MF progression. In addition, TT (vs. CC + CT) patients showed increased plasma inflammatory cytokines. Finally, miR-146a−/− mice showed significantly higher Stat3 activity with aging, parallel to the development of the MF-like phenotype. In conclusion, we demonstrated that rs2431697 TT genotype is an early predictor of MF progression independent of the JAK2V617F allele burden. Low levels of miR-146a contribute to the MF phenotype by increasing Stat3 signaling."
"Lung cancer occurrence and associated mortality ranks top in all countries. Despite the rapid development of targeted and immune therapies, many patients experience relapse within a few years. It is urgent to uncover the mechanisms that drive lung cancer progression and identify novel molecular targets. Our group has previously identified FGF19 as a prognostic marker and potential driver gene of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSQ) in Chinese smoking patients. However, the underlying mechanism of how FGF19 promotes the progression of LSQ remains unclear. In this study, we characterized and confirmed that FGF19 serves as an oncogenic driver in LSQ development and progression, and reported that the amplification and high expression of FGF19 in LSQ was significantly associated with poor overall and progression-free survival. A higher serum level of FGF19 was found in lung cancer patients, which could also serve as a novel diagnostic index to screen lung cancer. Overproduction of FGF19 in LSQ cells markedly promoted cell growth, progression and metastasis, while downregulating FGF19 effectively inhibited LSQ progression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, downregulating the receptor FGFR4 was also effective to suppress the growth and migration of LSQ cells. Since FGF19 could be induced by smoking or endoplasmic reticulum stress, to tackle the more malignant FGF19-overproducing LSQ, we reported for the first time that inhibiting mTOR pathway by using AZD2014 was effective and feasible. These findings have offered a new strategy by using anti-FGF19/FGFR4 therapy or mTOR-based therapy in FGF19-driven LSQ."
"Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity is the major cause of death in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Previous studies on mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms in SLE patients suggest that low levels of complement MBL are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, as large studies on MBL deficiency based on resulting MBL plasma concentrations are lacking, the aim of our study was to analyze the association of MBL concentrations with CVD in SLE patients. Plasma MBL levels SLE patients included in the Swiss SLE Cohort Study were quantified by ELISA. Five different CV organ manifestations were documented. Of 373 included patients (85.5% female) 62 patients had at least one CV manifestation. Patients with MBL deficiency (levels below 500 ng/ml or 1000 ng/ml) had no significantly increased frequency of CVD (19.4% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.3 or 17.7% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.7). After adjustment for traditional CV risk factors, MBL levels and positive antiphospholipid serology (APL+) a significant association of CVD with age, hypertension, disease duration and APL+ was demonstrated. In our study of a large cohort of patients with SLE, we could not confirm previous studies suggesting MBL deficiency to be associated with an increased risk for CVD."
"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy as apneic oxygenation in critically ill patients who require endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU). This systematic review and meta-analysis included six randomized controlled trials and a prospective study identified in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science until August 18, 2019. In this meta-analysis including 956 participants, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care during endotracheal intubation regarding incidence of severe hypoxemia, mean lowest oxygen saturation, and in-hospital mortality. HFNC significantly shortened the ICU stay by a mean of 1.8 days. In linear meta-regression interaction analysis, the risk ratio of severe hypoxemia decreased with increasing baseline partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio. In subgroup analysis, HFNC significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2> 200 mmHg; risk difference, −0.06; 95% confidence interval, −0.12 to −0.01; number needed to treat = 16.7). In conclusion, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care for oxygen delivery during endotracheal intubation and was associated with a significantly shorter ICU stay. The beneficial effect of HFNC in reducing the incidence of severe hypoxemia was observed in patients with mild hypoxemia."
"The efficacy of nano-mediated drug delivery has been impeded by multiple biological barriers such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), as well as vascular and interstitial barriers. To overcome the abovementioned obstacles, we report a nano-pathogenoid (NPN) system that can in situ hitchhike circulating neutrophils and supplement photothermal therapy (PTT). Cloaked with bacteria-secreted outer membrane vesicles inheriting pathogen-associated molecular patterns of native bacteria, NPNs are effectively recognized and internalized by neutrophils. The neutrophils migrate towards inflamed tumors, extravasate across the blood vessels, and penetrate through the tumors. Then NPNs are rapidly released from neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimuli and subsequently taken up by tumor cells to exert anticancer effects. Strikingly, due to the excellent targeting efficacy, cisplatin-loaded NPNs combined with PTT completely eradicate tumors in all treated mice. Such a nano-platform represents an efficient and generalizable strategy towards in situ cell hitchhiking as well as enhanced tumor targeted delivery."
"Objective(1) Determine national prevalence and predictors of donor milk programs among levels 2–4 advanced neonatal care facilities; (2) describe characteristics of donor milk programs.Study designWe randomly selected 120 U.S. hospitals with levels 2–4 advanced neonatal care facilities among each of four U.S. regions and surveyed the medical directors from July 2017 to November 2017 regarding donor milk use. We weighted responses according to the number of birthing hospitals in each region.ResultsResponse rate was 213/480 (44%). Twenty-eight percent of level 2 and 88% of levels 3 and 4 neonatal care facilities had donor milk programs. Donor milk programs occurred more often in the South vs. Northeast (aOR 3.7 [1.1, 12.5] and less often in safety-net hospitals (≥75% Medicaid patients) vs. nonsafety-net hospitals (aOR 0.3 [0.1, 0.8]).ConclusionIn 2017, the vast majority of levels 3 and 4 neonatal care facilities had donor milk programs but disparities existed according to the safety-net hospital status and region."
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mouse and human lung is associated with oxidative injury and pathogenic inflammation. RSV impairs antioxidant responses by increasing the degradation of transcription factor NRF2, which controls the expression of several antioxidant enzyme (AOE) genes, including catalase. Since catalase is a key enzyme for the dismutation of virus-mediated generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) we developed a model of intranasal supplementation of polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase (PG-CAT) for RSV-infected mice. The results of our study show that PG-CAT supplementation was able to increase specific enzymatic activity along with reduction in H2O2 in the airways and had a significant protective effect against RSV-induced clinical disease and airway pathology. PG-CAT treated mice showed amelioration in airway obstruction, reduction in neutrophil elastase and inflammation. Improved airway hyperresponsiveness was also observed in mice that received PG-CAT as a treatment post-viral inoculation. In addition, PG-CAT greatly reduced the concentration of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1, TNF-α, IL-9, CXCL1, CCL2, and CCL5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of RSV-infected mice, without increasing viral replication in the lung. In conclusion, catalase supplementation may represent a novel pharmacologic approach to be explored in human for prevention or treatment of respiratory infections caused by RSV."
"In this study we assessed the clinical significance of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature and explored its association with the tumor microenvironment related to immunotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Genes were selected when mRNA levels were positively or negatively correlated with at least one well-known EMT marker. We developed an EMT gene signature consisting of 82 genes. The patients were classified into epithelial or mesenchymal subgroups according to EMT signature. The clinical significance of the EMT signature was validated in three independent cohorts and its association with several immunotherapy-related signatures was investigated. The mesenchymal subgroup showed worse prognosis than the epithelial subgroup, and significantly elevated PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 levels, and increased interferon-gamma, cytolytic, T cell infiltration, overall immune infiltration, and immune signature scores. The relationship between PD-L1 expression and EMT status in HNSCC after treatment with TGF-β was validated in vitro. In conclusion, the EMT gene signature was associated with prognosis in HNSCC. Additionally, our results suggest that EMT is related to immune activity of the tumor microenvironment with elevated immune checkpoint molecules."
"Cyclosporine A (CsA) extracted from the products of fungal fermentation is used to develop a chronic nephropathy model. However, it has numerous side effects. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin that induces renal injury. We developed a chronic nephropathy model to lessen the side effects of CsA by administration of nontoxic dosage of OTA, and investigated the underlying mechanism. C57BL/10 wild-type mice, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)−/− mice, and HK-2 cells were used in this study. The nontoxic dosage (0.25 mg/kg, qod) of OTA could significantly decrease the dosage of CsA from 30 to 20 mg/kg per day, and combination of them induced chronic nephropathy model and alleviated the side effects of onefold CsA in vivo, including cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and immunosuppression. The nontoxic concentration (0.5 μg/ml) of OTA could significantly decrease the concentration of CsA from 10 to 6 μg/ml that induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and nephrotoxicity in vitro. Nontoxic concentration of OTA and low dosage of CsA activated TLR4 and autophagy. These toxic effects induced by OTA and CsA could be reversed by knockdown of TLR4 and autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine in vitro. Furthermore, the renal injury and autophagy induced by OTA and CsA could be attenuated in TLR4−/− mice. It suggested that a chronic nephropathy model had been successfully developed by administration of nontoxic concentration of OTA and low dosage of CsA via TLR4-mediated autophagy. The side effects of current model were significantly lesser than those of the previous model induced by onefold CsA. It provided a new tool for exploring the pathogenesis and treatment of chronic kidney disease."
"Instructions for Salvia miltiorrhiza polyphenol injections indicate abnormal liver function as an occasional adverse reaction, but the incidence of this adverse drug reaction (ADR) has increased in recent years. We assessed S. miltiorrhiza polyphenol ADRs by performing a nested case-control study(NCCS) and meta-analysis. In the NCCS, 2633 patients receiving this treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College were enrolled. Logistic regression models found that in 58 (2.2%) patients experiencing abnormal liver function, the risk for liver dysfunction was associated with sulfa drug allergy (OR = 7.874, 95%CI (1.280, 48.447), P = 0.026), payment methods (OR = 0.106, 95%CI (0.012, 0.934), P = 0.043), duration of administration (OR = 0.922, 95%CI (0.862, 0.986), P = 0.017), cefathiamidine (OR = 0.441, 95%CI (0.216, 0.900), P = 0.025), human serum albumin (OR = 1.958, 95%CI (1.011, 3.789), P = 0.046), Dazhu Rhodiola injection (OR = 2.599, 95%CI (1.112, 6.070), P = 0.027), or reduced glutathione (OR = 0.394, 95%CI (0.188, 0.826), P = 0.014). Meta-analysis of reports on S. miltiorrhiza polyphenol ADRs in controlled trials and other observational studies included 676 patients, of which 17 (2.17%; 95%CI (0.0105, 0.0358)) presented with liver dysfunction; associated ADR risk factors included co-administration of other drugs. Our NCCS and meta-analysis had similar ADR incidence rates, which were higher than the rate in the drug instructions. This study provides guidance for assessing liver dysfunction risks associated with S. miltiorrhiza polyphenol injections."
"The finding of novel molecular markers for prediction or prognosis of invasiveness in colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes an appealing challenge. Here we show the up-regulation of EPDR1 in a prospective cohort of 101 CRC patients, in a cDNA array of 43 patients and in in silico analyses. EPDR1 encodes a protein related to ependymins, a family of glycoproteins involved in intercellular contacts. A thorough statistical model allowed us to conclude that the gene is significantly up-regulated in tumour tissues when compared with normal mucosa. These results agree with those obtained by the analysis of three publicly available databases. EPDR1 up-regulation correlates with the TNM staging parameters, especially T and M. Studies with CRC cell lines revealed that the methylation of a CpG island controls EPDR1 expression. siRNA knocking-down and overexpression of the gene following transient plasmid transfection, showed that EPDR1 favours cell proliferation, migration, invasiveness and adhesion to type I collagen fibres, suggesting a role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Both statistical and functional analysis correlated EPDR1 overexpression with invasiveness and dissemination of tumour cells, supporting the inclusion of EPDR1 in panels of genes used to improve molecular subtyping of CRC. Eventually, EPDR1 may be an actionable target."
"Although temporary clipping of the parent artery is an indispensable technique in clipping surgery for intracranial aneurysms, the permissive duration of temporary clipping is still not well known. The aim of this study is to confirm the safety of precise motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring and to estimate the permissive duration of temporary clipping for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm based on precise MEP monitoring results. Under precise MEP monitoring via direct cortical stimulation every 30 seconds to 1 minute, surgeons released a temporary clip and waited for MEP amplitude to recover following severe (>50%) reduction of MEP amplitude during temporary clipping. Precise MEP monitoring was safely performed. Twenty-eight instances of temporary clipping were performed in 42 MCA aneurysm clipping surgeries. Because precise MEP monitoring could be used to determine when to release a temporary clip even with a severe reduction in MEP amplitude due to lengthy temporary clipping, no patients experienced permanent postoperative hemiparesis. Based on logistic regression analysis, if a temporary clip is applied for 312 seconds or more, there is a higher probability of a severe reduction in MEP amplitude. We should therefore release temporary clips after 5 minutes in order to avoid permanent postoperative hemiparesis."
"Beta-blockers (BB) have been traditionally associated with improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Whether they’re still efficacious in the post-reperfusion era is currently debated in the light of recent controversial reports. In-hospital, 6-month and 12-month mortality were studied in the GULF-COAST, a prospective multicenter cohort of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), in relation to BB use: prior to admission, 24-hour post-admission and on discharge in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%. On admission, 50.9% of the cohort participants had a LVEF ≥ 40%, of whom 1203 (55.4%) were on BB whilst 905 (44.6%) were not. Mean age was 60 (13) years old and 66% were males. Prior BB use or its administration in 24 hours decreased in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.25, 95% CI [0.09–0.67]; OR = 0.16, 95% CI [0.08–0.35]; respectively). BB on discharge lowered 1-month mortality (OR = 0.28, 95% CI [0.11–0.72]), but had a neutral effect on mortality, reinfarction and stroke at 6 and 12 months. Results were unchanged after multivariable adjustments and further sensitivity analysis. In this retrospective cohort of ACS, BB improved in-hospital and 1-month mortality in patients with a LVEF ≥ 40% but had a neutral effect on longer-term outcome."
"Left ventricular (LV) contraction is characterized by shortening and thickening of longitudinal and circumferential fibres. To date, it is poorly understood how LV deformation is altered in the pathogenesis of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus-associated diabetic cardiomyopathy and how this is associated with changes in cardiac structural composition. To gain further insights in these LV alterations, eight-week-old C57BL6/j mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg body weight STZ during 5 consecutive days. Six, 9, and 12 weeks (w) post injections, echocardiographic analysis was performed using a Vevo 3100 device coupled to a 30-MHz linear-frequency transducer. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) demonstrated impaired global longitudinal peak strain (GLS) in STZ versus control mice at all time points. 9w STZ animals displayed an impaired global circumferential peak strain (GCS) versus 6w and 12w STZ mice. They further exhibited decreased myocardial deformation behaviour of the anterior and posterior base versus controls, which was paralleled with an elevated collagen I/III protein ratio. Additionally, hypothesis-free proteome analysis by imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) identified regional- and time-dependent changes of proteins affecting sarcomere mechanics between STZ and control mice. In conclusion, STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy changes global cardiac deformation associated with alterations in cardiac sarcomere proteins."
"Radiomic features hold potential to improve prediction of disease-free survival (DFS) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and may show better performance if developed from TNBC patients. We aimed to develop a radiomics score based on MRI features to estimate DFS in patients with TNBC. A total of 228 TNBC patients who underwent preoperative MRI and surgery between April 2012 and December 2016 were included. Patients were temporally divided into the training (n = 169) and validation (n = 59) set. Radiomic features of the tumor were extracted from T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1- weighted MRI. Then a radiomics score was constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression in the training set. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine what associations the radiomics score and clinicopathologic variables had with DFS. A combined clinicopathologic-radiomic (CCR) model was constructed based on multivariate Cox analysis. The incremental values of the radiomics score were evaluated by using the integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC) and bootstrapping (n = 1000). The radiomics score, which consisted of 5 selected MRI features, was significantly associated with worse DFS in both the training and validation sets (p = 0.002, p = 0.033, respectively). In both the training and validation set, the radiomics score showed comparable performance with the clinicopathologic model. The CCR model demonstrated better performance than the clinicopathologic model in the training set (iAUC, 0.844; difference in iAUC, p < 0.001) and validation set (iAUC, 0.765, difference in iAUC, p < 0.001). In conclusion, MRI-based radiomic features can improve the prediction of DFS when integrated with clinicopathologic data in patients with TNBC."
"A critical limitation of Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) as an anti-cancer agent is the loss of their invasive or replicative activities, which results in no or less delivery of anti-cancer agents inside cancer cells in cancer therapy. Here we developed an oxytolerant attenuated Salmonella strain (KST0650) from the parental KST0649 (ΔptsIΔcrr) strain using radiation mutation technology (RMT). The oxytolerant KST0650 strain possessed 20-times higher replication activity in CT26 cancer cells and was less virulent than KST0649. Furthermore, KST0650 migrated effectively into tumor tissues in mice. KST0650 was further equipped with a plasmid harboring a spliced form of the intracellular pro-apoptotic protein sATF6, and the expression of sATF6 was controlled by the radiation-inducible recN promoter. The new strain was named as KST0652, in which sATF6 protein expression was induced in response to radiation in a dose-dependent manner. This strain was effectively delivered inside cancer cells and tumor tissues via the Salmonella type III secretion system (T3SS). In addition, combination treatment with KST0652 and radiation showed a synergistic anti-tumor effect in murine tumor model with complete inhibition of tumor growth and protection against death. In conclusion, we showed that RMT can be used to effectively develop an anti-tumor Salmonella strain for delivering anti-cancer agents inside tumors."
"0.5–1% of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with mutations in the angiogenin (ANG). These mutations are thought to cause disease through a loss of ANG function, but this hypothesis has not been evaluated statistically. In addition, the potential for ANG to promote disease has not been considered. With the goal of better defining the etiology of ANG-ALS, we assembled all clinical onset and disease duration data and determined if these were correlated with biochemical properties of ANG variants. Loss of ANG stability and ribonuclease activity were found to correlate with early ALS onset, confirming an aspect of the prevailing model of ANG-ALS. Conversely, loss of ANG stability and ribonuclease activity correlated with longer survival following diagnosis, which is inconsistent with the prevailing model. These results indicate that functional ANG appears to decrease the risk of developing ALS but exacerbate ALS once in progress. These findings are rationalized in terms of studies demonstrating that distinct mechanisms contribute to ALS onset and progression and propose that ANG replacement or stabilization would benefit pre-symptomatic ANG-ALS patients. However, this study challenges the prevailing hypothesis that augmenting ANG will benefit symptomatic ANG-ALS patients. Instead, our results suggest that silencing of ANG activity may be beneficial for symptomatic ALS patients. This study will serve as a call-to-arms for neurologists to consistently publish ALS and PD patient's clinical data—if all ANG-ALS patients’ data were available our findings could be tested with considerable statistical power."
"Social interaction deficits are evident in many psychiatric conditions and specifically in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but hard to assess objectively. We present a digital tool to automatically quantify biomarkers of social interaction deficits: the simulated interaction task (SIT), which entails a standardized 7-min simulated dialog via video and the automated analysis of facial expressions, gaze behavior, and voice characteristics. In a study with 37 adults with ASD without intellectual disability and 43 healthy controls, we show the potential of the tool as a diagnostic instrument and for better description of ASD-associated social phenotypes. Using machine-learning tools, we detected individuals with ASD with an accuracy of 73%, sensitivity of 67%, and specificity of 79%, based on their facial expressions and vocal characteristics alone. Especially reduced social smiling and facial mimicry as well as a higher voice fundamental frequency and harmony-to-noise-ratio were characteristic for individuals with ASD. The time-effective and cost-effective computer-based analysis outperformed a majority vote and performed equal to clinical expert ratings."
"Reliable approaches to identify stem cell mechanisms that mediate aggressive cancer could have great therapeutic value, based on the growing evidence of embryonic signatures in metastatic cancers. However, how to best identify and target stem-like mechanisms aberrantly acquired by cancer cells has been challenging. We harnessed the power of reprogramming to examine GRP78, a chaperone protein generally restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum in normal tissues, but which is expressed on the cell surface of human embryonic stem cells and many cancer types. We have discovered that (1) cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) is expressed on iPSCs and is important in reprogramming, (2) sGRP78 promotes cellular functions in both pluripotent and breast cancer cells (3) overexpression of GRP78 in breast cancer cells leads to an induction of a CD24−/CD44+ tumor initiating cell (TIC) population (4) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells are enriched for stemness genes and appear to be a subset of TICs (5) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells show an enhanced ability to seed metastatic organ sites in vivo. These collective findings show that GRP78 has important functions in regulating both pluripotency and oncogenesis, and suggest that sGRP78 marks a stem-like population in breast cancer cells that has increased metastatic potential in vivo."
"Primary motor cortex (M1) infarctions sometimes cause sensory impairment. Because sensory signals play a vital role in motor control, sensory impairment compromises the recovery and rehabilitation of motor disability. However, the neural mechanism of the sensory impairment is poorly understood. We show that sensory processing in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was impaired in the acute phase of M1 infarctions and recovered in a layer-specific manner in the subacute phase. This layer-dependent recovery process and the anatomical connection pattern from M1 to S1 suggested that functional connectivity from M1 to S1 plays a key role in the sensory processing impairment. A simulation study demonstrated that the loss of inhibition from M1 to S1 in the acute phase of M1 infarctions could impair sensory processing in S1, and compensation for the inhibition could recover the temporal coding. Consistently, the optogenetic activation of M1 suppressed the sustained response in S1. Taken together, we revealed how focal stroke in M1 alters the cortical network activity of sensory processing, in which inhibitory input from M1 to S1 may be involved."
"This study was a second multicenter trial on childhood ALL by the Japan Childhood Leukemia Study Group (JACLS) to improve outcomes in non-T ALL. Between April 2002 and March 2008, 1138 children with non-T ALL were enrolled in the JACLS ALL-02 trial. Patients were stratified into three groups using age, white blood cell count, unfavorable genetic abnormalities, and treatment response: standard risk (SR), high risk (HR), and extremely high risk (ER). Prophylactic cranial radiation therapy (PCRT) was abolished except for CNS leukemia. Four-year event-free survival (4yr-EFS) and 4-year overall survival (4yr-OS) rates for all patients were 85.4% ± 1.1% and 91.2% ± 0.9%, respectively. Risk-adjusted therapy resulted in 4yr-EFS rates of 90.4% ± 1.4% for SR, 84.9% ± 1.6% for HR, and 66.5% ± 4.0% for ER. Based on NCI risk classification, 4yr-EFS rates were 88.2% in NCI-SR and 76.4% in NCI-HR patients, respectively. Compared to previous trial ALL-97, 4yr-EFS of NCI-SR patients was significantly improved (88.2% vs 81.2%, log rank p = 0.0004). The 4-year cumulative incidence of isolated (0.9%) and total (1.5%) CNS relapse were significantly lower than those reported previously. In conclusion, improved EFS in NCI-SR patients and abolish of PCRT was achieved in ALL-02."
"The incidence of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration disease, caused by changes in the osmotic pressure of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, increases with age. In general, low back pain is associated with IVD degeneration. However, the mechanism and molecular target of low back pain have not been elucidated, and there are no data suggesting specific biomarkers of low back pain. Therefore, the research aims to identify and verify the significant gene biomarkers of low back pain. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the identification and analysis of significant gene biomarkers were also performed with various bioinformatics programs. A total of 120 patients with low back pain were recruited. Before surgery, the degree of pain was measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS), which enables comparison of the pain scores from individuals. After surgery, IVD tissues were obtained, and NP cells were isolated. The NP cells were cultured in two various osmotic media, including iso-osmotic media (293 mOsm/kg H2O) to account for the morbid environment of NP cells in IVD degeneration disease and hyper-osmotic media (450 mOsm/kg H2O) to account for the normal condition of NP cells in healthy individuals. The relative mRNA expression levels of CCL5, OPRL1, CXCL13, and SST were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in the in vitro analysis of the osmotic pressure experiments. Finally, correlation analysis and a neural network module were employed to explore the linkage between significant gene biomarkers and pain. A total of 371 DEGs were identified, including 128 downregulated genes and 243 upregulated genes. Furthermore, the four genes (CCL5, OPRL1, SST, and CXCL13) were identified as significant gene biomarkers of low back pain (P < 0.001) based on univariate linear regression, and CCL5 (odds ratio, 34.667; P = 0.003) and OPRL1 (odds ratio, 19.875; P < 0.001) were significantly related to low back pain through multivariate logistic regression. The expression of CCL5 and OPRL1 might be correlated with low back pain in patients with IVD degeneration disease caused by changes in the osmotic pressure of NP cells."
"Hypercholesterolemia accelerates the phenotypes of aging in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). As yet, little is known about the underlying mechanism. We found that hypercholesterolemia downregulates Ten eleven translocation 1 (Tet1) in HSCs. The total HSC population was increased, while the long-term (LT) population, side population and reconstitution capacity of HSCs were significantly decreased in Tet1−/− mice. Expression of the Tet1 catalytic domain in HSCs effectively restored the LT population and reconstitution capacity of HSCs isolated from Tet1−/− mice. While Tet1 deficiency upregulated the expression of p19 and p21 in HSCs by decreasing the H3K27me3 modification, the restoration of Tet1 activity reduced the expression of p19, p21 and p27 by restoring the H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 modifications on these genes. These results indicate that Tet1 plays a critical role in maintaining the quiescence and reconstitution capacity of HSCs and that hypercholesterolemia accelerates HSC aging phenotypes by decreasing Tet1 expression in HSCs."
"Macropinocytic cancer cells scavenge amino acids from extracellular proteins. Here, we show that consuming necrotic cell debris via macropinocytosis (necrocytosis) offers additional anabolic benefits. A click chemistry-based flux assay reveals that necrocytosis provides not only amino acids, but sugars, fatty acids and nucleotides for biosynthesis, conferring resistance to therapies targeting anabolic pathways. Indeed, necrotic cell debris allow macropinocytic breast and prostate cancer cells to proliferate, despite fatty acid synthase inhibition. Standard therapies such as gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin and gamma-irradiation directly or indirectly target nucleotide biosynthesis, creating stress that is relieved by scavenged nucleotides. Strikingly, necrotic debris also render macropinocytic, but not non-macropinocytic, pancreas and breast cancer cells resistant to these treatments. Selective, genetic inhibition of macropinocytosis confirms that necrocytosis both supports tumor growth and limits the effectiveness of 5-FU in vivo. Therefore, this study establishes necrocytosis as a mechanism for drug resistance."
"Endometrial cancer (EC) is the sixth most common cancer in women. Since early EC has a good prognosis, identifying methods for early diagnosis is valuable. Here, we aimed to study the role of HDAC6, which has been indicated important in many kinds of cancers, in EC diagnosis and therapy. First, the expression levels of HDAC6 in EC tissues and cells were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and through bioinformatics and dual luciferase assays, HDAC6 was found to be a direct target of miR-206. Then, CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell assays were performed; these results indicated that HDAC6 promoted EC cell proliferation, metastasis and invasion, while miR-206 produced the opposite effects. In addition, rescue assays verified that the effect of miR-206 could be reversed by HDAC6, and global gene expression analysis confirmed the relationship between miR-206 and HDAC6. Finally, we measured the levels of PTEN, p-AKT and p-mTOR and other key molecules and speculated that miR-206 might target HDAC6 to suppress EC progression via the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, downregulation of miR-206 and upregulation of HDAC6 in EC may predict poor prognosis, and as the target gene of miR-206, HDAC achieves its carcinogenic effect through the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway."
"We conducted DNA methylation association analyses using Illumina 450K data from whole blood for an Australian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) case–control cohort (782 cases and 613 controls). Analyses used mixed linear models as implemented in the OSCA software. We found a significantly higher proportion of neutrophils in cases compared to controls which replicated in an independent cohort from the Netherlands (1159 cases and 637 controls). The OSCA MOMENT linear mixed model has been shown in simulations to best account for confounders. When combined in a methylation profile score, the 25 most-associated probes identified by MOMENT significantly classified case–control status in the Netherlands sample (area under the curve, AUC = 0.65, CI95% = [0.62–0.68], p = 8.3 × 10−22). The maximum AUC achieved was 0.69 (CI95% = [0.66–0.71], p = 4.3 × 10−34) when cell-type proportion was included in the predictor."
"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clinically and biologically heterogenous event that accounts for approximately 10% of all hematological malignancies. Chromosome 1 open reading frame 35 (C1orf35) is a gene cloned and identified in our laboratory from a MM cell line (GenBank: AY137773), but little is known about its function. In the current study, we have confirmed that C1orf35 is a candidate oncogene, and it can promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S. Later, we found that C1orf35 is able to affect the cell proliferation by modulating the expression of c-MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog), and the oncogenic property of C1orf35 can be rescued by c-MYC inhibition. Herein, we found positive association between C1orf35 and c-MYC in MM patients and in MM cell lines. The correlation analysis of the genes coamplified in MM patients from GEO datasets showed a correlation between C1orf35 and c-MYC, and the expression data of different stages of plasma cell neoplasm acquired from GEO datasets showed that the expression of C1orf35 increase with the progression of the disease. This indicates that C1orf35 may play a role in the disease progression. Moreover, C1orf35 can modulate c-MYC expression and rescue c-MYC transcription inhibited by Act D. Finally, we have shown that C1orf35 activates c-MYC transcription by binding to the i-motif of Nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 (NHE III1) in the c-MYC promoter. Not only does our current study advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis and therapeutic landscape of MM, but also of other cancer types and diseases that are initiated with deregulated c-MYC transcription."
"Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) can spread beyond the sinonasal cavity. It is necessary to analyze the association between the specific site involved in the extrasinonasal area and the survival rate to predict patient prognosis. We investigated 50 patients who had extrasinonasal lesions on preoperative gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and underwent wide surgical resection of AIFRS. The specific sites with loss of contrast enhancement (LoCE) on Gd-enhanced MRI were analyzed for AIFRS-specific survival rate. The most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus followed by hematological malignancy. The most common symptoms were headache and facial pain. Seven patients (14.0%) expired because of AIFRS progression. Poor prognosis was independently associated with LoCE at the skull base on preoperative MRI (HR = 35.846, P = 0.004). In patients with AIFRS extending to the extrasinonasal area, LoCE at the skull base was an independent poor prognostic factor."
"Despite the resounding clinical success in cancer treatment of antibodies that block the interaction of PD1 with its ligand PDL11, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. A major limitation to understanding the origin and fate of T cells in tumour immunity is the lack of quantitative information on the distribution of individual clonotypes of T cells in patients with cancer. Here, by performing deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors in patients with different types of cancer, we survey the profiles of various populations of T cells and T cell receptors in tumours, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood. We find clear evidence of clonotypic expansion of effector-like T cells not only within the tumour but also in normal adjacent tissue. Patients with gene signatures of such clonotypic expansion respond best to anti-PDL1 therapy. Notably, expanded clonotypes found in the tumour and normal adjacent tissue can also typically be detected in peripheral blood, which suggests a convenient approach to patient identification. Analyses of our data together with several external datasets suggest that intratumoural T cells, especially in responsive patients, are replenished with fresh, non-exhausted replacement cells from sites outside the tumour, suggesting continued activity of the cancer immunity cycle in these patients, the acceleration of which may be associated with clinical response."
"This study aimed to clarify how masticatory muscle atrophy induced by botulinum toxin (BTX) injection affects cortical bone quality of the mandible using 3D modeling technology. A total of 39 young (26.9 ± 6.0 years) and 38 post-menopausal (55.3 ± 6.3 years) females were included. Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained before and after 12 months of treatment. Predictor variables were application of a stabilization splint, and/or two times of BTX injection in the bilateral temporalis and masseter muscles within a six-month interval. Outcome variables were changes in average Hounsfield units (HU) and cortical thickness of region of interest (ROI). 3D mandibular models were reconstructed using CT images, and models were used to calculate average HU and cortical thickness of ROIs, including inferior half of the lateral surface of ascending ramus, coronoid process, and temporomandibular joint condyle. Cortical bone quality at muscle insertion site was influenced by decreased muscle thickness but seemed not to be affected by decreased functional loading. Reduced functional loading seemed to influence cortical bone quality of the condyles. These effects were more remarkable in post-menopausal females. Hence, decreased masticatory muscle thickness may lead to alterations of the mandibular cortical structures, especially in post-menopausal females."
"A ketamine/xylazine (K/X) mixture is widely used before and during experiments in rodents. However, the impact of short-term use of K/X mixture and its influences on data interpretation have rarely been discussed. In this study, we administered one shot of a K/X mixture and examined acute hepatic responses using biochemical analysis, histopathological examination, and non-invasive imaging to determine the delay required prior to further assessment of the liver to avoid confounding effects triggered by anaesthesia. After the K/X injection, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum was significantly elevated from 3 to 48 h. Obstructed sinusoidal circulation lasting for 24 or 36 h was revealed by DCE-MRI and drug distribution analysis, respectively. Metabolic alterations were detected at 3 h by NMR analysis and FDG-PET. Moreover, ultrasonography showed that lipid droplet accumulation increased from 1 to 16 h and declined thereafter. Taken together, our findings show that the K/X mixture induces acute hepatotoxicity and metabolic disturbance, and these disturbances cause hemodynamical disorders in the liver. The required time interval for recovery from K/X impact was dependent on the chosen assay. It took at least 16 h for metabolic recovery and 36 h for recovery of sinusoidal circulation. However, the liver was not fully recovered from the injury within 48 h."
"Pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain (POGZ) has been identified as one of the most recurrently de novo mutated genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and White-Sutton syndrome; however, the neurobiological basis behind these disorders remains unknown. Here, we show that POGZ regulates neuronal development and that ASD-related de novo mutations impair neuronal development in the developing mouse brain and induced pluripotent cell lines from an ASD patient. We also develop the first mouse model heterozygous for a de novo POGZ mutation identified in a patient with ASD, and we identify ASD-like abnormalities in the mice. Importantly, social deficits can be treated by compensatory inhibition of elevated cell excitability in the mice. Our results provide insight into how de novo mutations on high-confidence ASD genes lead to impaired mature cortical network function, which underlies the cellular pathogenesis of NDDs, including ASD."
"Several patients with thyroid cancer experience symptom distress after diagnosis and surgery. Data on the association between symptomatology and disease recurrence are limited. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed, and 57 patients who had recurrence after operation of differentiated thyroid cancer were identified. Controlling for age, sex, surgery, and tumour stage, 114 patients without recurrent disease were selected by case-control matching. Subjective symptoms at follow-up visits were extracted from medical records and classified into three symptom clusters: pharyngolaryngeal, psychoneurological, and gastrointestinal. Compared to the control group, patients with recurrence had higher symptom totals in the pharyngolaryngeal (P < 0.001) and psychoneurological clusters (P = 0.005). Symptom score >3 yielded a sensitivity of 61.4% and a specificity of 80.7% to predict recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high symptom score (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.184), family history of thyroid cancer (HR = 2.463), and obesity (HR = 1.981) were independently associated with disease recurrence. Taken together, the likelihood of postoperative recurrence seemed to increase with high self-perceived symptom burden, family history, and obesity in patients with thyroid cancer. The results could be applied to the recurrence surveillance and symptomatic management of thyroid cancer post-operation."
"Anterior circulation large artery occlusion (AC-LAO) related acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is particularly common in clinics in China. We retrospectively analyzed 787 consecutively hospitalized AIS patients with AC-LAO in Hebei Province, China. AC-LAO was defined as a complete occlusion of at least one intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) based on computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography. Among eight subtypes of AC-LAO, unilateral MCA occlusion is the most common one (49.8%, n = 392), while bilateral ICA/unilateral MCA occlusion is the least (0.3%, n = 2). Compared with unilateral MCA and unilateral ICA occlusion, patients with tandem ICA/MCA and bilateral ICA/MCA occlusion had poor outcomes after suffering AIS. Age (OR 1.022; 95%CI, 1.007 to 1.036) was an independent risk factor for single artery progressed to multiple artery occlusion, while ApoA1 (OR 0.453; 95% CI, 0.235 to 0.953) was a protective factor. Patients with unilateral MCA occlusion were prone to artery-to-artery embolism infarction subtype, unilateral ICA occlusion group were the most vulnerable to hypoperfusion/impaired emboli clearance subtype. Our results suggested various AC-LAO subtypes have different clinical characteristics and prognosis and were prone to different subtypes of infarction. Customized preventive measures based on AC-LAO subtypes may be more targeted preventions of stroke recurrences for AIS patients and could improve their prognoses."
"ObjectiveTo evaluate whether treated hypotension in the first 24 postnatal hours is associated with hearing loss in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.Study designIn a cohort of 735 ELBW infants, we identified 25 with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) at 12–24 months adjusted age. For each case, we selected three controls with normal hearing. Logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounding variables.ResultsSixty percent of cases and 25% of controls were treated for hypotension. After adjusting for confounding variables (gestational age, antenatal glucocorticoids, 5 min Apgar < 6, insertion of an umbilical catheter, treatment with high frequency ventilation, and major cranial ultrasound abnormality), treated hypotension was associated with an increased risk of SNHL (adjusted odds ratio: 3.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.3–9.7).ConclusionsTreated hypotension in ELBW infants in the first 24 h of life is associated with an increased risk of SNHL."
"Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by Huntingtin (Htt) gene mutation resulting in the loss of striatal GABAergic neurons and motor functional deficits. We report here an in vivo cell conversion technology to reprogram striatal astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in both R6/2 and YAC128 HD mouse models through AAV-mediated ectopic expression of NeuroD1 and Dlx2 transcription factors. We found that the astrocyte-to-neuron (AtN) conversion rate reached 80% in the striatum and >50% of the converted neurons were DARPP32+ medium spiny neurons. The striatal astrocyte-converted neurons showed action potentials and synaptic events, and projected their axons to the targeted globus pallidus and substantia nigra in a time-dependent manner. Behavioral analyses found that NeuroD1 and Dlx2-treated R6/2 mice showed a significant extension of life span and improvement of motor functions. This study demonstrates that in vivo AtN conversion may be a disease-modifying gene therapy to treat HD and other neurodegenerative disorders."
"Tissue repair after spinal cord injury requires the mobilization of immune and glial cells to form a protective barrier that seals the wound and facilitates debris clearing, inflammatory containment and matrix compaction. This process involves corralling, wherein phagocytic immune cells become confined to the necrotic core, which is surrounded by an astrocytic border. Here we elucidate a temporally distinct gene signature in injury-activated microglia and macrophages (IAMs) that engages axon guidance pathways. Plexin-B2 is upregulated in IAMs and is required for motor sensory recovery after spinal cord injury. Plexin-B2 deletion in myeloid cells impairs corralling, leading to diffuse tissue damage, inflammatory spillover and hampered axon regeneration. Corralling begins early and requires Plexin-B2 in both microglia and macrophages. Mechanistically, Plexin-B2 promotes microglia motility, steers IAMs away from colliding cells and facilitates matrix compaction. Our data therefore establish Plexin-B2 as an important link that integrates biochemical cues and physical interactions of IAMs with the injury microenvironment during wound healing."
"For the past few decades, tissue sealants and adhesives have been developed as an alternative to sutures and staples to close and seal wounds or incisions. These materials are advantageous because of their ease of use, short application time and minimal tissue damage, making them suitable for minimally invasive procedures. However, there is a large gap between the amount of research into tissue adhesives and the number of products available. To bridge this gap, there is a need to better understand the challenges to clinical translation of tissue adhesives. In particular, adhesive design must be informed by a deep understanding of the target tissue’s surface characteristics and environment, which vary considerably among tissue types. Moreover, understanding and monitoring the long-term performance of a material post-implantation is crucial; this includes monitoring the chemical and physical properties of the implanted adhesives over time, tissue responses and the resultant changes in adhesion and cohesion. In addition, early-stage consideration of the unmet clinical need and the regulatory and development paths could lower the barriers in the development cost and effort, facilitating clinical translation. In this Review, we identify challenges in the development of tissue adhesives and provide design criteria to translate tissue-adhesive technologies into clinical practice."
"Phosphocreatine (PCr) plays a vital role in neuron and myocyte energy homeostasis. Currently, there are no routine diagnostic tests to noninvasively map PCr distribution with clinically relevant spatial resolution and scan time. Here, we demonstrate that artificial neural network-based chemical exchange saturation transfer (ANNCEST) can be used to rapidly quantify PCr concentration with robust immunity to commonly seen MRI interferences. High-quality PCr mapping of human skeletal muscle, as well as the information of exchange rate, magnetic field and radio-frequency transmission inhomogeneities, can be obtained within 1.5 min on a 3 T standard MRI scanner using ANNCEST. For further validation, we apply ANNCEST to measure the PCr concentrations in exercised skeletal muscle. The ANNCEST outcomes strongly correlate with those from 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (R = 0.813, p < 0.001, t test). These results suggest that ANNCEST has potential as a cost-effective and widely available method for measuring PCr and diagnosing related diseases."
"There is concern among residents that their children might suffer from thyroid cancer in the near future after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station (FDNPS) accident. However, the demographic and geographical distribution of thyroid equivalent doses was not thoroughly evaluated, and direct thyroid measurements were conducted only for 1,200 children, whose individual thyroid doses were assessed on the basis of those measurements accounting for the dynamics of radioiodine intake. We conducted hierarchical clustering analyses of 100 or 300 randomly sampled behavioural questionnaire sheets of children from each of seven municipalities in the evacuation area to reconstruct evacuation scenarios associated with high or low exposures to plumes. In total 896 behaviour records in the Fukushima Health Management Survey were analysed to estimate thyroid equivalent doses via inhalation, using a spatiotemporal radionuclides concentration database constructed by atmospheric dispersion simulations. After a decontamination factor for sheltering and a modifying factor for the dose coefficient—to reflect lower iodine uptake rate in Japanese—were applied, estimated thyroid equivalent doses were close to those estimated from direct thyroid measurement. The median and 95th percentile of thyroid equivalent doses of 1-year-old children ranged from 0.6 to 16 mSv and from 7.5 to 30 mSv, respectively. These results are useful for future epidemiological studies of thyroid cancer in Fukushima."
"Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs) have been widely used in the treatment of malignant central airway obstruction. However, few reports focus on the treatment of atelectasis and how to estimate the prior probability of success via SEMSs placement, This current study aimed to study the safety and effectiveness of SEMSs for the treatment of obstructive atelectasis, and the value of preoperative CT enhancement for ventilation of atelectasis via SEMSs placement. A total of 35 patients with obstructive atelectasis (29 male and 6 female) was included from February 2012 to March 2018. The procedures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and bronchoscopic laser resection was performed for severe restenosis cases after SEMSs placement. Clinical and functional pulmonary data were recorded before and 3 months after the procedure. Follow-up involved clinical data and radiographic techniques at 48 h and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Thirty-eight SEMSs were successfully implanted in 34 patients, included 29 Y type tracheal stents, 4 small y stents, and 5 straight airway stents. After stenting, 26 cases showed full ventilation, and 3 cases were partially ventilated. The technical success and clinical success was 97.1% and 82.9%, respectively. A higher maximum enhancement CT value was found in patients with full ventilation. Mean follow-up time was 18.8 ± 4.0 months. Eight cases showed restenosis and received endoscopic laser resection, included 1 case underwent removal and 3 cases received second stenting. There were 2 cases of perioperative non-operative death, and 11 cases of post-discharge death (2 cardiac deaths and 9 malignant tumors). The survival rates of 3 months, 1 year and 2 years were 78.6%, 58.5% and 58.5%, respectively. In conclusion, SEMSs placement is safe and effective for obstructive atelectasis, and the preoperative CT enhancement played an important role in estimating the prior probability of success in the treatment of atelectasis via SEMSs placement."
"Hartmann’s reversal procedures are often fraught with complications or failure to recover. This being a fact, it is often difficult to select patients with the optimal indications for a reversal. The post-recovery morbidity and mortality rates in the literature are heterogeneous between 0.8 and 44%. The identification of predictive risk factors of failure of such interventions would therefore be very useful to help the practitioner in his approach. Given these elements, it was important to us to analyze the practice of two French university hospitals in order to highlight such risk factors and to allow surgeons to select the best therapeutic strategy. We performed a bicentric observational retrospective study between 2010 and 2015 that studied the characteristics of patients who had undergone Hartmann surgery and were subsequently reestablished. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing morbidity and postoperative mortality of Hartmann’s reversal. Primary outcome was complications within the first 90 postoperative days. 240 patients were studied of which 60.4% were men. The mean age was 69.48 years. The median time to reversal was 8 months. 79.17% of patients were operated as emergency cases where the indication was a diverticular complication (39.17%). Seventy patients (29.2%) underwent a reversal and approximately 43% of these had complications within the first 90 postoperative days. The mean age of these seventy patients was 61.3 years old and 65.7% were males. None of them benefited from a reversal in the first three months. We identified some risk factors for morbidity such as pre-operative low albuminemia (p = 0.005) and moderate renal impairment (p = 0.019). However, chronic corticosteroid use (p = 0.004), moderate renal insufficiency (p = 0.014) and coronary artery disease (p = 0.014) seem to favour the development of anastomotic fistula, which is itself, a risk factor for mortality (p = 0.007). Our study highlights an important rate of complications including significant anastomotic fistula after Hartmann’s reversal. Precarious nutritional status and cardiovascular comorbidities should clearly lead us to reconsider the surgical indication for continuity restoration."
"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) acetylator status can be classified into three groups depending on the number of rapid alleles (e.g., NAT2*4): rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylators. Such acetylator status may influence the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during sulfasalazine treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between NAT2 acetylator status and ADRs of sulfasalazine. We searched for qualified studies in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the association between NAT2 acetylator status and ADRs of sulfasalazine. Nine cohort studies involving 1,077 patients were included in the meta-analysis. NAT2 slow acetylators were associated with an increase in overall ADRs (OR 3.37, 95% CI: 1.43 to 7.93; p = 0.005), discontinuation due to overall ADRs (OR 2.89, 95% CI: 1.72 to 4.86; p < 0.0001), and dose-related ADRs (OR 5.20, 95% CI: 2.44 to 11.08; p < 0.0001), compared with rapid and intermediate acetylators. In conclusion, NAT2 slow acetylators are at risk of ADRs during sulfasalazine treatment. Based on our findings, NAT2 genotyping may be useful to predict the occurrence of ADRs during sulfasalazine treatment."
"Aiming to increase the reproducibility of biomedical research results, biobanks obtain human tissues of the highest quality and carry out different storage methods adapted to the needs of analytical technique to be performed by the biomedical researchers. However, there is much controversy and little data concerning the real impact of different stabilization methods on tissue quality, integrity and functionality of derived biomolecules. The influence of four stabilization methods [RNAlater (RNL), snap freezing (SF), snap freezing using Optimal Cutting Tissue compound (SF-OCT) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)] on RNA quality and integrity was evaluated in paired samples of lung tissue. RNA integrity was evaluated through PCR-endpoint assays amplifying six fragments of different length of the HPRT1 gene and RNA Integrity Number (RIN). To evaluate the difference of tissue functionality among the stabilization methods tested, RT-qPCRs were performed focusing on the differential expression of the HPRT1, SNRPD3 and Jun genes. RNA from the samples preserved with the RNL or SF-OCT method showed better integrity compared to SF and FFPE, measured by PCR-endpoint and RT-qPCR assays. However, only statistically significant differences were observed between the RNA from FFPE and other stabilization methods when gene expression of HPRT1, SNRPD3 and Jun housekeeping genes were determined by RT-qPCR. For the three mentioned genes, Cq and RIN values were highly correlated. The present work describes the fragility of SF samples, being critical the moment just before RNA extraction, although further experiments of tissue RNA are needed. Standardization pre-analytic workflow can lead to improved reproducibility between biomedical research studies. The present study demonstrated clear evidences about the impact of the stabilization method on RNA derived from lung human tissue samples."
"Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic depression) is a severe disorder. Compared with other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, relatively few studies on the neurobiology of psychotic depression have been pursued. Neuroimaging studies investigating psychotic depression have provided evidence for distributed structural brain abnormalities implicating the insular cortex and limbic system. We examined structural brain networks in participants (N = 245) using magnetic resonance imaging. This sample included healthy controls (n = 159) and the largest cross-sectional sample of patients with remitted psychotic depression (n = 86) collected to date. All patients participated in the Study of Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression II randomized controlled trial. We used a novel, whole-brain, data-driven parcellation technique—non-negative matrix factorization—and applied it to cortical thickness data to derive structural covariance networks. We compared patients with remitted psychotic depression to healthy controls and found that patients had significantly thinner cortex in five structural covariance networks (insular-limbic, occipito-temporal, temporal, parahippocampal-limbic, and inferior fronto-temporal), confirming our hypothesis that affected brain networks would incorporate cortico-limbic regions. We also found that cross-sectional depression and severity scores at the time of scanning were associated with the insular-limbic network. Furthermore, the insular-limbic network predicted future severity scores that were collected at the time of recurrence of psychotic depression or sustained remission. Overall, decreased cortical thickness was found in five structural brain networks in patients with remitted psychotic depression and brain-behavior relationships were observed, particularly between the insular-limbic network and illness severity."
"Physical activity (PA) has been hypothesized to be effective to maintaining cognitive function and delay cognitive decline in the elderly, but physical fitness (PF) could be a better predictor of cognitive function. We aimed to study the association between PA and PF with cognitive function and quality of life using cross-sectional data from 6874 participants of the PREDIMED-Plus trial (64.9 ± 4.9 years, 48.5% female). PF and PA were measured with a Chair Stand Test, the REGICOR and Rapid Assessment Physical Activity questionnaires. Cognitive function was measured with Mini-mental State Examination, Control Oral Word Association Test, Trail Making Test and Digit Span tests; whereas health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF36-HRQL test. Cognitive and quality of life scores were compared among PF quartiles and PA levels (low, moderate and high) with ANCOVA and with Chair Stand repetitions and energy expenditure from total PA with multivariable linear regression adjusted for confounding factors. PF associated with higher scores in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tests and with lower TMT A time. However, PA was not associated with the neurocognitive parameters evaluated. Both PF and PA levels were strongly associated with a better quality of life. We concluded that PF, but not PA, is associated with a better cognitive function. This trial was retrospectively registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (ISRCTN89898870, https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89898870?q=ISRCTN89898870&filters=&sort=&offset=1&totalResults=1&page=1&pageSize=10&searchType=basic-search) on 07/24/2014."
"The Mucin 1 (MUC1) protein is overexpressed in various cancers and mediates chemotherapy resistance. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. Given that most chemotherapeutic drugs disrupt ER homeostasis as part of their toxicity, and MUC1 expression is regulated by proteins involved in ER homeostasis, we investigated the link between MUC1 and ER homeostasis. MUC1 knockdown in pancreatic cancer cells enhanced unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and cell death upon ER stress induction. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations in the pyrimidine metabolic pathway and cytidine deaminase (CDA). ChIP and CDA activity assays showed that MUC1 occupied CDA gene promoter upon ER stress induction correlating with increased CDA expression and activity in MUC1-expressing cells as compared with MUC1 knockdown cells. Inhibition of either the CDA or pyrimidine metabolic pathway diminished survival in MUC1-expressing cancer cells upon ER stress induction. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that MUC1-mediated CDA activity corresponded to deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine metabolic reprogramming upon ER stress induction. The resulting increase in deoxyuridine mitigated ER stress-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, given (1) the established roles of MUC1 in protecting cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) insults, (2) ER stress-generated ROS further promote ER stress and (3) the emerging anti-oxidant property of deoxyuridine, we further investigated if MUC1 regulated ER stress by a deoxyuridine-mediated modulation of ROS levels. We observed that deoxyuridine could abrogate ROS-induced ER stress to promote cancer cell survival. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel MUC1-CDA axis of the adaptive UPR that provides survival advantage upon ER stress induction."
"Although metabolic syndrome (MS) is a significant risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the cardiac response (MR) to MS remains unclear due to traditional MS models’ narrow scope around a limited number of cell-cycle regulation biomarkers and drawbacks of limited human tissue samples. To date, we developed the most comprehensive platform studying MR to MS in a pig model tightly related to human MS criteria. By incorporating comparative metabolomic, transcriptomic, functional analyses, and unsupervised machine learning (UML), we can discover unknown metabolic pathways connections and links on numerous biomarkers across the MS-associated issues in the heart. For the first time, we show severely diminished availability of glycolytic and citric acid cycle (CAC) pathways metabolites, altered expression, GlcNAcylation, and activity of involved enzymes. A notable exception, however, is the excessive succinate accumulation despite reduced succinate dehydrogenase complex iron-sulfur subunit b (SDHB) expression and decreased content of precursor metabolites. Finally, the expression of metabolites and enzymes from the GABA-glutamate, GABA-putrescine, and the glyoxylate pathways significantly increase, suggesting an alternative cardiac means to replenish succinate and malate in MS. Our platform discovers potential therapeutic targets for MS-associated CVD within pathways that were previously unknown to corelate with the disease."
"Heart failure is a major public health problem affecting over 23 million people worldwide. In this study, we present the results of a large scale meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS and replication in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel loci associated with heart failure. Heart failure sub-phenotyping shows that a new locus in chromosome 1 is associated with left ventricular adverse remodeling and clinical heart failure, in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Functional characterization and fine-mapping of that locus reveal a putative causal variant in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region activated during cardiomyocyte differentiation that binds to the ACTN2 gene, a crucial structural protein inside the cardiac sarcolemma (Hi-C interaction p-value = 0.00002). Genome-editing in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes confirms the influence of the identified regulatory region in the expression of ACTN2. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying heart failure."
"Seasonal differences in mood and depressive symptoms affect a large percentage of the general population, with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) representing the most common presentation. SAD affects up to 3% of the world’s population, and it tends to be more predominant in females than males. The brainstem has been shown to be affected by photoperiodic changes, and that longer photoperiods are associated with higher neuronal density and decreased depressive-like behaviours. We predict that longer photoperiod days are associated with larger brainstem volumes and lower depressive scores, and that brainstem volume mediates the seasonality of depressive symptoms. Participants (N = 9289, 51.8% females and 48.1% males) ranging in age from 44 to 79 years were scanned by MRI at a single location. Photoperiod was found to be negatively correlated with low mood and anhedonia in females while photoperiod was found to be positively correlated with brainstem volumes. In females, whole brainstem, pons and medulla volumes individually mediated the relationship between photoperiod and both anhedonia and low mood, while midbrain volume mediated the relationship between photoperiod and anhedonia. No mediation effects were seen in males. Our study extends the understanding of the neurobiological factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of seasonal mood variations."
"The ex vivo generation of gastrointestinal organoids from crypt stem cells opens up the possibility of new research approaches investigating gastrointestinal diseases. We used this technology to study differences between healthy controls and patients with celiac disease (CD). We noticed distinct dissimilarities in the phenotypes of organoids between our study groups and found considerable variations in their gene expression. Extracellular matrix genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition are expressed most differently. In addition, we demonstrated epigenetic modifications that might be responsible for the different organoid gene expression thus accounting for a deranged crypt/villus axis development in CD. The organoids have proven valuable to demonstrate fundamental differences in duodenal derived organoids between healthy controls and patients with CD and thus are a suitable tool to gain new insights in pathogenesis of CD."
"Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in chronic liver diseases that may progress to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous studies demonstrated that adaptive immunity, in particular CD8 T cells, is critical in HBV elimination. Recent studies have revealed a distinct tissue-localized T cell lineage, tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, that is crucial for protective immunity in peripheral tissues. In this study, we showed that treatment with an anti-asialo GM1 (ASGM1) antibody (Ab), which depletes NK cells, led to impairment of HBV clearance in a mouse animal model. Unexpectedly, the ability to clear HBV was not significantly impaired in NFIL3 KO mice, which are deficient in NK cells, implying that other non-NK ASGM1-positive immune cells mediate HBV clearance. We isolated intrahepatic ASGM1-positive cells from NFIL3 KO mice and analyzed the immune phenotype of these cells. Our results demonstrated a distinct population of CD44+ LFA-1hi CD8 T cells that were the major intrahepatic ASGM1-positive immune cells in NFIL3 KO mice. Importantly, transcriptome analysis revealed that these ASGM1-positive CD8 T cells had distinct gene profiles and shared a similar core gene signature with TRM cells. In addition to both transcriptional and phenotypic liver residency characteristics, ASGM1-positive CD8 T cells were able to home to and be retained in the liver after adoptive transfer. Taken together, our study results indicate that these ASGM1-positive liver-resident CD8 T cells are the major effector immune cells mediating anti-HBV immunity."
"The antiangiogenic splice variant VEGF-A165b is downregulated in a variety of cancer entities, but little is known so far about circulating plasma levels. The present analysis addresses this question and examines circulating VEGF-A/VEGF-A165b levels in a collective of female high-risk breast cancer patients over the course of treatment. Within the SUCCES-A trial 205 patients were recruited after having received primary breast surgery. Using ELISA VEGF-A/VEGF-A165b concentrations were determined and correlated to clinical characteristics (1) before adjuvant chemotherapy, (2) four weeks and (3) two years after therapy and compared to healthy controls (n = 107). VEGF165b levels were significantly elevated after completion of chemotherapy. Within the breast cancer cohort, VEGF-A165b levels increased two years after completion of chemotherapy. VEGF-A plasma concentrations were significantly elevated in the breast cancer cohort at all examined time points and decreased after treatment. VEGF-A levels two years after chemotherapy correlated with increased cancer related mortality, no such correlation could be found between VEGF-A165b and the examined clinical characteristics. Compared to controls, VEGF-A/VEGF-A165b ratios were decreased in patients before and after chemotherapy. Our data suggests that circulating VEGF-A165b is significantly reduced in women with primary breast cancer at time of diagnosis; furthermore, levels change during adjuvant treatment."
"The growth in healthcare spending is an important topic in the United States, and preterm and low-birthweight infants have some of the highest healthcare expenditures of any patient population. We performed a retrospective cohort study of spending in this population using a large, national claims database of commercially insured individuals. A total of 763,566 infants with insurance coverage through Aetna, Inc. for the first 6 months of post-natal life were included, and received approximately $8.4 billion (2016 USD) in healthcare services. Infants with billing codes indicating preterm status (<37 weeks, n = 50,511) incurred medical expenditures of $76,153 on average, while low-birthweight status (<2500 g) was associated with average spending of $114,437. Infants born at 24 weeks gestation (n = 418) had the highest per infant average expenditures of $603,778. Understanding the drivers of variation in costs within gestational age and birthweight bands is an important target for future studies."
"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), which is correlated with changes in the gut microbiota, is a risk factor for neonatal inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Maternal hyperglycemia exerts epigenetic effects on genes that encode IEM-associated enzymes, resulting in changes in the neonatal blood metabolome. However, the relationship between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome remains poorly understood. This study aimed at understanding the connections between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome in GDM. 1H-NMR-based untargeted metabolomics was performed on maternal fecal samples and targeted metabolomics on the matched neonatal dry blood spots from a cohort of 40 pregnant women, including 22 with GDM and 18 controls. Multi-omic association methods (including Co-Inertia Analysis and Procrustes Analysis) were applied to investigate the relationship between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome. Both maternal fecal metabolome and the matched neonatal blood metabolome could be separated along the vector of maternal hyperglycemia. A close relationship between the maternal and neonatal metabolomes was observed by multi-omic association approaches. Twelve out of thirty-two maternal fecal metabolites with altered abundances from 872 1H- NMR features (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) in women with GDM and the controls were identified, among which 8 metabolites contribute (P < 0.05 in a 999-step permutation test) to the close connection between maternal and the neonatal metabolomes in GDM. Four of these eight maternal fecal metabolites, including lysine, putrescine, guanidinoacetate, and hexadecanedioate, were negatively associated (Spearman rank correlation, coefficient value < −0.6, P < 0.05) with maternal hyperglycemia. Biotin metabolism was enriched (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05 in the hypergeometric test) with the four-hyperglycemia associated fecal metabolites. The results of this study suggested that maternal fecal metabolites contribute to the connections between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome and may further affect the risk of IEMs."
"NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILC) modulate tissue homeostasis and anti-microbial immune responses. ILC development and function are regulated by cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)−7 and IL-15. However, the ILC-intrinsic pathways translating cytokine signals into developmental programs are largely unknown. Here we show that the anti-apoptotic molecule cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is crucial for the generation of IL-7/IL-15-dependent NKp46+ ILC1, including conventional natural killer (cNK) cells, and ILC3. Cytokine-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) precedes up-regulation of c-FLIP, which protects developing NKp46+ ILC from TNF-induced apoptosis. NKp46+ ILC-specific inactivation of c-FLIP leads to the loss of all IL-7/IL-15-dependent NKp46+ ILC, thereby inducing early-onset chronic colitis and subsequently microbial dysbiosis; meanwhile, the depletion of cNK, but not NKp46+ ILC1/3, aggravates experimental colitis. In summary, our data demonstrate a non-redundant function of c-FLIP for the generation of NKp46+ ILC, which protect T/B lymphocyte-sufficient mice from intestinal inflammation."
"IgE-mediated peanut allergic is common, often serious, and usually lifelong. Not all individuals who produce peanut-specific IgE will react upon consumption of peanut and can eat the food without adverse reactions, known as sensitized tolerance. Here, we employ high-dimensional mass cytometry to define the circulating immune cell signatures associated with sensitized tolerance and clinical allergy to peanut in the first year of life. Key features of clinical peanut allergic are increased frequency of activated B cells (CD19hiHLADRhi), overproduction of TNFα and increased frequency of peanut-specific memory CD4 T cells. Infants with sensitized tolerance display reduced frequency but hyper-responsive naive CD4 T cells and an increased frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This work demonstrates the utility and power of high-dimensional mass cytometry analysis to interrogate the cellular interactions that are associated with allergic sensitization and clinical food allergy in the first year of life."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor and is associated with extensive tumor cell infiltration into the adjacent brain parenchyma. However, there are limited targeted therapies that address this disease hallmark. While the invasive capacity of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their non-CSC progeny has been investigated, the mode(s) of migration used by CSCs during invasion is currently unknown. Here we used time-lapse microscopy to evaluate the migratory behavior of CSCs, with a focus on identifying key regulators of migration. A head-to-head migration assay demonstrated that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs. Time-lapse live cell imaging further revealed that GBM patient-derived CSC models either migrate in a collective manner or in a single cell fashion. To uncover conserved molecular regulators responsible for collective cell invasion, we utilized the genetically tractable Drosophila border cell collective migration model. Candidates for functional studies were generated using results from a targeted Drosophila genetic screen followed by gene expression analysis of the human homologs in GBM tumors and associated GBM patient prognosis. This strategy identified the highly conserved small GTPase, Rap1a, as a potential regulator of cell invasion. Alteration of Rap1a activity impaired the forward progress of Drosophila border cells during development. Rap1a expression was elevated in GBM and associated with higher tumor grade. Functionally, the levels of activated Rap1a impacted CSC migration speed out of spheres onto extracellular matrix. The data presented here demonstrate that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs, are capable of both collective and single cell migration, and express conserved genes that are required for migration and invasion. Using this integrated approach, we identified a new role for Rap1a in the migration of GBM CSCs."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of quantitative sensory testing (QST) and mechanical sensitivity mapping of the periauricular skin. Twenty volunteers (10 men, 10 women) participated in two sessions at intervals of one week. Cold and warm detection threshold (CDT&WDT), cold and heat pain threshold (CPT&HPT), mechanical detection and pain threshold (MDT&MPT), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and two-point discrimination (2PD) were measured at five sites: bilateral subauricular and postauricular sites (LA, RA, LB, RB) and the dorsum of left hand (control). Pressure stimulation was applied at each of the four periauricular test sites. The test-retest reliability of the QST data implied fair to excellent agreement as evaluated by the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC; all >0.4) for different days. There was no difference between each side in the QST parameters and mechanical sensitivity mapping (P ≥ 0.057). Significant differences between subauricular and postauricular sites were shown for WDT and PPT (P ≤ 0.028). NRS scores of mechanical sensitivity mapping showed significant effects of gender, site and point (P ≤ 0.040). QST and mechanical sensitivity mapping can be considered to be a reliable technique to assess somatosensory function of the periauricular skin."
"The presence of a disease continuum in inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a recognised concept, with distinct stages from at-risk stage (presence of anti citrullinated-peptide autoantibody) to diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including therapy-induced remission. Despite T-cell dysregulation being a key feature of RA, there are few reports of T-cell phenotyping along the IA-continuum. We investigated the disturbances of naïve, regulatory and inflammation related cell (IRC) CD4+ T-cell subsets in 705 individuals across the IA-continuum, developing a simple risk-score (summing presence/absence of a risk-associated with a subset) to predict progression from one stage to the next. In 158 at-risk individuals, the 3 subsets had individual association with progression to IA and the risk-score was highly predictive (p < 0.0001). In evolving IA patients, 219/294 developed RA; the risk-score included naïve and/or Treg and predicted progression (p < 0.0001). In 120 untreated RA patients, the risk-score for predicting treatment-induced remission using naïve T-cells had an odds ratio of 15.4 (p < 0.0001). In RA patients in treatment-induced remission, a score using naïve T-cells predicted disease flare (p < 0.0001). Evaluating the risk of progression using naïve CD4+ T-cells was predictive of progression along the whole IA-continuum. This should allow identification of individuals at high-risk of progression, permitting targeted therapy for improved outcomes."
"Neuromuscular impairment requires adherence to a rehabilitation regimen for maximum recovery of motor function. Consumer-grade game controllers have emerged as a viable means to relay supervised physical therapy to patients’ homes, thereby increasing their accessibility to healthcare. These controllers allow patients to perform exercise frequently and improve their rehabilitation outcomes. However, the non-universal design of game controllers targets healthy people and does not always accommodate people with disability. Consequently, many patients experience considerable difficulty assuming certain hand postures and performing the prescribed exercise correctly. Here, we explore the feasibility of improving rehabilitation outcomes through a 3D printing approach that enhances off-the-shelf game controllers in home therapy. Specifically, a custom attachment was 3D printed for a commercial haptic device that mediates fine motor rehabilitation. In an experimental study, 25 healthy subjects performed a navigation task, with the retrofit attachment and without it, while simulating disability of the upper limb. When using the attachment, subjects extended their wrist range of motion, yet maintained their level of compensation. The subjects also showed higher motivation to repeat the exercise with the enhanced device. The results bring forward evidence for the potential of this approach in transforming game controllers toward targeted interventions in home therapy."
"Denervation of skeletal muscles induces severe muscle atrophy, which is preceded by cellular alterations such as increased plasma membrane permeability, reduced resting membrane potential and accelerated protein catabolism. The factors that induce these changes remain unknown. Conversely, functional recovery following denervation depends on successful reinnervation. Here, we show that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh) from motoneurons is sufficient to prevent changes induced by denervation. Using in vitro assays, ACh and non-hydrolysable ACh analogs repressed the expression of connexin43 and connexin45 hemichannels, which promote muscle atrophy. In co-culture studies, connexin43/45 hemichannel knockout or knockdown increased innervation of muscle fibers by dorsal root ganglion neurons. Our results show that ACh released by motoneurons exerts a hitherto unknown function independent of myofiber contraction. nAChRs and connexin hemichannels are potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of pathological conditions with reduced synaptic neuromuscular transmission."
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure. Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure."
"Cancer-associated RNF43 mutations lead to activation of β-catenin signaling through aberrantly increasing Wnt-receptor levels at the membrane. Importantly, inactivating RNF43 mutations have been suggested to render cancer cells sensitive to Wnt-based therapeutics. However, the extent to which RNF43 mutations lead to impaired regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been poorly investigated. Here, we observed that tumors with a functional mismatch repair system show a predominant 5′-location of truncating RNF43 mutations, suggesting C-terminal truncations such as the most commonly reported p.G659fs mutation, do not affect β-catenin signaling. In accordance, expressing C-terminal truncation mutants and wild-type RNF43, showed equal effects on β-catenin signaling, Wnt-receptor turnover, and DVL-binding. We confirmed these observations at endogenous levels by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of G659fs RNF43 expression in KM12 cells and generating comparable mutations in HEK293T cells. We could not confirm previous reports linking RNF43 to p53 and E-cadherin breakdown. Our data also suggest that only colorectal cancer cells harboring N-terminal mutations of RNF43 convey Wnt-dependency onto the tumor cells. Results of this study have potentially important clinical implications indicating that Wnt-based therapeutics should be applied cautiously in cancer patients harboring RNF43 mutations."
"The pro-inflammatory adipokine resistin induces a phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), a process decisive for atherosclerosis, including morphological changes, increased synthetic activity, proliferation and migration. The guanine-exchange factor ARNO (Cytohesin-2) has been shown to be important for morphological changes and migration of other cell types. In this study we dissected the role of ARNO in resistin induced VSMC phenotypic switching and signalling. Firstly, treatment with the cytohesin inhibitor Secin H3 prevented the resistin mediated induction of morphological changes in VSMC. Secondly, Secin H3 treatment as well as expression of an inactive ARNO (EK) reduced resistin induced VSMC synthetic activity, as assessed by matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression, as well as the migration into a wound in vitro compared to ARNO WT expression. Thirdly, we found ARNO to influence MMP-2 expression and migration via activation of p38 MAPK and the JNK/AP-1 pathway. Interestingly, these processes were shown to be dependent on the binding of PIP3, as mutation of the ARNO PH-domain inhibited VSMC migration, MMP-2 expression as well as p38 MAPK and JNK signalling. Thus, we demonstrate that ARNO is an important link in resistin dependent cell signalling leading to morphological changes, MMP-2 production and migration of VSMC."
"Understanding the principles of neuronal connectivity requires tools for efficient quantification and visualization of large datasets. The primate cortex is particularly challenging due to its complex mosaic of areas, which in many cases lack clear boundaries. Here, we introduce a resource that allows exploration of results of 143 retrograde tracer injections in the marmoset neocortex. Data obtained in different animals are registered to a common stereotaxic space using an algorithm guided by expert delineation of histological borders, allowing accurate assignment of connections to areas despite interindividual variability. The resource incorporates tools for analyses relative to cytoarchitectural areas, including statistical properties such as the fraction of labeled neurons and the percentage of supragranular neurons. It also provides purely spatial (parcellation-free) data, based on the stereotaxic coordinates of 2 million labeled neurons. This resource helps bridge the gap between high-density cellular connectivity studies in rodents and imaging-based analyses of human brains."
"Study designQualitative exploratory study.ObjectivesPressure injuries (PIs) are a major secondary condition occurring after spinal cord injuries (SCI). Optimization of outpatient and community care may be a promising approach to better support community-dwelling individuals with SCI in preventing PIs. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences of individuals with SCI, family caregivers and health professionals (HPs) in using or providing outpatient and community services for early treatment and prevention of PIs in SCI.SettingSwitzerland.MethodsSemi-structured interviews with a sample of Swiss residents community-dwelling individuals with SCI (n = 20), family caregivers (n = 5) and HPs (n = 22) were analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsGeneral practitioners (GPs), home care providers, SCI-specialized outpatient clinics and an SCI-specialized nursing service are involved in the prevention and early treatment of PIs. Our findings show that the needs of individuals with SCI are not fully met: outpatient and community care is often fragmented, mono-professional and non-specialized, while persons with SCI and HPs prefer coordinated, inter-professional and specialized services for preventing and treating PIs. Our findings also highlight the challenges faced by HPs in providing care to individuals with SCI in the community.ConclusionsAlthough there seems to be a gap in service provision, there is the potential for improvement by better integrating the different providers in a network and structuring their collaborations. Concrete suggestions are: systematizing knowledge transfer to home care providers and GPs; redefining the role of involved HPs and individuals with SCI and reinforcing the role of the SCI-specialized nursing service."
"Hyperprogressive disease (HPD), an unexpected acceleration of tumor growth kinetics, is described in cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents. Here, our aim was to take into consideration the host and explore whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key genes involved in immune response might predispose to HPD. DNA was extracted from blood-samples from 98 patients treated under CPI monotherapy. Four candidate genes (PD-1, PD-L1, IDO1 and VEGFR2) and 15 potential SNPs were selected. The TGKR (ratio of the slope of tumor growth before treatment and the slope of tumor growth on treatment) was calculated. Hyperprogression was defined as a TGKR≥2. TGKR calculation was feasible for 80 patients (82%). HPD was observed for 11 patients (14%) and was associated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.003). In univariate analysis, HPD was significantly associated with age ≥70 y (P = 0.025), immune-related toxicity (P = 0.016), VEGFR2 rs1870377 A/T or A/A (P = 0.005), PD-L1 rs2282055 G/T or G/G (P = 0.024) and PD-L1 rs2227981 G/A or A/A (P = 0.024). Multivariate analysis confirmed the correlation between HPD and age ≥70 y (P = 0.006), VEGFR2 rs1870377 A/T or A/A (P = 0.007) and PD-L1 rs2282055 G/T or G/G (P = 0.018). Immunogenetics could become integral predictive factors for CPI-based immunotherapy."
"Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, Nr5a2) is an orphan nuclear receptor mainly expressed in tissues of endodermal origin, where its physiological role has been extensively studied. LRH-1 has been implicated in liver cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism. In addition, increasing evidence highlights its role in immunoregulatory processes via glucocorticoid synthesis in the intestinal epithelium. Although the direct function of LRH-1 in immune cells is fairly elucidated, a role of LRH-1 in the regulation of macrophage differentiation has been recently reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Our data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition, along with LRH-1 knockdown, significantly reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the macrophage line RAW 264.7 cells, as well as in primary murine macrophages. This inhibitory effect was found to be independent of defects of LRH-1-regulated cell proliferation or toxic effects of the LRH-1 inhibitors. In contrast, LRH-1 inhibition reduced the mitochondrial ATP production and metabolism of macrophages through downregulation of the LRH-1 targets glucokinase and glutminase-2, and thus impairing the LPS-induced macrophage activation. Interestingly, in vivo pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 also resulted in reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production and associated decreased liver damage in a macrophage- and TNF-dependent mouse model of hepatitis. Noteworthy, despite hepatocytes expressing high levels of LRH-1, pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 per se did not cause any obvious liver damage. Therefore, this study proposes LRH-1 as an emerging therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, especially where macrophages and cytokines critically decide the extent of inflammation."
"Handling of submicron-sized objects is important in many biochemical and biomedical applications, but few methods today can precisely manipulate this range of particles. We present gradient acoustic focusing that enables flow-through particle separation of submicron particles and cells and we apply it for separation of bacteria from blood lysate to facilitate their detection in whole blood for improved diagnostics. To control suspended objects below the classical 2µm size limit for acoustic focusing, we introduce a co-flowing acoustic impedance gradient to generate a stabilizing acoustic volume force that supresses acoustic streaming. The method is validated theoretically and experimentally using polystyrene particles, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by the separation of bacteria from selectively chemically lysed blood. Combined with downstream operations, this new approach opens up for novel methods for sepsis diagnostics."
"The explosion of network science has permitted an understanding of how the structure of social networks affects the dynamics of social contagion. In community-based interventions with spill-over effects, identifying influential spreaders may be harnessed to increase the spreading efficiency of social contagion, in terms of time needed to spread all the largest connected component of the network. Several strategies have been proved to be efficient using only data and simulation-based models in specific network topologies without a consensus of an overall result. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to benchmark the spreading efficiency of seeding strategies related to network structural properties and sizes. We simulate spreading processes on empirical and simulated social networks within a wide range of densities, clustering coefficients, and sizes. We also propose three new decentralized seeding strategies that are structurally different from well-known strategies: community hubs, ambassadors, and random hubs. We observe that the efficiency ranking of strategies varies with the network structure. In general, for sparse networks with community structure, decentralized influencers are suitable for increasing the spreading efficiency. By contrast, when the networks are denser, centralized influencers outperform. These results provide a framework for selecting efficient strategies according to different contexts in which social networks emerge."
"To ensure reproducibility in research quantifying episodic migraine attacks, and identifying attack onset, a sound theoretical model of a migraine attack, paired with a uniform standard for counting them, is necessary. Many studies report on migraine frequencies—e.g. the fraction of migraine-days of the observed days—without paying attention to the number of discrete attacks. Furthermore, patients’ diaries frequently contain single, migraine-free days between migraine-days, and we argue here that such ‘migraine-locked days’ should routinely be interpreted as part of a single attack. We tested a simple Markov model of migraine attacks on headache diary data and estimated transition probabilities by mapping each day of each diary to a unique Markov state. We explored the validity of imputing migraine days on migraine-locked entries, and estimated the effect of imputation on observed migraine frequencies. Diaries from our patients demonstrated significant clustering of migraine days. The proposed Markov chain model was shown to approximate the progression of observed migraine attacks satisfactorily, and imputing on migraine-locked days was consistent with the conceptual model for the progression of migraine attacks. Hence, we provide an easy method for quantifying the number and duration of migraine attacks, enabling researchers to procure data of high inter-study validity."
"Tumor invasion underlies further metastasis, the leading cause for cancer-related deaths. Deregulation of microRNAs has been identified associated with the malignant behavior of various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the major subtype of lung cancer. Here, we showed the significantly positive correlation between miR-629-5p level and tumor invasion in LUAD specimens (n = 49). In a human LUAD metastasis mouse model, H1650 cells (high level of miR-629-5p) were more aggressive than A549 cells (low level of miR-629-5p) in vivo, including higher incidence of vascular invasion and pulmonary colonization. Ectopic expression of miR-629-5p in A549 cells also increased their invasive capability. Then we identified that miR-629-5p promotes LUAD invasion in a mode of dual regulation via tumor cells invasion and endothelial cells permeability, respectively. In tumor cells, miR-629-5p enhanced motility and invasiveness of tumor cells by directly targeting PPWD1 (a cyclophilin), which clinically related to tumor invasion in LUAD specimens. Restoring PPWD1 protein significantly attenuated the invasion-promoting effects of miR-629-5p. Besides, exosomal-miR-629-5p secreted from tumor cells could be transferred to endothelial cells and increased endothelial monolayers permeability by suppressing CELSR1 (a nonclassic-type cadherin), which had a low level in the endothelial cells of invasive LUAD specimens. Activating the expression of CELSR1 in endothelial cells markedly blocked the effect of miR-629-5p. Our study suggests the dual roles of miR-629-5p in tumor cells and endothelial cells for LUAD invasion, implying a therapeutic option to targeting miR-629-5p using the “one stone, two birds” strategy in LUAD."
"Activated caspase-1 and caspase-11 induce inflammatory cell death in a process termed pyroptosis. Here we show that Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibits caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in murine and human macrophages. PGE2 suppreses caspase-11 expression in murine and human macrophages and in the airways of mice with allergic inflammation. Remarkably, caspase-11-deficient mice are strongly resistant to developing experimental allergic airway inflammation, where PGE2 is known to be protective. Expression of caspase-11 is elevated in the lung of wild type mice with allergic airway inflammation. Blocking PGE2 production with indomethacin enhances, whereas the prostaglandin E1 analog misoprostol inhibits lung caspase-11 expression. Finally, alveolar macrophages from asthma patients exhibit increased expression of caspase-4, a human homologue of caspase-11. Our findings identify PGE2 as a negative regulator of caspase-11-driven pyroptosis and implicate caspase-4/11 as a critical contributor to allergic airway inflammation, with implications for pathophysiology of asthma."
"ObjectiveTo explore the relationship between neonatal oxygen saturation and BP at age 6–7 years in a cohort of infants born extremely preterm.Study designInfants <28 weeks gestation were assigned to a higher or lower oxygen saturation target. Oximeter data were monitored throughout the neonatal period. A subset of survivors was seen at age 6. BP was measured and compared by group assignment, achieved saturations, and time spent in hypoxemia (saturations <80%).ResultsThere was no difference in systolic or diastolic BP between assigned groups. Median achieved weekly oxygen saturation was not associated with BP. Longer duration of hypoxemia during the first week of age was associated with higher systolic BP.ConclusionsNeither target nor actual median oxygen saturations in this study was associated with BP at school age. Increased duration of hypoxemia in the first postnatal week was associated with higher systolic BP at 6–7 years of age."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex genetic disease that is instigated and amplified by the confluence of multiple genetic and environmental variables that perturb the immune–microbiome axis. The challenge of dissecting pathological mechanisms underlying IBD has led to the development of transformative approaches in human genetics and functional genomics. Here we describe IBD as a model disease in the context of leveraging human genetics to dissect interactions in cellular and molecular pathways that regulate homeostasis of the mucosal immune system. Finally, we synthesize emerging insights from multiple experimental approaches into pathway paradigms and discuss future prospects for disease-subtype classification and therapeutic intervention."
"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in 25–70% of patients. The gold standard (GS) test to confirm the diagnosis of GVHD has some limitations. The current study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of three serum markers in diagnosing GVHD without a GS. 94 patients who were hospitalized for allogeneic transplantation were studied. Mean levels from day of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to discharge of serum uric acid (UA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine (Cr) were measured for all participants. We adapted a Bayesian latent class analysis to modelling the results of each marker and combination of markers. The Sensitivity, Specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for LDH were as 51%, 81%, and 0.70, respectively. For UA, the Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC were 54%, 75%, and 0.71, respectively. The estimated Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC of Cr were 72%, 94%, and 0.86, respectively. Adjusting for covariates, the combined Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC of the optimal marker combination were 76%, 83%, and 0.94, respectively. To conclude, our findings suggested that Cr had the strongest diagnosis power for GVHD. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the three-marker combination outperforms the other combinations."
"Lung infections play a critical role in cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogenesis. CF respiratory tract is now considered to be a polymicrobial niche and advances in high-throughput sequencing allowed to analyze its microbiota and mycobiota. However, no NGS studies until now have characterized both communities during CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE). Thirty-three sputa isolated from patients with and without CFPE were used for metagenomic high-throughput sequencing targeting 16S and ITS2 regions of bacterial and fungal rRNA. We built inter-kingdom network and adapted Phy-Lasso method to highlight correlations in compositional data. The decline in respiratory function was associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity. The inter-kingdom network revealed three main clusters organized around Aspergillus, Candida, and Scedosporium genera. Using Phy-Lasso method, we identified Aspergillus and Malassezia as relevantly associated with CFPE, and Scedosporium plus Pseudomonas with a decline in lung function. We corroborated in vitro the cross-domain interactions between Aspergillus and Streptococcus predicted by the correlation network. For the first time, we included documented mycobiome data into a version of the ecological Climax/Attack model that opens new lines of thoughts about the physiopathology of CF lung disease and future perspectives to improve its therapeutic management."
"Preimplantation genetic testing-human leukocyte antigen ‘(PGT-HLA) only’ refers to the HLA typing of single or few cells biopsied from in vitro fertilized preimplantation embryos. The aim of the procedure is to establish a pregnancy, in which the fetus is HLA compatible with an affected sibling in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). During PGT-M-HLA, the identification of a HLA-compatible embryo is combined with the detection of mutation(s) underlying immunodeficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. We report a combined retrospective and prospective cohort analysis of PGT-(M-)HLA procedures carried out from 1998 until 2017, with follow-up of transplantations to 2019. During the study period, 234 couples from 22 countries were invited for a multidisciplinary consultation. Two couples were rejected and 70 couples declined (various reasons), leaving 162 couples for which 414 clinical cycles were carried out. Cleavage stage biopsy followed by single-cell multiplex PCR for short tandem repeat-based haplotyping was applied in most cases (98.7%). The diagnostic efficiency was high (94.8%) but only 16.5% of the embryos was genetically suitable for transfer. Fresh and frozen-thawed embryo transfer resulted in 67 clinical pregnancies, 63 deliveries, and 74 live births, of which 60 children were HLA compatible. This yielded a live birth delivery rate of 30.3% per transfer. Information on neonatal characteristics of the matching PGT-(M-)HLA children showed reassuring outcomes. So far, HSCT was carried out successfully for 25 out of 26 cases. In conclusion, our data show that PGT-(M-)HLA is a valuable procedure: the high complexity and limited delivery rate are balanced by the successful HSCT outcome and the positive impact on families."
"Tumors harbor extensive genetic heterogeneity in the form of distinct clone genotypes that arise over time and across different tissues and regions in cancer. Many computational methods produce clone phylogenies from population bulk sequencing data collected from multiple tumor samples from a patient. These clone phylogenies are used to infer mutation order and clone origins during tumor progression, rendering the selection of the appropriate clonal deconvolution method critical. Surprisingly, absolute and relative accuracies of these methods in correctly inferring clone phylogenies are yet to consistently assessed. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of seven computational methods. The accuracy of the reconstructed mutation order and inferred clone groupings varied extensively among methods. All the tested methods showed limited ability to identify ancestral clone sequences present in tumor samples correctly. The presence of copy number alterations, the occurrence of multiple seeding events among tumor sites during metastatic tumor evolution, and extensive intermixture of cancer cells among tumors hindered the detection of clones and the inference of clone phylogenies for all methods tested. Overall, CloneFinder, MACHINA, and LICHeE showed the highest overall accuracy, but none of the methods performed well for all simulated datasets. So, we present guidelines for selecting methods for data analysis."
"This study’s objective was the generation of a standardized geometry of the healthy nasal cavity. An average geometry of the healthy nasal cavity was generated using a statistical shape model based on 25 symptom-free subjects. Airflow within the average geometry and these geometries was calculated using fluid simulations. Integral measures of the nasal resistance, wall shear stresses (WSS) and velocities were calculated as well as cross-sectional areas (CSA). Furthermore, individual WSS and static pressure distributions were mapped onto the average geometry. The average geometry featured an overall more regular shape that resulted in less resistance, reduced WSS and velocities compared to the median of the 25 geometries. Spatial distributions of WSS and pressure of the average geometry agreed well compared to the average distributions of all individual geometries. The minimal CSA of the average geometry was larger than the median of all individual geometries (83.4 vs. 74.7 mm²). The airflow observed within the average geometry of the healthy nasal cavity did not equal the average airflow of the individual geometries. While differences observed for integral measures were notable, the calculated values for the average geometry lay within the distributions of the individual parameters. Spatially resolved parameters differed less prominently."
"We conducted two online surveys about antibiotics targeted at the Japanese general population in March 2017 and February 2018. In total, 6,982 participants completed the questionnaire. Factors associated with knowledge of antibiotics, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and appropriate behavioural changes were evaluated by a machine learning approach using DataRobot. Factors strongly associated with three dependent variables in the model were extracted based on permuation importance. We found that the strongest determinant of knowledge of antibiotics and AMR was education level. Knowledge of antibiotics was strongly associated with the frequency of internet use. Exposure to primary information was associated with motivation for appropriate behavioural changes. Improving the availability of primary information would be a beneficial intervention. Individuals lacking higher education and without opportunities to obtain primary information should be considered a target population for effective interventions."
"Although APE2 plays essential roles in base excision repair and ATR-Chk1 DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, it remains unknown how the APE2 gene is altered in the human genome and whether APE2 is differentially expressed in cancer patients. Here, we report multiple-cancer analyses of APE2 genomic alterations and mRNA expression from cancer patients using available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We observe that APE2 genomic alterations occur at ~17% frequency in 14 cancer types (n = 21,769). Most frequent somatic mutations of APE2 appear in uterus (2.89%) and skin (2.47%) tumor samples. Furthermore, APE2 expression is upregulated in tumor tissue compared with matched non-malignant tissue across 5 cancer types including kidney, breast, lung, liver, and uterine cancers, but not in prostate cancer. We also examine the mRNA expression of 13 other DNA repair and DDR genes from matched samples for 6 cancer types. We show that APE2 mRNA expression is positively correlated with PCNA, APE1, XRCC1, PARP1, Chk1, and Chk2 across these 6 tumor tissue types; however, groupings of other DNA repair and DDR genes are correlated with APE2 with different patterns in different cancer types. Taken together, this study demonstrates alterations and abnormal expression of APE2 from multiple cancers."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms continue to rival human performance on a variety of clinical tasks, while their actual impact on human diagnosticians, when incorporated into clinical workflows, remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based assistant to help pathologists differentiate between two subtypes of primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, on hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images (WSI), and evaluated its effect on the diagnostic performance of 11 pathologists with varying levels of expertise. Our model achieved accuracies of 0.885 on a validation set of 26 WSI, and 0.842 on an independent test set of 80 WSI. Although use of the assistant did not change the mean accuracy of the 11 pathologists (p = 0.184, OR = 1.281), it significantly improved the accuracy (p = 0.045, OR = 1.499) of a subset of nine pathologists who fell within well-defined experience levels (GI subspecialists, non-GI subspecialists, and trainees). In the assisted state, model accuracy significantly impacted the diagnostic decisions of all 11 pathologists. As expected, when the model’s prediction was correct, assistance significantly improved accuracy (p = 0.000, OR = 4.289), whereas when the model’s prediction was incorrect, assistance significantly decreased accuracy (p = 0.000, OR = 0.253), with both effects holding across all pathologist experience levels and case difficulty levels. Our results highlight the challenges of translating AI models into the clinical setting, and emphasize the importance of taking into account potential unintended negative consequences of model assistance when designing and testing medical AI-assistance tools."
"The adenosine A2B receptor is a critical protein in intestinal water secretion. In the present study, we screened compound libraries to identify inhibitors of the A2B receptor and evaluated their effect on adenosine-induced intestinal fluid secretion. The screening identified the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists nifedipine and nisoldipine. Their respective affinities for the A2B receptor (Ki value) were 886 and 1,399 nM. Nifedipine and nisoldipine, but not amlodipine or nitrendipine, inhibited both calcium mobilization and adenosine-induced cAMP accumulation in cell lines. Moreover, adenosine injection into the lumen significantly increased fluid volume in the colonic loop of wild-type mice but not A2B receptor-deficient mice. PSB-1115, a selective A2B receptor antagonist, and nifedipine prevented elevated adenosine-stimulated fluid secretion in mice. Our results may provide useful insights into the structure–activity relationship of dihydropyridines for A2B receptor. As colonic fluid secretion by adenosine seems to rely predominantly on the A2B receptor, nifedipine could be a therapeutic candidate for diarrhoea-related diseases."
"Cannabidiol (CBD) has become a buzzword in many products that have bloomed on the market. The scientific community and some authorities have recently raised concerns on the quality of these products. In particular, the discrepancy between the labelled and the real content of cannabidiol in liquids for e-cigarettes seems to be emerging as a major issue. Furthermore, to-date no studies have been carried out on the chemical stability upon storage of these type of products. The aim of this work was to investigate the accuracy in labelling of thirteen commercially e-liquids containing CBD and the effects of different storage conditions on their quality. The results showed that only 38% of samples were labelled within a ±10% variance from their labels. Stability tests showed a maximum degradation of CBD when samples were stored at 37 °C for 30 days with average values up to 20%. The effect of light was lower but still significant with averages values up to 15% degradation after 30 days. In conclusion, we believe that health authorities should regulate and control this market more stringently to protect customers and their health. Furthermore, our stability tests have shown that if clear indications are provided on the best storage conditions, the quality of these products can be mostly preserved."
"We compared outcomes of four different management modalities for diabetic VH. Patients with diabetic VH were identified in this retrospective study undertaken at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Eyes were grouped based on the treatment received: control (observation only), intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection(s), pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), and preoperative single IVB injection before PPV. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and status of VH were noted at baseline and the last follow up (Minimum: 6 months, maximum: 29 months). The proportion of eyes with Snellen BCVA improvement by two lines or more and VH clearance at the last follow up were compared between groups. The four groups – Control, IVB, PPV, and IVB-before-PPV had 23, 29, 17, and 20 eyes, respectively. The proportion of eyes gaining ≥2 lines was substantially higher in the IVB-before-PPV and PPV groups (90% and 77%, respectively) compared with IVB and observation groups (41% and 22%, respectively). Surgical treatment was associated with a 2.38 times higher likelihood of gaining ≥2 lines than the non-surgical one (incidence ratio: 2.38, 95% CI 1.19, 4.78 P = 0.015) after adjusting for age, hyperglycemia and BCVA at presentation. Less invasive treatment such as IVB injections did not result in the same amount of improvement in vision as did PPV. Prospective randomized studies are needed to better define the role of IVB injections in the management of diabetic VH."
"Crocetin (CRT) has shown various neuroprotective effects such as antioxidant activities and the inhibition of amyloid β fibril formation, and thus is a potential therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, poor water solubility and bioavailability are the major obstacles in formulation development and pharmaceutical applications of CRT. In this study, a novel water-soluble CRT-γ-cyclodextrin inclusion complex suitable for intravenous injection was developed. The inclusion complex was nontoxic to normal neuroblastoma cells (N2a cells and SH-SY5Y cells) and AD model cells (7PA2 cells). Furthermore, it showed stronger ability to downregulate the expression of C-terminus fragments and level of amyloid β in 7PA2 cell line as compared to the CRT free drug. Both inclusion complex and CRT were able to prevent SH-SY5Y cell death from H2O2-induced toxicity. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies showed that CRT-γ-cyclodextrin inclusion complex significantly increased the bioavailability of CRT and facilitated CRT crossing the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain. This data shows a water-soluble γ-cyclodextrin inclusion complex helped to deliver CRT across the blood-brain barrier. This success should fuel further pharmaceutical research on CRT in the treatment for AD, and it should engender research on γ-cyclodextrin with other drugs that have so far not been explored."
"Structural network-based approaches can assess white matter connections revealing topological alterations in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, principal network (PN) organisation and its clinical relevance in MS has not been explored yet. Here, structural networks were reconstructed from diffusion data in 58 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 28 primary progressive MS (PPMS), 36 secondary progressive (SPMS) and 51 healthy controls (HCs). Network hubs’ strengths were compared with HCs. Then, PN analysis was performed in each clinical subtype. Regression analysis was applied to investigate the associations between nodal strength derived from the first and second PNs (PN1 and PN2) in MS, with clinical disability. Compared with HCs, MS patients had preserved hub number, but some hubs exhibited reduced strength. PN1 comprised 10 hubs in HCs, RRMS and PPMS but did not include the right thalamus in SPMS. PN2 comprised 10 hub regions with intra-hemispheric connections in HCs. In MS, this subnetwork did not include the right putamen whilst in SPMS the right thalamus was also not included. Decreased nodal strength of the right thalamus and putamen from the PNs correlated strongly with higher clinical disability. These PN analyses suggest distinct patterns of disruptions in MS subtypes which are clinically relevant"
"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a deacetylase that modulates proteins that control metabolism and protects against oxidative stress. Modulation of SIRT3 activity has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target for ameliorating metabolic diseases and associated cardiac disturbances. In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in inflammation and fibrosis in the heart using male mice with constitutive and systemic deletion of SIRT3 and human cardiac AC16 cells. SIRT3 knockout mice showed cardiac fibrosis and inflammation that was characterized by augmented transcriptional activity of AP-1. Consistent with this, SIRT3 overexpression in human and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes partially prevented the inflammatory and profibrotic response induced by TNF-α. Notably, these effects were associated with a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of FOS and the DNA-binding activity of AP-1. Finally, we demonstrated that SIRT3 inhibits FOS transcription through specific histone H3 lysine K27 deacetylation at its promoter. These findings highlight an important function of SIRT3 in mediating the often intricate profibrotic and proinflammatory responses of cardiac cells through the modulation of the FOS/AP-1 pathway. Since fibrosis and inflammation are crucial in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and diabetic cardiomyopathy, our results point to SIRT3 as a potential target for treating these diseases."
"The underlying mechanism regulating hypoxia induced alteration in female steroid hormones is first time explored in this study. To understand the mechanistic approach, female Sprague- Dawley rats were exposed to acute and chronic hypobaric hypoxia (282 mm-Hg, ~7620 m, 6 hours, 3 and 7 days). Estrous cycle, body weight, plasma progesterone and estradiol levels, morphology, histology and two key steroidogenic enzymes: 3ß hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17ß HSD activity of ovary and adrenal gland were studied. A persistent diestrous phase and a significant decrease in body weight were found in chronic hypoxia groups. Histological study suggested degenerative changes in ovarian corpus luteum of 7 days chronic hypobaric hypoxia (7CHH) group and a declined percentage of adrenocortical cells in 3 days chronic hypobaric hypoxia (3CHH) and 7CHH groups. Plasma estradiol level was unaltered, but progesterone level was decreased significantly in all hypoxic groups. Ovarian 3ß HSD activity was decreased significantly with increasing days of hypoxic treatment along with a significantly low adrenal 3ß HSD activity in 7CHH. In conclusion, hypobaric hypoxia causes a state of low circulatory progesterone level in females likely due to the degenerative changes in the female ovarian and adrenal tissues together with low steroidogenic 3ß HSD enzyme activity."
"Right colonic diverticulitis (RCD) and left colonic diverticulitis (LCD) may have different clinical features due to the different embryologic origins and anatomical locations of each colon. Therefore, we aimed to compare RCD and LCD in terms of the associated clinical features. We retrospectively collected clinical data from patients who were diagnosed with acute colonic diverticulitis based on computed tomography findings between 2011 and 2017. RCD was defined as colonic diverticulitis extending from the caecum to the transverse colon, and LCD was defined as extending from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. These analyses included 667 patients with RCD and 58 patients with LCD. Relative to the patients with LCD, the patients with RCD were younger (P < 0.001), were more likely to be male (P = 0.033), were taller (P < 0.001), had lower body mass index values (P < 0.001), had less advanced modified Hinchey stages (P < 0.001), and had shorter hospital stays (P < 0.001). Having LCD rather than RCD was a predictor of recurrent colonic diverticulitis (P = 0.003). Relative to LCD, RCD occurs at younger ages, is expressed at less advanced modified Hinchey stages, and is associated with lower risks of recurrence."
"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. We previously proposed that the intracellular bacteria detected in OLP lesions are important triggering factors for T cell infiltration. This study aimed to identify OLP-associated bacterial species through the characterization of intratissue bacterial communities of OLP lesions. Seven pairs of bacterial communities collected from the mucosal surface and biopsied tissues of OLP lesions were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The intratissue bacterial communities were characterized by decreased alpha diversity but increased beta diversity compared with those on the mucosal surface. While the relative abundance of most taxa was decreased within the tissues, that of Escherichia coli was significantly increased. Four E. coli strains were isolated from additional OLP biopsies and verified as K12 strains by whole-genome sequencing. The distribution of E. coli in sections of control (n = 12) and OLP (n = 22) tissues was examined by in situ hybridization. E. coli was detected in most OLP tissues, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of OLP. The oral E. coli strains isolated from OLP tissues will be useful to investigate their role as triggering factors for T cell infiltration."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) increases early mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients and may accelerate chronic kidney disease (CKD) development. We analyzed prospective variables related to AKI and CKD in 422 allo-HCT recipients to establish risk factors of severe acute renal failure and CKD. Renal function and creatinine were periodically assessed from baseline till the last follow-up. Sixty-three patients (14%) developed severe AKI (AKI-3) at 100 days post transplant and 15% at 12 months. Variables associated with AKI-3 were age above 55 years [hazard ratio (HR): 2.4; p = 0.019], total body irradiation (TBI) (HR: 1.8; p = 0.044), high-risk cytomegalovirus reactivation (HR: 1.8; p = 0.041), and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis (HR: 2.1; p = 0.024). AKI-3 increased the mortality risk (HR: 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.9–3.4). The CKD prevalence in 161 living patients was 10.2% at the last follow-up and in most, CKD developed 1 year post HCT, independent of AKI. The CKD at 1 year post HCT was associated with increased mortality (HR: 3.54; p < 0.001). Interestingly, pretransplant CKD was associated with early mortality (HR: 5.6; p < 0.001). In fact, pre- and posttransplant CKD had independent unfavorable long-term outcomes. These pretransplant factors can potentially be targeted to improve allo-HCT outcomes."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and incurable form of interstitial lung disease in which persistent injury results in scar tissue formation. As fibrosis thickens, the lung tissue loses the ability to facilitate gas exchange and provide cells with needed oxygen. Currently, IPF has few treatment options and no effective therapies, aside from lung transplant. Here we present a series of studies utilizing lung spheroid cell-secretome (LSC-Sec) and exosomes (LSC-Exo) by inhalation to treat different models of lung injury and fibrosis. Analysis reveals that LSC-Sec and LSC-Exo treatments could attenuate and resolve bleomycin- and silica-induced fibrosis by reestablishing normal alveolar structure and decreasing both collagen accumulation and myofibroblast proliferation. Additionally, LSC-Sec and LSC-Exo exhibit superior therapeutic benefits than their counterparts derived from mesenchymal stem cells in some measures. We showed that an inhalation treatment of secretome and exosome exhibited therapeutic potential for lung regeneration in two experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis."
"Understanding how animals respond to injury and how wounds heal remains a challenge. These questions can be addressed using genetically tractable animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Given its small size, the current methods for inflicting wounds in a controlled manner are demanding. To facilitate and accelerate the procedure, we fabricated regular arrays of pyramidal features (""pins”) sharp enough to pierce the tough nematode cuticle. The pyramids were made from monocrystalline silicon wafers that were micro-structured using optical lithography and alkaline wet etching. The fabrication protocol and the geometry of the pins, determined by electron microscopy, are described in detail. We also used electron microscopy to characterize the different types of injury caused by these pins. Upon wounding, C. elegans expresses genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. A comparison of the induction of antimicrobial peptide gene expression using traditional needles and the pin arrays demonstrates the utility of this new method."
"Following detection of high levels of serum prostate-specific antigen, many men are advised to have transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in an attempt to locate a cancer. This nontargeted approach lacks accuracy and carries a small risk of potentially life-threatening sepsis. Worse still, it can detect clinically insignificant cancer cells, which are unlikely to be the origin of advanced-stage disease. The detection of these indolent cancer cells has led to overdiagnosis, one of the major problems of contemporary medicine, whereby many men with clinically insignificant disease are advised to undergo unnecessary radical surgery or radiotherapy. Advances in imaging and biomarker discovery have led to a revolution in prostate cancer diagnosis, and nontargeted prostate biopsies should become obsolete. In this Perspective article, we describe the current diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer, which relies on nontargeted biopsies, and the problems linked to this pathway. We then discuss the utility of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI and novel tumour markers. Finally, we comment on how the incorporation of these advances into a new diagnostic pathway will affect the current risk-stratification system and explore future challenges."
"Various species of the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer1,2, but it has not been demonstrated that bacteria have a direct role in the occurrence of oncogenic mutations. Escherichia coli can carry the pathogenicity island pks, which encodes a set of enzymes that synthesize colibactin3. This compound is believed to alkylate DNA on adenine residues4,5 and induces double-strand breaks in cultured cells3. Here we expose human intestinal organoids to genotoxic pks+ E. coli by repeated luminal injection over five months. Whole-genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure revealed a distinct mutational signature that was absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria. The same mutational signature was detected in a subset of 5,876 human cancer genomes from two independent cohorts, predominantly in colorectal cancer. Our study describes a distinct mutational signature in colorectal cancer and implies that the underlying mutational process results directly from past exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing pks pathogenicity island."
"Diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) have been reclassified based on molecular mutations, which require invasive tumor tissue sampling. Tissue sampling by biopsy may be limited by sampling error, whereas non-invasive imaging can evaluate the entirety of a tumor. This study presents a non-invasive analysis of low-grade gliomas using imaging features based on the updated classification. We introduce molecular (MGMT methylation, IDH mutation, 1p/19q co-deletion, ATRX mutation, and TERT mutations) prediction methods of low-grade gliomas with imaging. Imaging features are extracted from magnetic resonance imaging data and include texture features, fractal and multi-resolution fractal texture features, and volumetric features. Training models include nested leave-one-out cross-validation to select features, train the model, and estimate model performance. The prediction models of MGMT methylation, IDH mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion, ATRX mutation, and TERT mutations achieve a test performance AUC of 0.83 ± 0.04, 0.84 ± 0.03, 0.80 ± 0.04, 0.70 ± 0.09, and 0.82 ± 0.04, respectively. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the fractal features have a significant effect on the predictive performance of MGMT methylation IDH mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion, and ATRX mutations. The performance of our prediction methods indicates the potential of correlating computed imaging features with LGG molecular mutations types and identifies candidates that may be considered potential predictive biomarkers of LGG molecular classification."
"Childbearing women with rheumatoid (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have significant peripartum issues. A retrospective anonymous RedCAP survey of peripartum period in females with RA/PsA in the RAPPORT registry was performed. Completed analyses included descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. 162 patients (133 RA/29 PsA) completed the survey (103 women having 234 pregnancies), 164 pregnancies occurring before and 70 pregnancies occurring after diagnosis. Pregnancy outcomes from 103 patients included: 96% live births, 1.9% stillbirths, 23% miscarriages, and 15% therapeutic abortions. A third of patients had fewer children than desired due to disease activity, medications and other reasons. For 63 pregnancies after diagnosis: (1) 49% of pregnancies received pre-conception counseling; (2) 65% described good disease control during pregnancy but 74% flared in the first 3 months postpartum; (3) 79% of pregnancies discontinued IA medications; (4) 35% of pregnancies occurred on biologic therapy at or prior to conception. Gestational age at time of delivery was 37–40 weeks in 58% (33/57) post-arthritis vs 66% (83/126) pre-arthritis pregnancies. No statistically significant differences occurred between pregnancies before or after RA/PsA diagnosis for: pregnancy planning, fertility treatment, pregnancy and labour/delivery complications, birth defect frequency or neonatal complications. Neonatal ICU admissions were significantly lower in pre- compared to post-arthritis pregnancies (3.2% vs 14.5%). No pregnancy complications were noted in 24/54 pregnancies on medications compared to 6/9 pregnancies not on medications. The impact of RA/PsA before, during and after pregnancy varied considerably in this cohort emphasizing the importance of informed-decision making at all stages."
"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) develops due to the narrowing or blockage of arteries supplying blood to the lower limbs. Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE−/−) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies."
"The B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is currently being evaluated as promising tumor-associated surface antigen for T-cell-based immunotherapy approaches, such as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies, in multiple myeloma (MM). Cytotoxic T cells bearing BCMA-specific T-cell receptors might further allow targeting HLA-presented antigens derived from the intracellular domain of BCMA. By analyzing a mass spectrometry-acquired immunopeptidome dataset of primary MM samples and MM cell lines for BCMA-derived HLA ligands, we identified the naturally presented HLA-B*18-restricted ligand P(BCMA)B*18. Additionally, P(BCMA)B*18 was identified on primary CLL samples, thereby expanding the range for possible applications. P(BCMA)B*18 induced multifunctional BCMA-specific cells de novo from naïve CD8+ T cells of healthy volunteers. These T cells exhibited antigen-specific lysis of autologous peptide-loaded cells. Even in the immunosuppressive context of MM, we detected spontaneous memory T-cell responses against P(BCMA)B*18 in patients. By applying CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibition in vitro we induced multifunctional P(BCMA)B*18-specific CD8+ T cells in MM patients lacking preexisting BCMA-directed immune responses. Finally, we could show antigen-specific lysis of autologous peptide-loaded target cells and even MM.1S cells naturally presenting P(BCMA)B*18 using patient-derived P(BCMA)B*18-specific T cells. Hence, this BCMA-derived T-cell epitope represents a promising target for T-cell-based immunotherapy and monitoring following immunotherapy in B-cell malignancy patients."
"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are important for tissue homeostasis and for the initiation of immune responses. Based on their transcriptional regulation and cytokine profiles, ILCs can be categorized into five subsets with defined phenotypes and functional profiles, but they also have the ability to adapt to local environmental cues by changing these profiles. This plasticity raises the question of the extent to which the cytokine production profiles of ILCs are pre-programmed or are a reflection of the tissue microenvironment. Here, we review recent advances in research on ILCs, with a focus on the plasticity of these cells. We highlight the ability of ILCs to communicate with the surrounding microenvironment and discuss the possible consequences of ILC plasticity for our understanding of the biological roles of these cells. Finally, we discuss how we might use this knowledge of ILC plasticity to develop or improve options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."
"Sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) are urgently needed. Urine samples are a non-invasive means to obtain abundant and readily accessible “liquid biopsies”. Herein we used urine liquid biopsies to identify and characterize a novel group of urine-enriched RNAs and metabolites in patients with PCa and normal individuals with or without benign prostatic disease. Differentially expressed RNAs were identified in urine samples by deep sequencing and metabolites in urine were measured by mass spectrometry. mRNA and metabolite profiles were distinct in patients with benign and malignant disease. Integrated analysis of urinary gene expression and metabolite signatures unveiled an aberrant glutamate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle node in prostate cancer-derived cells. Functional validation supported a role for glutamate metabolism and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1)-dependent redox balance in PCa, which could be exploited for novel biomarkers and therapies. In this study, we discovered cancer-specific changes in urinary RNAs and metabolites, paving the way for the development of sensitive and specific urinary PCa diagnostic biomarkers either alone or in combination. Our methodology was based on single void urine samples (i.e., without prostatic massage). The integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data from these liquid biopsies revealed a glutamate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle node that was specific to prostate-derived cancer cells and cancer-specific metabolic changes in urine."
"To determine the relationship between psychological stress with cognitive outcomes in a multi-centre longitudinal study of people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) we assessed three parameters of psychological stress (Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and salivary cortisol) and their relationship with rates of cognitive decline over an 18 month follow up period and conversion to dementia over a 5.5 year period. In 133 aMCI and 68 cognitively intact participants the PSS score was higher in the aMCI compared with control group but neither the RLCQ scores nor salivary cortisol measures were different between groups. In the aMCI group the RLCQ and the PSS showed no significant association with cognitive function at baseline, cognitive decline or with conversion rates to dementia but high salivary cortisol levels were associated with RLCQ scores and poorer cognitive function at baseline and lower rates of cognitive decline. No relationship was found between salivary cortisol levels and conversion rate to dementia. We conclude that psychological stress as measured by the RLCQ or PSS was not associated with adverse cognitive outcomes in an aMCI population and hypothesise that this may reflect diminished cortisol production to psychological stress as the disease progresses."
"Overactivation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of endocrine tumors. Genetic aberrations leading to increased intracellular cAMP or directly affecting PKA subunit expression have been identified in inherited and sporadic endocrine tumors, but are rare indicating the presence of nongenomic pathological PKA activation. In the present study, we examined the impact of hypoxia on PKA activation using human growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary tumors as a model of an endocrine disease displaying PKA-CREB overactivation. We show that hypoxia activates PKA and enhances CREB transcriptional activity and subsequently GH oversecretion. This is due to a previously uncharacterized ability of HIF-1α to suppress the transcription of the PKA regulatory subunit 2B (PRKAR2B) by sequestering Sp1 from the PRKAR2B promoter. The present study reveals a novel mechanism through which the transcription factor HIF-1α transduces environmental signals directly onto PKA activity, without affecting intracellular cAMP concentrations. By identifying a point of interaction between the cellular microenvironment and intracellular enzyme activation, neoplastic, and nonneoplastic diseases involving overactivated PKA pathway may be more efficiently targeted."
"Novel therapies are urgently needed for ovarian cancer, the deadliest gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer has thus far been refractory to immunotherapies that stimulate the host immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. This may be because of a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment and lack of recruitment and activation of immune cells that kill cancer cells. Our previous work showed that epigenetic drugs including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase 6 inhibitors (DNMTis and HDAC6is) individually increase immune signaling in cancer cells. We find that combining DNMTi and HDAC6i results in an amplified type I interferon response, leading to increased cytokine and chemokine expression and higher expression of the MHC I antigen presentation complex in human and mouse ovarian cancer cell lines. Treating mice bearing ID8 Trp53−/− ovarian cancer with HDAC6i/DNMTi led to an increase in tumor-killing cells such as IFNg+ CD8, NK, and NKT cells and a reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with a decrease in MDSCs and PD-1hi CD4 T cells, corresponding with an increase in survival. Thus combining the epigenetic modulators DNMTi and HDAC6i increases anti-tumor immune signaling from cancer cells and has beneficial effects on the ovarian tumor immune microenvironment."
"Under optimized reaction conditions, by directly using the hemostatic drugs 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid (ABA) and tranexamic acid (TA) as separate comonomers of lactic acid (LA), a series of copolymers, P(LA-co-ABA) and P(LA-co-TA), respectively, with different molar feed ratios were designed and synthesized via melt polycondensation and used as biobased polymeric sustained-release hemostatic materials. Their structure, properties and morphology were systematically investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetery (DSC), thermogravimetric (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle and degradation tests. The degradation rate within 7 weeks can reach 77%. When the molar feed ratios of ABA and TA are 20% and 10%, respectively, the corresponding copolymers have relatively lower crystallinity and smaller water contact angle and exhibit the best coagulation performance. In addition, these powdery copolymers have good application convenience, can form a degradable protective membrane similar to a blood scab on the wound surface and continuously exert hemostatic effects to promote wound healing, as anticipated."
"BackgroundForced solar gazing (FSG) appears to be more regularly employed as a method of torture in certain parts of the world than has previously been documented.Subjects and methodsThis study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009–2019.ResultsAll clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients’ associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity.ConclusionFSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases. Ophthalmic examination can carry a risk of re-traumatisation of individuals who have experienced FSG in a context of torture."
"The delta neutrophil index (DNI), which reflects the ratio of circulating immature neutrophils, has been reported to be highly predictive of mortality in systemic inflammation. We investigated the prognostic significance of DNI value for early mortality and neurologic outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest (CA). We retrospectively analyzed the data of eligible patients (<19 years in age). Among 85 patients, 55 subjects (64.7%) survived and 36 (42.4%) showed good outcomes at 30 days after CA. Cox regression analysis revealed that the DNI values immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation, at 24 hours and 48 hours after CA, were related to an increased risk for death within 30 days after CA (P < 0.001). A DNI value of higher than 3.3% at 24 hours could significantly predict both 30-day mortality (hazard ratio: 11.8; P < 0.001) and neurologic outcomes (odds ratio: 8.04; P = 0.003). The C statistic for multivariable prediction models for 30-day mortality (incorporating DNI at 24 hours, compression time, and serum sodium level) was 0.799, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of DNI at 24 hours for poor neurologic outcome was 0.871. Higher DNI was independently associated with 30-day mortality and poor neurologic outcomes after pediatric CA."
"This study aimed to compare the accuracy and reliability of digital versus conventional clinical measurements of the width of keratinized tissue. To this end, the keratinized tissue width was measured at 110 tooth sites in 5 pig jaws. The measurements were made at each site using three-dimensional (3D) scanned images and a periodontal probe. The actual keratinized tissue width was subsequently measured on histologic slides prepared from the same sites, and differences between the histologic slides and the digital and clinical measurements were analyzed to determine their accuracy in two measurement rounds. Furthermore, intrarater and interrater reliabilities were evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Here we show that the mean differences (and lower/upper limits of agreement) between the histologic and the digital/clinical measurements were 0.10 mm (−1.34/1.54 mm) and 1.11 mm (−0.69/2.92 mm), respectively, in the first round of measurements (p < 0.01), and 0.04 mm (−1.52/1.59 mm) and 1.05 mm (−0.37/2.48 mm) in the second round of measurements (p < 0.01). Moreover, we found that the intrarater reliability was higher for the digital measurements (ICC = 0.97, confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.97) than for the clinical measurements (ICC = 0.87, CI = 0.86–0.89; p < 0.01). Taken together, our results demonstrate that digital measurements of the keratinized tissue width using 3D scanned images can replace conventional clinical measurements using a periodontal probe since they are more accurate and reliable."
"ImportanceThe Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity (G-ROP) Study showed that the addition of postnatal weight gain to birth weight and gestational age detects similar numbers of infants with ROP, but requires examination of fewer infants.ObjectiveTo determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of screening with G-ROP compared with conventional screening.Design, setting and participantsWe built a microsimulation model of a 1-year US birth cohort <32 weeks gestation, using data from the G-ROP study. We obtained resource utilization estimates from the G-ROP dataset and from secondary sources, and test characteristics from the G-ROP cohort.ResultsAmong 78,281 infants nationally, screening with G-ROP detected ~25 additional infants with Type 1 ROP. This was accomplished with 36,233 fewer examinations, in 14,073 fewer infants, with annual cost savings of approximately US$2,931,980 through hospital discharge.ConclusionsScreening with G-ROP reduced costs while increasing the detection of ROP compared with current screening guidelines."
"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to play critical roles in tumor initiation and progression. The antisense lncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 is the longest lncRNA of LDLRAD4, and its expression levels, cellular localization, precise function, and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. In this study, we observed that lncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 was located in the nucleus of CRC cells and that lncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 was upregulated in most CRC specimens and cell lines. Overexpression of lncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 was correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. LncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 upregulation enhanced the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro and facilitated CRC metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations suggested that lncRNA LDLRAD4-AS1 could decrease the expression of LDLRAD4 by disrupting the stability of LDLRAD4 mRNA, resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through upregulating Snail, thereby promoting metastasis in CRC. Our results demonstrated a previously unrecognized LDLRAD4-AS1-LDLRAD4-Snail regulatory axis involved in epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation that contributes to CRC progression and metastasis."
"The root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Chishao, CS) and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (Chuanxiong, CX) were widely used as a drug pair in Chinese Medicine, and the combination of CS and CX showed a more significant inhibition on neuronal apoptosis in our previous study. In the present study, total paeony glycosides (TPGs) from CS and total ligustici phenolic acids (TLPAs) from CX were combined to evaluate the synergistic effects against focal cerebral ischemia both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of TPGs and TLPAs at 7:3 had the best anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effect on OGD-induced HUVEC. Additionally, the infarction area proportion and neuron apoptosis of rats by TPGs:TLPAs (7:3) was significantly lower than their alone in MCAO rats. Moreover, TPGs: TLPAs of 7:3 showed a more significant effect on decreasing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and increasing the protein expression or mRNA level of TIMP-1 than other combinations. The optimal ratio of TPGs and TLPAs at 7:3 could bring more remarkable protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia in MCAO rats by alleviating oxidative stress, inflammatory and neuronal apoptosis to protect the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present study provided benefical evidence for clinical application of CS and CX as a “drug pair”."
"DNA methylation may be involved in development of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but previous epigenome-wide association studies were conducted among cases with clinically diagnosed diabetes. Using multiple pre-disease peripheral blood samples on the Illumina 450 K and EPIC platforms, we investigated longitudinal methylation differences between 87 T1D cases and 87 controls from the prospective Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) cohort. Change in methylation with age differed between cases and controls in 10 regions. Average longitudinal methylation differed between cases and controls at two genomic positions and 28 regions. Some methylation differences were detectable and consistent as early as birth, including before and after the onset of preclinical islet autoimmunity. Results map to transcription factors, other protein coding genes, and non-coding regions of the genome with regulatory potential. The identification of methylation differences that predate islet autoimmunity and clinical diagnosis may suggest a role for epigenetics in T1D pathogenesis; however, functional validation is warranted."
"Analgesic effect of transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) in lower major abdominal laparoscopic surgery with about 5 cm of maximum surgical scar has been controversial. We hypothesized that TAP block has benefits, so the analgesic effect of TAP block after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) was evaluated. One hundred patients were enrolled in this prospective, double-blinded, randomized study. Standardized general anesthesia with wound infiltration on camera port and fentanyl dose limit of 3 µg/kg was provided. Ultrasound-guided, single-shot subcostal TAP block with either 0.375% ropivacaine (Ropivacaine group, 48 patients) or normal saline (Control group, 52 patients) was performed by anesthesiologist in charge (34 anesthesiologists) after surgical procedure. Pain score using numerical rating scale (NRS) and postoperative intravenous fentanyl were evaluated for the first 24 postoperative hours. Median values (interquartile range) of NRS scores when the patients were transferred to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were 5 (2–7) in Ropivacaine group and 6 (4–8) in Control group at rest (P = 0.03), 5 (2–8) in Ropivacaine group and 7 (5–8) in Control group during movement (P < 0.01). These significant differences disappeared at the time of discharging PACU. Fentanyl doses for the first 24 postoperative hours were 210 µg (120–360) in Ropivacaine group and 200 µg (120–370) in Control group (P = 0.79). These results indicated that subcostal TAP block by anesthesiologists of varied level of training reduced postoperative pain immediate after RALP. TAP block had fundamental analgesic effect, but this benefit was too small to reduce postoperative 24-hour fentanyl consumption."
"We developed and characterized a canine model of outer retinal degeneration induced by sodium iodate (SI) intravitreal injection after vitrectomy. In the preliminary study, we repeatedly injected SI intravitreally into the eyes of three canines to develop outer retinal degeneration two weeks after vitrectomy. Based on the preliminary study, a single dose of either 1.2 mg or 1.0 mg SI/0.05 mL was also injected (1.2 mg in n = 5 canines, 1.0 mg in n = 2 canines). Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG), and histological examinations were performed at baseline and following intravitreal injection. In the preliminary study, after a 0.5-mg SI injection and a 1.0-mg SI injection and after two 0.8-mg SI injections, retinal degeneration with retinal thinning was observed on OCT imaging. In the second study, after a single 1.0- or 1.2-mg SI injection, outer retinal degeneration was induced. All eyes showed diffuse outer retinal degeneration on OCT and a loss of both cone and rod responses in ERG. Histological examination also showed the loss of outer retinal layer. Intravitreally injected SI (1.0–1.2 mg) in a vitrectomized canine model induced outer retinal degeneration effectively, and could be evaluated through in vivo ophthalmic examination."
"To compare the outcomes of open preperitoneal repair (OPR) with the use of mesh and open suture repair (OSR) without mesh via inguinal approach for the treatment of emergency femoral hernia (FH). The primary outcome was the postoperative complication and the secondary outcomes were the recurrence rate of FH and the postoperative comfort level at the surgical site. 104 patients with emergency FHs were included, of whom 51 patients were treated with OPR, 53 patients were treated with OSR. Between the two groups, no significant difference was found in surgical site infection (SSI) (P = 0.801) or seroma (P = 0.843), while there was significant difference in the improvement of comfort at the surgical site (P = 0.013). The results of the 2-year follow-up demonstrated 1 and 8 cases of recurrence in the OPR and OSR group respectively, which was statistically significant (HR, 8.193 [95% CI, 1.024 to 65.547], P = 0.047). Compared with OSR, OPR with the use of mesh did not increase the risk of SSI and was safe to apply even under the condition of an emergency FH operation with intestine resection; OPR could reduce the recurrence rate of FH and improve the comfort at the surgical site."
"The reactivation of HIV latency cell will be necessary to curing HIV infection. Although many latency-reversal agents (LRAs) have proven effective to reactivate the latency cell, there is a lack of any systematic analysis of the molecular targets of these LRAs and related pathways in the context of transcriptome. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of the target profile of bryostatin and transcriptome of the reactivated CD4+ T cells after exposing to bryostatin. The result showed a distinct gene expression profile between latency cells and bryostatin reactivated cells. We found bryostatin can target multiple types of protein other than only protein kinase C. Functional network analysis of the target profile and differential expressed genes suggested that bryostatin may activate a few novel pathways such as pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism and p53 signaling pathway, besides commonly known pathways DNA replication, cell cycle and so on. The results suggest that bryostatin may reactivate the HIV-latent cells through up-regulation of pyrimidine and purine metabolism or through starting the cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by up-regulation of p53 signaling pathway. Our study provides some novel insights into the role of bryostatin and its affected pathways in controlling HIV latency and reactivation."
"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a central role in cancer initiation, progression, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence in patients. Here we present Capicua (CIC), a developmental transcriptional repressor, as a suppressor of CSC properties in breast cancer cells. CIC deficiency critically enhances CSC self-renewal and multiple CSC subpopulations of breast cancer cells without altering their growth rate or invasiveness. Loss of CIC relieves repression of ETV4 and ETV5 expression, consequently promoting self-renewal capability, EpCAM+/CD44+/CD24low/− expression, and ALDH activity. In xenograft models, CIC deficiency significantly increases CSC frequency and drives tumor initiation through derepression of ETV4. Consistent with the experimental data, the CD44high/CD24low CSC-like feature is inversely correlated with CIC levels in breast cancer patients. We also identify SOX2 as a downstream target gene of CIC that partly promotes CSC properties. Taken together, our study demonstrates that CIC suppresses breast cancer formation via restricting cancer stemness and proposes CIC as a potential regulator of stem cell maintenance."
"Leiomyomas, adenomyosis, and endometriosis are reported to be risk factors for endometrial carcinoma (EC), and adenomyosis and endometriosis also for ovarian carcinoma (OC). We aimed to describe the prevalence of these conditions in EC patients with or without an OC diagnosis, and to investigate their relationship with EC risk and prognostic factors in these patients. We evaluated the co-existence of these three conditions in 1399 EC patients, and compared the prevalence of epidemiological risk factors and tumor prognostic features in patients with each condition versus not. Prevalence of conditions was also assessed in the subset of patients with prior/concurrent OC. The observed coexistence of leiomyomas, adenomyosis and endometriosis significantly deviated from that expected (P = 1.2 × 10−8). Patients were more likely to: report a younger age at menarche (PTrend = 0.004) if they had leiomyomas; have used oral contraceptives (P = 6.6 × 10−5) or had ≥2 full-term pregnancies (PTrend = 2.0 × 10−9) if they had adenomyosis; be diagnosed with EC at younger age (P = 5.0 × 10−11) if they had endometriosis. Patients with prior/concurrent OC were more likely to be diagnosed at younger age (P = 5.0 × 10−5), have endometriosis (P = 9.9 × 10−7), and present with higher stage EC (PTrend = 6.6 × 10−5). These findings justify further consideration of these gynecologic conditions as independent risk and prognostic factors for EC."
"The jugular venous pulse (JVP) is the reference physiological signal used to detect right atrial and central venous pressure (CVP) abnormalities in cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) diagnosis. Invasive central venous line catheterization has always been the gold standard method to extract it reliably. However, due to all the risks it entails, novel non-invasive approaches, exploiting distance cameras and lasers, have recently arisen to measure the JVP at the external and internal jugular veins. These remote options however, constraint patients to very specific body positions in front of the imaging system, making it inadequate for long term monitoring. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) can be an alternative for extracting the JVP from the anterior jugular veins, in a contact manner. Neck JVP-PPG signals were recorded from 20 healthy participants, together with reference ECG and arterial finger PPG signals for validation. B-mode ultrasound imaging of the internal jugular vein also proved the validity of the proposed method. The results show that is possible to identify the characteristic a, c, v pressure waves in the novel signals, and confirm their cardiac-cycle timings in consistency with established cardiac physiology. Wavelet coherence values (close to 1 and phase shifts of ±180°) corroborated that neck contact JVP-PPG pulses were negatively correlated with arterial finger PPG. Average JVP waveforms for each subject showed typical JVP pulses contours except for the singularity of an unknown ""u"" wave occurring after the c wave, in half of the cohort. This work is of great significance for the future of CVDs diagnosis, as it has the potential to reduce the risks associated with conventional catheterization and enable continuous non-invasive point-of-care monitoring of CVP, without restricting patients to limited postures."
"Nigeria has the highest number of AIDS-related deaths in the world. In this study, we characterised the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology by analysing 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences collected 1999–2014 from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria using state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences), CRF43_02G (16%), and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries."
The structure-specific endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 participates in multiple DNA damage repair pathways including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and inter-strand crosslink repair (ICLR). How XPF-ERCC1 is catalytically activated by DNA junction substrates is not currently understood. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of both DNA-free and DNA-bound human XPF-ERCC1. DNA-free XPF-ERCC1 adopts an auto-inhibited conformation in which the XPF helical domain masks the ERCC1 (HhH)2 domain and restricts access to the XPF catalytic site. DNA junction engagement releases the ERCC1 (HhH)2 domain to couple with the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease/nuclease-like domains. Structure-function data indicate xeroderma pigmentosum patient mutations frequently compromise the structural integrity of XPF-ERCC1. Fanconi anaemia patient mutations in XPF often display substantial in-vitro activity but are resistant to activation by ICLR recruitment factor SLX4. Our data provide insights into XPF-ERCC1 architecture and catalytic activation.
"The expression of synthetic receptors in primary T cells enables the programming of user-defined responses when designing T-cell therapies. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that have demonstrated efficacy in cancer therapy by targeting immobilized antigens on the surface of malignant cells. Recently, we showed they can also rewire T-cell responses to soluble ligands. In contrast to other synthetic receptors, CARs are not only readily engineered by rational design, but also clinically translatable, with robust function in primary human T cells. This protocol discusses design principles for CARs responsive to soluble ligands and delineates steps for producing T cells expressing synthetic receptors. Functional assays for quantifying the ability of CAR T cells to sense and respond to soluble ligands are also presented. This protocol provides a framework for proficient immune-cell researchers to test novel T-cell therapies targeting soluble ligands in <2 weeks."
"Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by mixed production of Th1/2 cytokines and the disease is established by an enhanced level of Th2 cytokine. CD4+ T cells are main cell type which produces Th1/2 cytokine in the host upon Leishmania infection. However, the regulatory mechanism for Th1/2 production is not well understood. In this study, we co-cultured mice CD4+ T cells with Leishmania donovani infected and uninfected macrophage for the identification of dysregulated miRNAs in CD4+ T cells by next-generation sequencing. Here, we identified 604 and 613 known miRNAs in CD4+ T cells in control and infected samples respectively and a total of only 503 miRNAs were common in both groups. The expression analysis revealed that 112 miRNAs were up and 96 were down-regulated in infected groups, compared to uninfected control. Nineteen up-regulated and 17 down-regulated miRNAs were statistically significant (p < 0.05), which were validated by qPCR. Further, using insilco approach, we identified the gene targets of significant miRNAs on the basis of CD4+ T cell biology. Eleven up-regulated miRNAs and 9 down-regulated miRNAs were associated with the cellular immune responses and Th1/2 dichotomy upon Leishmania donovani infection. The up-regulated miRNAs targeted transcription factors that promote differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards Th1 phenotype. While down-regulated miRNAs targeted the transcription factors that facilitate differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards Th2 populations. The GO and pathway enrichment analysis also showed that the identified miRNAs target the pathway and genes related to CD4+ T cell biology which plays important role in Leishmania donovani infection."
"If you think you are in control of your behavior, think again. Evidence suggests that behavioral modifications, as development and persistence of depression, maybe the consequence of a complex network of communication between macro and micro-organisms capable of modifying the physiological axis of the host. Some parasites cause significant nutritional deficiencies for the host and impair the effectiveness of cognitive processes such as memory, teaching or non-verbal intelligence. Bacterial communities mediate the establishment of parasites and vice versa but this complexity approach remains little explored. We study the gut microbiota-parasite interactions using novel techniques of network analysis using data of individuals from two indigenous communities in Guerrero, Mexico. Our results suggest that Ascaris lumbricoides induce a gut microbiota perturbation affecting its network properties and also subnetworks of key species related to depression, translating in a loss of emergence. Studying these network properties changes is particularly important because recent research has shown that human health is characterized by a dynamic trade-off between emergence and self-organization, called criticality. Emergence allows the systems to generate novel information meanwhile self-organization is related to the system’s order and structure. In this way, the loss of emergence means a depart from criticality and ultimately loss of health."
"Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder affecting the metabolism of phenylalanine (phe) due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This disorder is characterized by an elevated phe blood level, which can lead to severe intellectual disabilities in newborns. The current strategy to prevent these devastating consequences is limited to a life-long phe-free diet, which implies major lifestyle changes and restrictions. Recently, an injectable enzyme replacement therapy, Pegvaliase, has been approved for treating phenylketonuria, but is associated with significant side-effects. In this study a phe-metabolizing system suitable for oral delivery is designed to overcome the need for daily injections. Active phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), an enzyme that catalyses phe metabolism, is loaded into mesoporous silica microparticles (MSP) with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 35 nm. The surface of the MSP is lined with a semipermeable barrier to allow permeation of phe while blocking digestive enzymes that degrade PAL. The enzymatic activity can be partially preserved in vitro by coating the MSP with poly(allylamine) and poly(acrylic acid)-bowman birk (protease inhibitor) conjugate. The carrier system presented herein may provide a general approach to overcome gastro-intestinal proteolytic digestion and to deliver active enzymes to the intestinal lumen for prolonged local action."
"BackgroundEpigenetic therapy through demethylation of 5-methylcytosine has been largely ineffective in treating lung cancer, most likely due to poor tissue distribution with oral or subcutaneous delivery of drugs such as 5-azacytidine (5AZA). An inhalable, stable dry powder formulation of 5AZA was developed.MethodsPharmacokinetics of inhaled dry powder and aqueous formulations of 5AZA were compared to an injected formulation. Efficacy studies and effect of therapy on the epigenome were conducted in an orthotopic rat lung cancer model for inhaled formulations.ResultsInhaled dry powder 5AZA showed superior pharmacokinetic properties in lung, liver, brain and blood compared to the injected formulation and for all tissues except lung compared to an inhaled aqueous formulation. Only dry powder 5AZA was detected in brain (~4-h half-life). Inhaled dry powder was superior to inhaled aqueous 5AZA in reducing tumour burden 70–95%. Superiority of inhaled 5AZA dry powder was linked to effectively reprogramming the cancer genome through demethylation and gene expression changes in cancer signalling and immune pathways.ConclusionsThese findings could lead to widespread use of this drug as the first inhaled dry powder therapeutic for treating local and metastatic lung cancer, for adjuvant therapy, and in combination with immunotherapy to improve patient survival."
"Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) encode essential alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. While alcohol use is associated with spontaneously deep intracerebral haemorrhage (SDICH), particularly in males, the activities and genetic variants of ADH and ALDH may affect SDICH development. This case-control study was conducted to identify the interaction of alcohol use and SDICH with five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): ADH1B rs1229984, ADH1C rs2241894, ALDH2 rs671, ALDH2 rs886205, and ALDH2 rs4648328. We enrolled 208 patients with SDICH and 244 healthy controls in a Taiwanese population. ALDH2 rs671 was significantly associated with SDICH in the dominant (P < 0.001) and additive models (P = 0.007). ALDH2 rs4648328 was borderline significantly associated with SDICH in the recessive (P = 0.024) or additive models (P = 0.030). In alcohol-using patients, the ALDH2 rs671 GG genotype was associated with SDICH risk compared to the GA+AA genotype (P = 0.010). ADH1B rs1229984, ADH1C rs2241894, and ALDH2 rs886205 did not demonstrate association with SDICH. Thus, the ALDH2 rs671 GG genotype is a risk factor for SDICH. Because the genetic distributions of ALDH2 rs671 exhibited strong ethnic heterogeneity, further studies in different populations are needed to validate these findings."
"Current cochlear implants (CIs) are semi-implantable devices with an externally worn sound processor that hosts the microphone and sound processor. A fully implantable device, however, would ultimately be desirable as it would be of great benefit to recipients. While some prototypes have been designed and used in a few select cases, one main stumbling block is the sound input. Specifically, subdermal implantable microphone technology has been poised with physiologic issues such as sound distortion and signal attenuation under the skin. Here we propose an alternative method that utilizes a physiologic response composed of an electrical field generated by the sensory cells of the inner ear to serve as a sound source microphone for fully implantable hearing technology such as CIs. Electrophysiological results obtained from 14 participants (adult and pediatric) document the feasibility of capturing speech properties within the electrocochleography (ECochG) response. Degradation of formant properties of the stimuli /da/ and /ba/ are evaluated across various degrees of hearing loss. Preliminary results suggest proof-of-concept of using the ECochG response as a microphone is feasible to capture vital properties of speech. However, further signal processing refinement is needed in addition to utilization of an intracochlear recording location to likely improve signal fidelity."
"Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) provide bio-markers for kidney and urogenital diseases. Centrifugation is the most common method used to enrich uEVs. However, a majority of studies to date have focused on the ultracentrifugation pellet, potentially losing a novel source of important biomarkers that could be obtained at lower centrifugation. Thus, the aim of this study is to rigorously characterize for the first time uEVs in the low speed pellet and determine the minimal volume of urine required for proteomic analysis (≥9.0 mL urine) and gene ontology classification identified 75% of the protein as extracellular exosomes. Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy (≥3.0 mL urine) provided evidence of a heterogeneous population of EVs for size and morphology independent of uromodulin filaments. Western blot detected several specific uEV kidney and EV markers (≥4.5 mL urine per lane). microRNAs quantification by qPCR was possible with urine volume as low as 0.5 mL. Particle enumeration with tunable resistive pulse sensing, nano particles tracking analysis and single EV high throughput imaging flow cytometry are possible starting from 0.5 and 3.0 mL of urine respectively. This work characterizes a neglected source of uEVs and provides guidance with regard to volume of urine necessary to carry out multi-omic studies and reveals novel aspects of uEV analysis such as autofluorescence of podocyte origin."
"Besides lifetime risks, we estimated life expectancy (LE), expected years of life lost (EYLL), lifetime costs, and cost-per-LY (life-year) stratified by different stages of esophageal cancer (EC). From the Taiwan Cancer Registry, we collected 14,420 EC to estimate the incidence rates during 2008–2014. They were followed to 2015 to obtain the survival function, which was extrapolated to lifetime by a semiparametric method. We abstracted the monthly healthcare expenditures from the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance, which were multiplied with the corresponding survival probabilities to quantify lifetime cost and cost-per-LY after adjustments. About 93.7% of patients were male; 90.8% had squamous cell carcinoma. Most patients were diagnosed at advanced stages, with 44.6% and 28.3% at stages III and IV. The lifetime risk of EC in males increased in Taiwan with a cumulative incidence rate (CIR30–84) of 0.0146% (2008~2010) to 0.0165% (2013–2014). The EYLL for stages I-IV were 15.8, 17.5, 20.5, and 22.5, while the average of cost-per-LY for stages I-IV were US$ 6,987, $8,776, $12,153, and $22,426. EC in Taiwan appears to have shifted into younger ages groups and incidence is still increasing. Strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted to improve the cost-effectiveness and control of this cancer."
"Lipid-protein complexes are the basis of pulmonary surfactants covering the respiratory surface and mediating gas exchange in lungs. Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial lipid overexpressed in mammalian lungs infected by bacterial pneumonia. In addition, increased oxygen supply (hyperoxia) is a pathological factor also critical in bacterial pneumonia. In this paper we fabricate a micrometer-size graphene-based sensor to measure oxygen permeation through pulmonary membranes. Combining oxygen sensing, X-ray scattering, and Atomic Force Microscopy, we show that mammalian pulmonary membranes suffer a structural transformation induced by cardiolipin. We observe that cardiolipin promotes the formation of periodic protein–free inter–membrane contacts with rhombohedral symmetry. Membrane contacts, or stalks, promote a significant increase in oxygen gas permeation which may bear significance for alveoli gas exchange imbalance in pneumonia."
"E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) play essential roles in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis under normal and stress conditions, as well as in disease states, particularly in cancer. However, the role of E3s in the initiation of human tumors is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that genetic ablation of the HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 induces carcinogenesis in mice; but whether and how these findings are pertinent to the inception of human cancer remain unknown. Here we show that SMURF2 is essential to protect human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from malignant transformation, and its depletion converts HDFs into tumorigenic entity. This phenomenon was associated with the radical changes in chromatin structural and epigenetic landscape, dysregulated gene expression and cell-cycle control, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and impaired DNA damage response. Furthermore, we show that SMURF2-mediated tumor suppression is interlinked with SMURF2’s ability to regulate the expression of two central chromatin modifiers—an E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20 and histone methyltransferase EZH2. Silencing these factors significantly reduced the growth and transformation capabilities of SMURF2-depleted cells. Finally, we demonstrate that SMURF2-compromised HDFs are highly tumorigenic in nude mice. These findings suggest the critical role that SMURF2 plays in preventing malignant alterations, chromosomal instability and cancer."
"Persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or diabetes have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and higher death rates compared to the general population. This study used data from the population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) and the Norwegian Cause of Death registry to compare all-cause mortality rates for RA or diabetes patients to the general population. We used Cox regression with age as time variable, adjusting for sex, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, total cholesterol, creatinine and previous CVD. To achieve proportional hazards, an interaction term with an age group variable (≤75 years or >75 years) was included for diabetes, smoking and previous CVD. Median follow-up was 18.1 years. Mortality occurred for 123 (32%) of the RA patients, 1,280 (44%) of the diabetes patients, 17 (52%) of the patients with both diseases and 11,641 (18%) of the controls. Both diseases were associated with statistically significantly increased mortality rates. The hazard ratio (HR) for RA was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.03-1.44). The HR of diabetes was 1.82 (1.60-2.04) for individuals ≤75 years old and 1.49 (1.39-1.59) for individuals >75 years. Diabetes had a significantly higher HR for death than RA for participants ≤75 years, but not significantly different for participants >75 years."
"Office cystoscopy may be associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in up to 10–20% of patients. Current practice of surgical part preparation in males with povidone-iodine excludes distal urethra in males, leaving a possibility for resident intra-urethral flora to cause post-procedural UTI. We designed this randomized study to assess whether additional cleaning of distal urethra with povidone-iodine solution can help reduce post-procedural incidence of UTIs in this setting. Additionally, urethral swab culture was done in the entire cohort to identify the prevalent microflora in the distal male urethra and to evaluate its role in causation of post-procedural UTI. Using a specialized urethral swab culture methodology, 85% males demonstrated some bacteria and 16% showed common uro-pathogens. 28 (14.5%) cases had post-procedure culture positive UTI. The incidence of UTI in control group (22%) was significantly more than the intervention group (7%) (p value <0.007). This result strongly supports inclusion of distal urethral irrigation with povidone-iodine in males before office cystoscopy, even when pre-procedure mid-stream urine culture is sterile."
"In recent years, there is a growing interest towards the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles, particularly from plants; however, yet no published study on the synthesis of ZnO.NPs using the Deverra tortuosa extract. Through this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO.NPs) have been synthesized based on using the environmentally benign extract of the aerial parts of D. tortuosa as a reducing and capping agent. ZnO.NPs synthesis was confirmed using UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-TEM). The qualitative and quantitative analyses of plant extract were done. The potential anticancer activity was in vitro investigated against two cancer cell lines (human colon adenocarcinoma “Caco-2” and human lung adenocarcinoma “A549”) compared to their activities on the human lung fibroblast cell line (WI38) using the MTT assay. Both the aqueous extract and ZnO.NPs showed a remarkable selective cytotoxicity against the two examined cancer cell lines."
"Numerous studies have investigated the association of MIR499A rs3746444 polymorphism with breast cancer susceptibility, but the results have been inconsistent. In this work, we performed a meta-analysis to obtain a more reliable estimate of the association between the polymorphism and susceptibility to breast cancer. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and Wanfang databases up to January 2020. A total of 14 studies involving 6,797 cases and 8,534 controls were included for analysis under five genetic models: homozygous (GG vs. AA), heterozygous (AG vs. AA), dominant (AG + GG vs. AA), recessive (GG vs. AA + AG) and allele (G vs. A). A statistically significant association was observed between the polymorphism and an increased breast cancer susceptibility under all genetic models (homozygous, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03–1.71, P = 0.03; heterozygous, OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00–1.16, P = 0.04; dominant, OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02–1.30; P = 0.03; recessive, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06–1.72, P = 0.01; allele, OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.00–1.26, P = 0.04). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity suggested that significant association was present only among Asians, but not Caucasians. In conclusion, MIR499A rs3746444 polymorphism was significantly associated with breast cancer susceptibility among Asians, suggesting its potential use as a genetic risk marker in this population."
"Schistosomiasis is a severe neglected tropical disease caused by trematodes and transmitted by freshwater snails. Snails are known to be highly tolerant to agricultural pesticides. However, little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of pesticide pollution in areas endemic for schistosomiasis, where people live in close contact with non-sanitized freshwaters. In complementary laboratory and field studies on Kenyan inland areas along Lake Victoria, we show that pesticide pollution is a major driver in increasing the occurrence of host snails and thus the risk of schistosomiasis transmission. In the laboratory, snails showed higher insecticide tolerance to commonly found pesticides than associated invertebrates, in particular to the neonicotinoid Imidacloprid and the organophosphate Diazinon. In the field, we demonstrated at 48 sites that snails were present exclusively in habitats characterized by pesticide pollution and eutrophication. Our analysis revealed that insensitive snails dominated over their less tolerant competitors. The study shows for the first time that in the field, pesticide concentrations considered “safe” in environmental risk assessment have indirect effects on human health. Thus we conclude there is a need for rethinking the environmental risk of low pesticide concentrations and of integrating agricultural mitigation measures in the control of schistosomiasis."
"Haematological malignancies were previously thought to be driven solely by genetic or epigenetic lesions within haematopoietic cells. However, the niches that maintain and regulate daily production of blood and immune cells are now increasingly being recognized as having an important role in the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of haematological malignancies. Within haematopoietic cells, the accumulation of a small number of recurrent mutations initiates malignancy. Concomitantly, specific alterations of the niches, which support haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, can act as predisposition events, facilitating mutant haematopoietic cell survival and expansion as well as contributing to malignancy progression and providing protection of malignant cells from chemotherapy, ultimately leading to relapse. In this Perspective, we summarize our current understanding of the composition and function of the specialized haematopoietic niches of the bone marrow during health and disease. We discuss disease mechanisms (rather than malignancy subtypes) to provide a comprehensive description of key niche-associated pathways that are shared across multiple haematological malignancies. These mechanisms include primary driver mutations in bone marrow niche cells, changes associated with increased hypoxia, angiogenesis and inflammation as well as metabolic reprogramming by stromal niche cells. Consequently, remodelling of bone marrow niches can facilitate immune evasion and activation of survival pathways favouring malignant haematopoietic cell maintenance, defence against excessive reactive oxygen species and protection from chemotherapy. Lastly, we suggest guidelines for the handling and biobanking of patient samples and analysis of the niche to ensure that basic research identifying therapeutic targets can be more efficiently translated to the clinic. The hope is that integrating knowledge of how bone marrow niches contribute to haematological disease predisposition, initiation, progression and response to therapy into future clinical practice will likely improve the treatment of these disorders."
"Cationic host defence peptides (CHDP), also known as antimicrobial peptides, are naturally occurring peptides that can combat infections through their direct microbicidal properties and/or by influencing the host’s immune responses. The unique ability of CHDP to control infections as well as resolve harmful inflammation has generated interest in harnessing the properties of these peptides to develop new therapies for infectious diseases, chronic inflammatory disorders and wound healing. Various strategies have been used to design synthetic optimized peptides, with negligible toxicity. Here, we focus on the progress made in understanding the scope of functions of CHDP and the emerging potential clinical applications of CHDP-based therapies."
"Spinocerebellar ataxias 17 (SCA17) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the TATA box-binding protein (TBP). The selective neurodegeneration in the cerebellum in SCA17 raises the question of why ubiquitously expressed polyQ proteins can cause neurodegeneration in distinct brain regions in different polyQ diseases. By expressing mutant TBP in different brain regions in adult wild-type mice via stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus, we found that adult cerebellar neurons are particularly vulnerable to mutant TBP. In SCA17 knock-in mice, mutant TBP inhibits SP1-mediated gene transcription to down-regulate INPP5A, a protein that is highly abundant in the cerebellum. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Inpp5a in the cerebellum of wild-type mice leads to Purkinje cell degeneration, and Inpp5a overexpression decreases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels and ameliorates Purkinje cell degeneration in SCA17 knock-in mice. Our findings demonstrate the important contribution of a tissue-specific protein to the polyQ protein-mediated selective neuropathology."
"The limited efficacy of available antidepressant therapies may be due to how they affect the underlying brain network. The purpose of this study was to develop a melancholic MDD biomarker to identify critically important functional connections (FCs), and explore their association to treatments. Resting state fMRI data of 130 individuals (65 melancholic major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, 65 healthy controls) were included to build a melancholic MDD classifier, and 10 FCs were selected by our sparse machine learning algorithm. This biomarker generalized to a drug-free independent cohort of melancholic MDD, and did not generalize to other MDD subtypes or other psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we found that antidepressants had a heterogeneous effect on the identified FCs of 25 melancholic MDDs. In particular, it did impact the FC between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)/inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, ranked as the second ‘most important’ FC based on the biomarker weights, whilst other eight FCs were normalized. Given that left DLPFC has been proposed as an explicit target of depression treatments, this suggest that the limited efficacy of antidepressants might be compensated by combining therapies with targeted treatment as an optimized approach in the future."
"Pathogenic variants in the PSEN1 gene are known to be the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease but there are few data on the frequency and spectrum of PSEN1 variants in Korea. In this study, we investigated PSEN1 variants in a consecutive series of clinically suspicious early-onset familial AD (EOFAD) Korean patients and their clinical characteristics and imaging findings. From January 2007 to December 2013, EOFAD patients with very early onset AD (<50 yr), early onset AD (<60 yr) with two or more relatives with AD, and early onset AD (<60 yr) with one or more first-degree relatives with very early onset AD (<50 yr) were enrolled in this study. Sequence analysis of the PSEN1 gene was performed by Sanger sequencing. Neuroimaging data and conventional brain MRIs and FDG-PET and/or [11C] PiB-PET scans were analyzed in patients with PSEN1 variants. Among the 28 patients with EOFAD, six (21.4%, 6/28) patients had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the PSEN1 gene. Two pathogenic variants were p.Glu120Lys and p.Ser170Phe and four likely pathogenic variants were p.Thr119Ile, p.Tyr159Cys, p.Leu282Pro, and p.Ala285Ser. Two patients had variants of unknown significance, p.Tyr389His and p.Tyr389Ser. EOFAD patients with PSEN1 variants showed early AD onset, frequent visuospatial dysfunction, movement disorders, and rapid disease progression. Brain MRIs revealed diffuse cortical atrophy, including parietal lobe atrophy, and/or hippocampal atrophy. FDG-PET scans also revealed significant hypometabolism in the bilateral temporo-parietal regions. Our findings provide insight to better understand the genetic background of Korean EOFAD patients."
"Metastasis is a major cause of high recurrence and poor survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), although the mechanisms associated with this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we report a novel mechanism by which SOX13 promotes CRC metastasis by transactivating SNAI2 and c-MET. SOX13 overexpression was significantly correlated with more aggressive clinicopathological features of CRC and indicated poor prognosis in two independent cohorts of CRC patients (cohort I, n = 363; cohort II, n = 390). Overexpression of SOX13-promoted CRC migration, invasion, and metastasis, whereas SOX13 downregulation caused the opposite effects. Further mechanistic investigation identified SNAI2 and MET as important target genes of SOX13 using serial deletion and site-directed mutagenesis luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, as well as functional complementation analyses. In addition, SOX13 was shown to be a direct target of HGF/STAT3 signaling, and the c-MET inhibitor crizotinib blocked the HGF/STAT3/SOX13/c-MET axis, significantly inhibiting SOX13-mediated CRC migration, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, in clinical CRC tissues, SOX13 expression was positively correlated with the expression of SNAI2, c-MET, and HGF. CRC patients with positive coexpression of SOX13/SNAI2, SOX13/c-MET, or HGF/SOX13 exhibited a worse prognosis. In summary, SOX13 is a promising prognostic biomarker in patients with CRC, and blocking the HGF/STAT3/SOX13/c-MET axis with crizotinib could be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent SOX13-mediated CRC metastasis."
"Venetoclax, an FDA-approved Bcl-2 selective inhibitor for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is tolerated well in elderly patients with AML and has good overall response rates; however, resistance remains a concern. In this study, we show that targeting CDK9 with voruciclib in combination with venetoclax results in synergistic antileukemic activity against AML cell lines and primary patient samples. CDK9 inhibition enhances venetoclax activity through downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-Myc. However, downregulation of Mcl-1 is transient, which necessitates an intermittent treatment schedule to allow for repeated downregulation of Mcl-1. Accordingly, an every other day schedule of the CDK9 inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo in enhancing the efficacy of venetoclax. Our preclinical data provide a rationale for an intermittent drug administration schedule for the clinical evaluation of the combination treatment for AML."
"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) vertical transmission causes fetal and neonatal colonization and diseases. However, there is scarcity of data in low-income countries including Ethiopia. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 98 GBS positive mothers, and their newborns to find proportion of vertical transmission. GBS was identified from swabs by using recommended methods and vertical transmission at birth was confirmed by the culture of body surface swabs of newborns within 30 minutes following birth. GBS positivity among swabbed specimens collected for other purposes was 160/1540 (10.4%); 98 were from 385 recto-vaginal swabs of pregnant women, and 62 were from 1,155 swabs of the 385 births. Of the 98 GBS positive cases, 62 newborns were GBS colonized with vertical transmission proportion of 63.3%(95% CI: 54.1–72.4%). We identified that the proportion of vertical transmission in this study was within the range of other many global studies, but higher than recently published data in Ethiopia. Maternal educational level, employment and lower ANC visit were significantly associated risk factors to GBS vertical transmission. Efforts need to be made to screen pregnant women during antenatal care and to provide IAP to GBS positive cases to reduce mother to newborn vertical transmission."
"The DBCG89D trial randomized high-risk early breast cancer patients to adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil). Prosigna assays were performed by researchers with no access to clinical data. Time to distant recurrence (DR) was the primary endpoint, time to recurrence (TR) and overall survival (OS) secondary. Among the 980 Danish patients enrolled, Prosigna results were obtained in 686. Continuous ROR score was associated with DR for CMF (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.20, 95% CI 1.09–1.33), and for CEF (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92–1.18), Pinteraction = 0.06. DR was significantly longer in CEF compared to CMF treated patients with Her2-enriched tumors (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38–0.86), but not in patients with luminal tumors. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was significant for TR and OS. In this prospective-retrospective analysis, patients with Her2-enriched breast cancer derived substantial benefit from anthracycline chemotherapy whereas anthracyclines are not an essential component of chemotherapy for patients with luminal subtypes. The benefit of CEF vs. CMF correlated with increasing ROR Score."
"Osteosarcoma, an aggressive malignant cancer, has a high lung metastasis rate and lacks therapeutic target. Here, we reported that chromobox homolog 4 (CBX4) was overexpressed in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. CBX4 promoted metastasis by transcriptionally up-regulating Runx2 via the recruitment of GCN5 to the Runx2 promoter. The phosphorylation of CBX4 at T437 by casein kinase 1α (CK1α) facilitated its ubiquitination at both K178 and K280 and subsequent degradation by CHIP, and this phosphorylation of CBX4 could be reduced by TNFα. Consistently, CK1α suppressed cell migration and invasion through inhibition of CBX4. There was a reverse correlation between CK1α and CBX4 in osteosarcoma tissues, and CK1α was a valuable marker to predict clinical outcomes in osteosarcoma patients with metastasis. Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) as a selective activator of CK1α could inhibit osteosarcoma metastasis via the CK1α/CBX4 axis. Our findings indicate that targeting the CK1α/CBX4 axis may benefit osteosarcoma patients with metastasis."
"Research about the epidemiology of olfactory dysfunction in Asians was not enough. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and incidence rate of olfactory disorders in Koreans and to evaluate demographic risk factors. We analyzed clinical data of patients with anosmia using Korean National Health Insurance Service data from 2006 to 2016. The data includes medical insurance claim data and medical records of almost 50,000,000 people in Korea. The 30-39 age group showed the highest prevalence (19.25 per 10,000 per year). Their incidence rate was also high comparing other age groups (13.30 per 10,000 per year). The prevalence and the incidence increased from 7.10 to 13.74 and from 5.66 to 9.54 between 2006 and 2016. In the seasonal analysis, the incidence rate was high in spring and autumn. The high-income population showed about 1.4-folds higher incidence rate than the low-income population. We thought that the socioeconomic status could generally affect the rate of hospital visit in the anosmia population. Anosmia can be frequently underdiagnosed in the clinical environment because the elderly and the low-income people easily underestimate their anosmia symptom and ignore the severity due to their economic problem. Therefore careful attention and further studies for anosmia are needed."
"BackgroundThis nationwide study investigated associations between paternal occupational exposure and childhood bone tumours and soft- tissue sarcomas.MethodsThe UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours provided cases of childhood sarcomas born and diagnosed in Great Britain, 1962–2010. Control births, unaffected by childhood cancer, were matched on sex, birth period and birth registration sub-district. Fathers’ occupations were assigned to one or more of 33 exposure groups and coded for occupational social class.ResultsWe analysed 5,369 childhood sarcoma cases and 5380 controls. Total bone tumours, total soft-tissue sarcomas and the subgroups osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumours (ESFT) were considered separately. Significant positive associations were seen between rhabdomyosarcoma and paternal exposure to EMFs (odds ratio = 1.67, CI = 1.22–2.28) and also for ESFT and textile dust (1.93, 1.01–3.63). There were putative protective effects on total bone tumours of paternal dermal exposure to hydrocarbons, metal, metal working or oil mists.ConclusionsDespite the large size and freedom from bias of this study, our results should be interpreted with caution. Many significance tests were undertaken, and chance findings are to be expected. Nevertheless, our finding of associations between ESFT and paternal exposure to textile dust may support related suggestions in the literature."
"ObjectiveTo examine the effects of 30% oral dextrose on biochemical markers of pain, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation, and oxidative stress in preterm neonates experiencing a clinically required heel lance.Study designUtilizing a prospective study design, preterm neonates that met study criteria (n = 169) were randomized to receive either (1) 30% oral dextrose, (2) facilitated tucking, or (3) 30% oral dextrose and facilitated tucking 2 min before heel lance. Plasma markers of ATP degradation (hypoxanthine, uric acid) and oxidative stress (allantoin) were measured before and after the heel lance. Pain was measured using the premature infant pain profile-revised (PIPP-R).ResultsOral dextrose, administered alone or with facilitated tucking, did not alter plasma markers of ATP utilization and oxidative stress.ConclusionA single dose of 30% oral dextrose, given before a clinically required heel lance, decreased signs of pain without increasing ATP utilization and oxidative stress in premature neonates."
"Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY) is the most frequently detected somatic copy number alteration in leukocytes of men. In this study, we investigate blood cell counts as a potential mechanism linking mLOY to disease risk in 206,353 UK males. Associations between mLOY, detected by genotyping arrays, and blood cell counts were assessed by multivariable linear models adjusted for relevant risk factors. Among the participants, mLOY was detected in 39,809 men. We observed associations between mLOY and reduced erythrocyte count (−0.009 [−0.014, −0.005] × 1012 cells/L, p = 2.75 × 10−5) and elevated thrombocyte count (5.523 [4.862, 6.183] × 109 cells/L, p = 2.32 × 10−60) and leukocyte count (0.218 [0.198, 0.239] × 109 cells/L, p = 9.22 × 10−95), particularly for neutrophil count (0.174 × [0.158, 0.190]109 cells/L, p = 1.24 × 10−99) and monocyte count (0.021 [0.018 to 0.024] × 109 cells/L, p = 6.93 × 10−57), but lymphocyte count was less consistent (0.016 [0.007, 0.025] × 109 cells/L, p = 8.52 × 10−4). Stratified analyses indicate these associations are independent of the effects of aging and smoking. Our findings provide population-based evidence for associations between mLOY and blood cell counts that should stimulate investigation of the underlying biological mechanisms linking mLOY to cancer and chronic disease risk."
"Variants in the EYA4 gene are known to lead to autosomal dominant non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNA10. To date, 30 variants have been shown to be responsible for hearing loss in a diverse set of nationalities. To better understand the clinical characteristics and prevalence of DFNA10, we performed genetic screening for EYA4 mutations in a large cohort of Japanese hearing loss patients. We selected 1,336 autosomal dominant hearing loss patients among 7,408 unrelated Japanese hearing loss probands and performed targeted genome enrichment and massively parallel sequencing of 68 target genes for all patients. Clinical information of cases with mutations in EYA4 was gathered and analyzed from medical charts. Eleven novel EYA4 variants (three frameshift variants, three missense variants, two nonsense variants, one splicing variant, and two single-copy number losses) and two previously reported variants were found in 12 probands (0.90%) among the 1,336 autosomal dominant hearing loss families. The audiometric configuration of truncating variants tends to deteriorate for all frequencies, whereas that of non-truncating variants tends to show high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting a new correlation between genotype and phenotype in DFNA10. The rate of hearing loss progression caused by EYA4 variants was considered to be 0.63 dB/year, as found in this study and previous reports."
"Although the deregulation of lysine methyltransferase (su(var)-3–9, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax) domain-containing protein 7/9 (SET7/9) has been identified in a variety of cancers, the potential role of SET7/9 and the molecular events in which it is involved in breast cancer remain obscure. Using the online Human Protein Atlas and GEO databases, the expression of SET7/9 was analyzed. Furthermore, we investigated the underlying mechanisms using chromatin immunoprecipitation-based deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and quantitative ChIP assays. To explore the physiological role of SET7/9, functional analyses such as CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell assays were performed and a xenograft tumor model was generated with the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and ubiquitination assays were used to explore the mechanisms of SET7/9 function in breast cancer. We evaluated the expression of SET7/9 in different breast cancer cohorts and found that higher expression indicated worse survival times in these public databases. We demonstrated positive effects of SET7/9 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via the activation of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). We demonstrate that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) physically associates with SET7/9 and functions as a major negative regulator upstream of SET7/9 through a proteasome-dependent mechanism and increased ubiquitination. Taken together, our data suggest that SET7/9 has a promoting role via the regulation of RUNX2, whereas TRIM21-mediated SET7/9 degradation acts as an anti-braking system in the progression of breast cancer."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a relevant complication following thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (TAAA). Biomarkers, such as secretory leucocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), may enable a more accurate diagnosis. In this study, we tested if SLPI measured in serum is an appropriate biomarker of AKI after TAAA repair. In a prospective observational single-center study including 33 patients (51.5% women, mean age 63.0 ± 16.2 years) undergoing open and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair in 2017, SLPI was measured peri-operatively (until 72 h after surgery). After surgery, the postoperative complications AKI, as defined according to the KDIGO diagnostic criteria, sepsis, death, MACE (major cardiovascular events) and, pneumonia were assessed. In a subgroup analysis, patients with preexisting kidney disease were excluded. Of 33 patients, 51.5% (n = 17) of patients developed AKI. Twelve hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), SLPI serum levels were significantly increased in patients who developed AKI. Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant association between SLPI 12 hours after admission to ICU and AKI (P = 0.0181, OR = 1.055, 95% CI = 1.009–1.103). The sensitivity of SLPI for AKI prediction was 76.47% (95% CI = 50.1–93.2) and the specificity was 87.5% (95% CI = 61.7–98.4) with an AUC = 0.838 (95% CI = 0.7–0.976) for an optimal cut-off 70.03 ng/ml 12 hours after surgery. In patients without pre-existing impaired renal function, an improved diagnostic quality of SLPI for AKI was observed (Sensitivities of 45.45–91.67%, Specificities of 77.7–100%, AUC = 0.716–0.932). There was no association between perioperative SLPI and the incidence of sepsis, death, MACE (major cardiovascular events), pneumonia. This study suggests that SLPI might be a post-operative biomarker of AKI after TAAA repair, with a superior diagnostic accuracy for patients without preexisting impaired renal function."
"Little is known about the effects of posterior tethers on the development of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK). We evaluated the ability of posterior tethers to the proximal motion segment stiffness in long instrumented spinal instrumentation and fusion using a whole body human FE model. A series of finite element (FE) analysis of long segmental spinal fusion (SF) from the upper thoracic vertebra (T1) or lower thoracic vertebra (T9) to the sacrum with pedicle screws and rods were performed using an entire human body FE model (includes 234,910 elements), and compressive stresses (CS) on the anterior column, and tensile stresses (TS) on the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) in the upper-instrumented vertebra (UIV) and the vertebra adjacent to the UIV (UIV + 1) were evaluated with posterior tethers or without posterior tethers. The models were tested at three T1 tilts (0, 20, 40 deg.), with 20% muscle contraction. Deformable material models were assigned to all body parts. Muscle-tendon complexes were modeled by truss elements with a Hill-type muscle material model. The CS of anterior column decreased with increasing T1 slope with tethers in both models, while the CS remained relatively large in T9 model compared with T1 model (T1 UIV; 0.96 to 1.56 MPa, T9 UIV; 4.79 to 5.61 MPa). The TS of the supraspinous ligament was markedly reduced in both T1 and T9 models with posterior tethers (11–35%). High vertebral CS on UIV and UIV + 1 were seen in the T9 UIV model, and the TS on the PLC were increased in both UIV models. Posterior tethers may decrease PJK development after SF with a proximal thoracic UIV, while both posterior tethers and vertebral augmentation may be necessary to reduce PJK development with a lower thoracic UIV."
"Cancer recurrence after surgery remains an unresolved clinical problem1,2,3. Myeloid cells derived from bone marrow contribute to the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment, which is required for disseminating tumour cells to engraft distant sites4,5,6. There are currently no effective interventions that prevent the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment6,7. Here we show that, after surgical removal of primary lung, breast and oesophageal cancers, low-dose adjuvant epigenetic therapy disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment and inhibits both the formation and growth of lung metastases through its selective effect on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In mouse models of pulmonary metastases, MDSCs are key factors in the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment after resection of primary tumours. Adjuvant epigenetic therapy that uses low-dose DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and entinostat, disrupts the premetastatic niche by inhibiting the trafficking of MDSCs through the downregulation of CCR2 and CXCR2, and by promoting MDSC differentiation into a more-interstitial macrophage-like phenotype. A decreased accumulation of MDSCs in the premetastatic lung produces longer periods of disease-free survival and increased overall survival, compared with chemotherapy. Our data demonstrate that, even after removal of the primary tumour, MDSCs contribute to the development of premetastatic niches and settlement of residual tumour cells. A combination of low-dose adjuvant epigenetic modifiers that disrupts this premetastatic microenvironment and inhibits metastases may permit an adjuvant approach to cancer therapy."
"Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disease characterized by abnormal neuronal activity resulting in recurrent seizures. There is mounting evidence that a circadian system disruption, involving clock genes and their downstream transcriptional regulators, is associated with epilepsy. In this study, we characterized the hippocampal expression of clock genes and PAR bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA). The expression of PAR bZIP TFs was significantly altered following KA injection as well as in other rodent models of acquired epilepsy. Although the PAR bZIP TFs are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral tissues, we discovered that the regulation of their expression is inflammation-independent in hippocampal tissue and rather mediated by clock genes and hyperexcitability. Furthermore, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf), a member of PAR bZIP TFs family, is invariably downregulated in animal models of acquired epilepsy, regulates neuronal activity in vitro and its overexpression in dentate gyrus neurons in vivo leads to altered expression of genes associated with seizures and epilepsy. Overall, our study provides further evidence of PAR bZIP TFs involvement in epileptogenesis and points to Hlf as the key player."
"Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) is the commonest diagnosis after premature birth. We aimed to audit clinical practices before and after introduction of a national guideline in Wales on RDS management. Anonymised, prospective data on all infants born at <34 weeks of gestation and cared for at one of the participating neonatal units in Wales were collected in two six-month time periods in 2015 and 2018. A national guideline was introduced in 2016 by the Wales Neonatal Network. Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management. Further work should focus on education and training, especially for elements requiring cross-departmental work."
"Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is known to modulate immune response in peripheral blood cells. The mechanisms of THC’s effects on gene expression in human immune cells remains poorly understood. Combining a within-subject design with single cell transcriptome mapping, we report that THC acutely alters gene expression in 15,973 blood cells. We identified 294 transcriptome-wide significant genes among eight cell types including 69 common genes and 225 cell-type-specific genes affected by THC administration, including those genes involving in immune response, cytokine production, cell proliferation and apoptosis. We revealed distinct transcriptomic sub-clusters affected by THC in major immune cell types where THC perturbed cell-type-specific intracellular gene expression correlations. Gene set enrichment analysis further supports the findings of THC’s common and cell-type-specific effects on immune response and cell toxicity. This comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic profiling provides important insights into THC’s acute effects on immune function that may have important medical implications."
"Dual-energy spectral computed tomography (DESCT) is based on fast switching between high and low voltages from view to view to obtain dual-energy imaging data, and it can generate monochromatic image sets, iodine-based material decomposition images and spectral CT curves. Quantitative spectral CT parameters may be valuable for reflecting Ki-67 expression and EGFR mutation status in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the associations among the quantitative parameters generated in DESCT and Ki-67 expression and EGFR mutation in NSCLC. We studied sixty-five NSCLC patients with preoperative DESCT scans, and their specimens underwent Ki-67 and EGFR evaluations. Statistical analyses were performed to identify the spectral CT parameters for the diagnosis of Ki-67 expression and EGFR mutation status. We found that tumour grade and the slope of the spectral CT curve in the venous phase were the independent factors influencing the Ki-67 expression level, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the slope of the spectral CT curve in the venous phase in the receiver operating characteristic analysis for distinguishing different Ki-67 expression levels was 0.901. Smoking status and the normalized iodine concentration in the venous phase were independent factors influencing EGFR mutation, and the AUC of the two-factor combination for predicting the presence of EGFR mutation was 0.807. These results show that spectral CT parameters may be useful for predicting Ki-67 expression and the presence of EGFR mutation in NSCLC."
"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoactive peptide that is elevated in aqueous humor as well as circulation of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. ET-1 has been shown to promote degeneration of optic nerve axons and apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), however, the precise mechanisms are still largely unknown. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was used to assess changes in ET-1 mediated gene expression in primary RGCs, which revealed that 23 out of 156 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) had known or predicted mitochondrial function, of which oxidative phosphorylation emerged as the top-most enriched pathway. ET-1 treatment significantly decreased protein expression of key mitochondrial genes including cytochrome C oxidase copper chaperone (COX17) and ATP Synthase, H+ transporting, Mitochondrial Fo Complex (ATP5H) in primary RGCs and in vivo following intravitreal ET-1 injection in rats. A Seahorse ATP rate assay revealed a significant decrease in the rate of mitochondrial ATP production following ET-1 treatment. IOP elevation in Brown Norway rats showed a trend towards decreased expression of ATP5H. Our results demonstrate that ET-1 produced a decrease in expression of vital components of mitochondrial electron transport chain, which compromise bioenergetics and suggest a mechanism by which ET-1 promotes neurodegeneration of RGCs in glaucoma."
"As malaria control programmes concentrate their efforts towards malaria elimination a better understanding of malaria transmission patterns at fine spatial resolution units becomes necessary. Defining spatial units that consider transmission heterogeneity, human movement and migration will help to set up achievable malaria elimination milestones and guide the creation of efficient operational administrative control units. Using a combination of genetic and epidemiological data we defined a malaria transmission unit as the area contributing 95% of malaria cases diagnosed at the catchment facility located in the town of Guapi in the South Pacific Coast of Colombia. We provide data showing that P. falciparum malaria transmission is heterogeneous in time and space and analysed, using topological data analysis, the spatial connectivity, at the micro epidemiological level, between parasite populations circulating within the unit. To illustrate the necessity to evaluate the efficacy of malaria control measures within the transmission unit in order to increase the efficiency of the malaria control effort, we provide information on the size of the asymptomatic reservoir, the nature of parasite genotypes associated with drug resistance as well as the frequency of the Pfhrp2/3 deletion associated with false negatives when using Rapid Diagnostic Tests."
"In the present study, we report the effects of extracellular medium conductivity on cell response in the context of sub-microsecond range (100 ns–900 ns) electroporation, calcium electroporation and cell size. The effects of 25 ns and microsecond range (100 μs) pulses were also covered. As a model, three different cancer cell lines of various size (C32, MCF-7/DX and MC38/0) were used and the results indicated different size-dependent susceptibility patterns to the treatment. The applied pulsed electric field (PEF) protocols revealed a significant decrease of cell viability when calcium electroporation was used. The dependence of calcium ion transport and finally the anticancer effect on the external medium conductivity was determined. It was shown that small differences in conductivity do not alter viability significantly, however, mostly affect the permeabilization. At the same, MC38/0 cell line was the least susceptible to calcium electroporation, while the C32 line the most. In all cases calcium electroporation was mostly dependent on the sensitivity of cells to electroporation and could not be effectively improved by the increase of CaCl2 concentration from 2 mM to 5 mM. Lastly, sub-microsecond PEF stimulated aquaporin-4 and VDAC1/Porin immunoreactions in all treated cells lines, which indicated that cell water balance is affected, ions exchange is increased and release of mitochondrial products is occurrent."
"Investigating COPD trends may help healthcare providers to forecast future disease burden. We estimated sex- and smoking-specific incidence trends of pre-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (AO) among adults without asthma from 11 European countries within a 20-year follow-up (ECRHS and SAPALDIA cohorts). We also quantified the extent of misclassification in the definition based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry (using post-bronchodilator measurements from a subsample of subjects) and we used this information to estimate the incidence of post-bronchodilator AO (AOpost-BD), which is the primary characteristic of COPD. AO incidence was 4.4 (95% CI: 3.5–5.3) male and 3.8 (3.1–4.6) female cases/1,000/year. Among ever smokers (median pack-years: 20, males; 12, females), AO incidence significantly increased with ageing in men only [incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1-year increase: 1.05 (1.03–1.07)]. A strong exposure-response relationship with smoking was found both in males [IRR, 1-pack-year increase: 1.03 (1.02–1.04)] and females [1.03 (1.02–1.05)]. The positive predictive value of AO for AOpost-BD was 59.1% (52.0–66.2%) in men and 42.6% (35.1–50.1%) in women. AOpost-BD incidence was 2.6 (1.7–3.4) male and 1.6 (1.0–2.2) female cases/1,000/year. AO incidence was considerable in Europe and the sex-specific ageing-related increase among ever smokers was strongly related to cumulative tobacco exposure. AOpost-BD incidence is expected to be half of AO incidence."
"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the heritability of inner retinal layer (IRL) and outer retinal layer (ORL) thicknesses in the healthy Korean population. This was a cross-sectional, twin and family study. We included 374 Korean adults with healthy eyes from 89 families. IRL thickness (from the internal limiting membrane to the external limiting membrane) and ORL thickness (from the external limiting membrane to the outer border of the retinal pigment epithelium layer) were measured in the nine macular subfields as defined by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study using optical coherence tomography. The heritability on IRL and ORL thicknesses were investigated using a variance decomposition model. The heritability of IRL thickness was 0.87, 0.58, 0.85, 0.89, and 0.74 for the central, inner superior, inner inferior, inner temporal, inner nasal subfields, respectively; and 0.62, 0.83, 0.62, and 0.60 for the outer superior, outer inferior, outer temporal, outer nasal subfields, respectively. The heritability of ORL thickness was 0.56, 0.75, 0.66, 0.72, and 0.56 for the central, inner superior, inner inferior, inner temporal, inner nasal subfields, respectively; and 0.64, 0.63, 0.73, 0.54 for the outer superior, outer inferior, outer temporal, and outer nasal subfields, respectively. The heritability estimates of IRL thickness and ORL thickness ranged from moderate to high. The IRL thickness at the central, inner temporal, and inner inferior subfields had particularly high heritability."
"EGFR and KRAS are the most frequently mutated genes in lung cancer, being active research topics in targeted therapy. The biopsy is the traditional method to genetically characterise a tumour. However, it is a risky procedure, painful for the patient, and, occasionally, the tumour might be inaccessible. This work aims to study and debate the nature of the relationships between imaging phenotypes and lung cancer-related mutation status. Until now, the literature has failed to point to new research directions, mainly consisting of results-oriented works in a field where there is still not enough available data to train clinically viable models. We intend to open a discussion about critical points and to present new possibilities for future radiogenomics studies. We conducted high-dimensional data visualisation and developed classifiers, which allowed us to analyse the results for EGFR and KRAS biological markers according to different combinations of input features. We show that EGFR mutation status might be correlated to CT scans imaging phenotypes; however, the same does not seem to hold for KRAS mutation status. Also, the experiments suggest that the best way to approach this problem is by combining nodule-related features with features from other lung structures."
"We aimed to develop a hypertension risk-prediction model among rural Chinese people. We included data for 9034 participants aged 18–70 years without baseline hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure in a rural Chinese cohort. The sample was randomly divided into a training set (60%) and testing set (40%). We used shrinkage estimates by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method in fitting a logistic model to explore the possibility of predicting the risk of hypertension in the training set. On multivariable analysis, age, parental hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and age by BMI were significant predictors of hypertension. After bootstrap validation, the corrected C-index, calibration intercept, and calibration slope were 0.7932, −0.0041, and 0.9938, respectively for the training set. Our model also had good discrimination (C-index, 0.7914 [95% CI 0.773–0.809]) and calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow χ2 = 14.366, P = 0.073) for the testing set. Nomograms and score-based models were used to favor the clinical implementation and workability of the risk model. According to the risk score based on these factors, the cumulative risk for hypertension was <20% for 57.62% of participants, 20–40% risk for 27.24%, 40–60% for 12.19%, and >60% for 2.96% during the 6-year follow-up. The score-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the present model and the Framingham risk-score model were similar (P = 0.282). The hypertension risk-prediction system we developed provides convenient approaches to identify individuals at high risk of hypertension."
"Maize, a major food source for the world, is a high-yield commodity crop, and one of five major crops in Thailand. Occupying about 33% of the Thai upland farmlands, maize farming has been growing tremendously especially in northern Thailand. However, after harvesting, open burning is widely used in order to get rid of maize cobs and husks in land preparation for the next period. The current maize farming practices have caused several problems to local communities as well as urban dwellers. The objectives of this research were: (i) to analyze the life cycle inventory of maize cultivation, maize cob pellet production and heavy fuel oil production in northern Thailand using IDEA v2.0 and ecoinvent v3.0 databases; (ii) to evaluate environmental impacts of maize cultivation, maize cob pellet production and heavy fuel oil production using A Global Scale Environmental Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LIME-3) with the results of weighting (Country-specific) based on monetary valuation of end-points. This study evaluated the life cycle environmental impacts of maize cultivation and continuing through biomass energy production from maize cob by comparing with heat production from heavy fuel oil in Mae Chaem and Chiang Dao districts in the north of Thailand by using two different databases, IDEA v2.0 and ecoinvent v3.0 with an endpoint-based life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method (LIME-3). The system boundary of this study includes land preparation, planting, weeding, farming, harvesting, maize cob pellet production and heat production from maize cob pellet and heavy fuel oil. The units of analysis in this study are 1 kg of maize grain, 3.76E-03 MJ of biomass energy production from maize cob and 3.76E-03 MJ of heat production from heavy fuel oil, respectively. The data were obtained from field survey supplemented with the Thai National Life Cycle Inventory Database and other scientific publications. The results included the environmental impacts of maize cultivation and continuing through biomass energy production from maize cob by comparing with heat production from heavy fuel oil in Mae Chaem and Chiang Dao districts by using two different databases with LCIA method on the endpoint approaches (LIME-3). The total damage cost based on IDEA v2.0 life cycle inventory (LCI) database in Mae Chaem and Chiang Dao districts was about 4.64E-01 USD and 4.89E-01 USD, respectively. As regards ecoinvent v3.0 database, the total damage cost in Mae Chaem and Chiang Dao districts was about 5.37E-01USD and 5.99E-01 USD, respectively. It can be seen that the total damage cost using different inventory databases in Chiang Dao are slightly higher than Mae Chaem due to different input materials. The result of total cost using inventory data from ecoinvent v3.0 is slightly higher than IDEA v2.0 due to different inventory processes in each database. However, the results in this study demonstrated that the databases show similar trends in the assessment results. On the other hand, certain numerical differences between the databases at some points were found to be more substantial. The results of present study are particularly relevant to policy choices for improving or using the good practices for maize cultivation, which would reduce the environmental performance of maize production systems in the area. To address the air pollution issue from biomass open burning of agricultural residues in the study area, the government agencies in Thailand should be responsible for promoting better biomass management for the future."
"PurposeAfrican Americans experience greater prostate cancer risk and mortality than do Caucasians. An analysis of pooled phase III data suggested differences in overall survival (OS) between African American and Caucasian men receiving sipuleucel-T. We explored this in PROCEED (NCT01306890), an FDA-requested registry in over 1900 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with sipuleucel-T.Patients and methodsOS for patients who received ≥1 sipuleucel-T infusion was compared between African American and Caucasian men using an all patient set and a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-matched set (two Caucasians to every one African American with baseline PSAs within 10% of each other). Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Survival data were examined using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazard methodologies.ResultsMedian follow-up was 46.6 months. Overall survival differed between African American and Caucasian men with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68–0.97, P = 0.03) in the all patient set and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57–0.86, P < 0.001) in the PSA-matched set. Median OS was longer in African Americans than in Caucasian men for both analysis sets, e.g., 35.3 and 25.8 months, respectively, in the PSA-matched set. Similar results were observed in the all patient set. Differences were larger when treatment began at lower baseline PSA; curves were more similar among patients with higher baseline PSA. In patients with baseline PSA below the median, the HR was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37–0.72, P < 0.001), with median OS of 54.3 versus 33.4 months. Known prognostic factors and African American race (multivariable analyses; HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48–0.74, P < 0.001) were independently associated with OS. Use of post-sipuleucel-T anticancer interventions was balanced between races.ConclusionIn this exploratory analysis of a registry including nearly 12% African American men with mCRPC, OS was significantly different between African Americans and Caucasians, indicating further research is warranted."
"The allograft inflammatory factor (AIF) gene family consists of two identified paralogs – AIF1 and AIF1-like (AIF1L). The encoded proteins, AIF1 and AIF1L, are 80% similar in sequence and show conserved tertiary structure. While studies in human populations suggest links between AIF1 and metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, such associations with AIF1L have not been reported. Drawing parallels based on structural similarity, we postulated that AIF1L might contribute to metabolic disorders, and studied it using mouse models. Here we report that AIF1L is expressed in major adipose depots and kidney but was not detectable in liver or skeletal muscle; in notable contrast to AIF1, AIF1L was also not found in spleen. Studies of AIF1L deficient mice showed no obvious postnatal developmental phenotype. In response to high fat diet (HFD) feeding for 6 or 18 weeks, WT and AIF1L deficient mice gained weight similarly, showed no differences in fat or lean mass accumulation, and displayed no changes in energy expenditure or systemic glucose handling. These findings indicate that AIF1L is not essential for the development of obesity or impaired glucose handling due to HFD, and advance understanding of this little-studied gene and its place in the AIF gene family."
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection causes high rates of morbidity and mortality. Host-directed therapy may enhance the immune response, reduce tissue damage and shorten treatment duration. The inflammasome is integral to innate immune responses but over-activation has been described in tuberculosis (TB) pathology and TB-immune reconstitution syndrome. Here we explore how clinical isolates differentially activate the inflammasome and how inflammasome inhibition can lead to enhanced bacterial clearance. Wild-type, Nlrp3−/−/Aim2−/−, Casp1/11−/− and Asc−/− murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with laboratory strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv or clinical isolates from various lineages. Inflammasome activation and bacterial numbers were measured, and pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 was achieved using MCC950. Clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis differed in their ability to activate inflammasomes. Beijing isolates had contrasting effects on IL-1β and caspase-1 activation, but all clinical isolates induced lower IL-1β release than H37Rv. Our studies suggest the involvement of NLRP3, AIM2 and an additional unknown sensor in IL-1β maturation. Pharmacological blockade of NLRP3 with MCC950 reduced bacterial survival, and combined treatment with the antimycobacterial drug rifampicin enhanced the effect. Modulating the inflammasome is an attractive adjunct to current anti-mycobacterial therapy that warrants further investigation."
"The presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is associated with favourable outcomes in patients with breast cancer as well as in those with other solid tumours. T cells make up a considerable proportion of TILs and current evidence suggests that CD8+ T cells are a crucial determinant of favourable clinical outcomes. Studies involving tumour material from numerous solid tumour types, including breast cancer, demonstrate that the CD8+ TILs include a subpopulation of tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. This subpopulation has features consistent with those of TRM cells, which have been described as having a role in peripheral immune surveillance and viral immunity in both humans and mice. Patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancers harbouring greater numbers of TRM cells have a substantially improved prognosis and longer overall survival. Furthermore, patients with advanced-stage breast cancers with higher levels of TRM cells have increased response rates to anti-PD-1 antibodies. These findings have motivated efforts to explore whether CD8+ TRM cells include tumour-specific T cells, their functional responses to cognate antigens and their role in responses to immune checkpoint inhibition. In this Review, we focus on the clinical significance of CD8+ TRM cells and the potential ways that these cells can be targeted to improve the success of immunotherapeutic approaches in patients with breast cancer, as well as in those with other solid tumour types."
"Methods for phenotype and outcome prediction are largely based on inductive supervised models that use selected biomarkers to make predictions, without explicitly considering the functional relationships between individuals. We introduce a novel network-based approach named Patient-Net (P-Net) in which biomolecular profiles of patients are modeled in a graph-structured space that represents gene expression relationships between patients. Then a kernel-based semi-supervised transductive algorithm is applied to the graph to explore the overall topology of the graph and to predict the phenotype/clinical outcome of patients. Experimental tests involving several publicly available datasets of patients afflicted with pancreatic, breast, colon and colorectal cancer show that our proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised predictive systems. Importantly, P-Net also provides interpretable models that can be easily visualized to gain clues about the relationships between patients, and to formulate hypotheses about their stratification."
"Cancer stem cells (CSC) can be identified by modifications in their genomic DNA. Here, we report a concept of precisely shrinking an organic semiconductor surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe to quantum size, for investigating the epigenetic profile of CSC. The probe is used for tag-free genomic DNA detection, an approach towards the advancement of single-molecule DNA detection. The sensor detected structural, molecular and gene expression aberrations of genomic DNA in femtomolar concentration simultaneously in a single test. In addition to pointing out the divergences in genomic DNA of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, the quantum scale organic semiconductor was able to trace the expression of two genes which are frequently used as CSC markers. The quantum scale organic semiconductor holds the potential to be a new tool for label-free, ultra-sensitive multiplexed genomic analysis."
"BackgroundHigh-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most frequent type of ovarian carcinoma, associated with poor clinical outcome and metastatic disease. Although metastatic processes are becoming more understandable, the genomic landscape and metastatic progression in HGSOC has not been elucidated.MethodsMulti-region whole-exome sequencing was performed on HGSOC primary tumours and their metastases (n = 33 tumour regions) from six patients. The resulting somatic variants were analysed to delineate tumour evolution and metastatic dissemination, and to compare the repertoire of events between primary HGSOC and metastasis.ResultsAll cases presented branching evolution patterns in primary HGSOC, with three cases further showing parallel evolution in which different mutations on separate branches of a phylogenetic tree converge on the same gene. Furthermore, linear metastatic progression was observed in 67% of cases with late dissemination, in which the metastatic tumour mostly acquires the same mutational process active in primary tumour, and parallel metastatic progression, with early dissemination in the remaining 33.3% of cases. Metastatic-specific SNVs were further confirmed as late dissemination events. We also found the involvement of metastatic-specific driver events in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and identified potential clinically actionable events in individual patients of the metastatic HGSOC cohort.ConclusionsThis study provides deeper insights into clonal evolution and mutational processes that can pave the way to new therapeutic targets."
"A major characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Several studies linked AD with type 2 diabetes due to similarities between Aβ and human amylin. This study investigates the effect of amylin and pramlintide on Aβ pathogenesis and the predisposing molecular mechanism(s) behind the observed effects in TgSwDI mouse, a cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and AD model. Our findings showed that thirty days of intraperitoneal injection with amylin or pramlintide increased Aβ burden in mice brains. Mechanistic studies revealed both peptides altered the amyloidogenic pathway and increased Aβ production by modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) and γ-secretase levels in lipid rafts. In addition, both peptides increased levels of B4GALNT1 enzyme and GM1 ganglioside, and only pramlintide increased the level of GM2 ganglioside. Increased levels of GM1 and GM2 gangliosides play an important role in regulating amyloidogenic pathway proteins in lipid rafts. Increased brain Aβ burden by amylin and pramlintide was associated with synaptic loss, apoptosis, and microglia activation. In conclusion, our findings showed amylin or pramlintide increase Aβ levels and related pathology in TgSwDI mice brains, and suggest that increased amylin levels or the therapeutic use of pramlintide could increase the risk of AD."
"Comorbidities impair the prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) increases the risk of other comorbidities, e.g., heart failure (HF). Thus, we hypothesized that pre-existing DMT2 may negatively affect the outcome of DLBCL. To verify this, DLBCL patients treated with (R)-CHOP were enrolled. 469 patients were eligible, with a median age of 57 years; 356 patients had advanced-stage DLBCL. 126 patients had high-intermediate and 83 high-risk international prognostic index (IPI). Seventy-six patients had DMT2, 46 HF; 26 patients suffered from both DMT2 and HF. In the analyzed group DMT2 or HF significantly shortened overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS): the 5-year OS for patients with DMT2 was 64% vs 79% and for those with HF: 49% vs 79%. The 5-year PFS for DMT2 was 50.6% vs 62.5% and for HF 39.4% vs 63.2%. The relapse/progression incidence was comparable between groups; the non-relapse/progression mortality (NRPM) was significantly higher solely in DMT2 patients (5-year NRPM 22.5% vs 8.4%). The risk of death was higher in patients with higher IPI (HR = 1.85) and with DMT2 (HR = 1.87). To conclude, pre-existing DMT2, in addition to a higher IPI and HF, was a negative predictor for OS and PFS."
"WW domain binding protein 5 (WBP5), also known as Transcriptional Elongation Factor A like 9 (TCEAL9) has been proposed as a candidate oncogene for human colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability and as a predictive indicator of small cell lung cancers. Furthermore, several independent studies have proposed WBP5, and its association with Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) expression, as part of a gene expression-based risk score for predicting survival and clinical outcome in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). To date, the prognostic significance of the sole WBP5 expression and its impact on the survival outcome in AML patients remains largely understudied. In the present study, we have made use of publicly available patient expression arrays and have developed an unbiased approach to classify AML patients into low versus high WBP5 expressers and to balance them for known mutations and cytogenetic findings. Interestingly, we found that patients characterized by high WBP5 expression displayed inferior overall and event-free survival rates. Notably, gene expression profiling showed that patients with high WBP5 had elevated expression of several HOX cluster genes, such as HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA9 and HOXA10, and several of their partner proteins, such as MEIS1 and FOXC1, which have been demonstrated to be causative for AML. Taken together, our data suggest that WBP5 expression level could serve as an indicator for prognosis and survival outcome in patients with AML."
"Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration."
"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebro-occlusive disease with unknown etiology that can cause both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. MMD is characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal internal carotid artery (ICA) and development of basal brain collaterals. Early-stage MMD is known to cause hemodynamic insufficiency despite mild or moderate stenosis of the intracranial arteries, but the exact mechanism underlying this pathophysiological condition is undetermined. We used high-resolution Large Eddy Simulations to investigate multiple complex hemodynamic phenomena that led to cerebral ischemia in five patients with early-stage MMD. The effects of transitional flow, coherent flow structures and blood shear-thinning properties through regions of tortuous and stenosed arteries were explored and linked to symptomatology. It is evidently shown that in some cases complex vortex structures, such as Rankine-type vortices, redirects blood flow away from some arteries causing significant reduction in blood flow. Moreover, partial blood hammer (PBH) phenomenon was detected in some cases and led to significant hemodynamic insufficiency. PBH events were attributed to the interaction between shear-thinning properties, transitional flow structures and loss of upstream pressure-velocity phase lag. We clearly show that the hemodynamic complexities in early-stage MMD could induce ischemia and explain the non-responsiveness to antiplatelet therapy."
"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation, associated with 1–3% of Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here, we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS, decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S."
"Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway by mutations within its components drives the growth of several cancers. However, the role of Hh pathway activation in lung cancers has been controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical Hh signaling pathway is activated in lung stroma by Hh ligands secreted from transformed lung epithelia. Genetic deletion of Shh, the primary Hh ligand expressed in the lung, in KrasG12D/+;Trp53fl/fl autochthonous murine lung adenocarcinoma had no effect on survival. Early abrogation of the pathway by an anti-SHH/IHH antibody 5E1 led to significantly worse survival with increased tumor and metastatic burden. Loss of IHH, another Hh ligand, by in vivo CRISPR led to more aggressive tumor growth suggesting that IHH, rather than SHH, activates the pathway in stroma to drive its tumor suppressive effects—a novel role for IHH in the lung. Tumors from mice treated with 5E1 had decreased blood vessel density and increased DNA damage suggestive of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. Treatment of KrasG12D/+;Trp53fl/fl mice with 5E1 and N-acetylcysteine, as a ROS scavenger, decreased tumor DNA damage, inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. Thus, IHH induces stromal activation of the canonical Hh signaling pathway to suppress tumor growth and metastases, in part, by limiting ROS activity."
"The aims of the study were to identify subclinical global systolic function abnormalities and evaluate influencing factors associated with left ventricular (LV) strain parameters in hypertensive subjects using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging feature tracking (CMR-FT). The study enrolled 57 patients with essential hypertension (mean age: 43.04 ± 10.90 years; 35 males) and 26 healthy volunteers (mean age: 38.69 ± 10.44 years; 11 males) who underwent clinical evaluation and CMR examination. Compared with controls, hypertensive patients had significantly impaired myocardial strain values while ejection fraction (EF) did not differ. After multivariate regression analyses adjustment for confounders, the global radial strains (GRS) was independently associated with the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (β = −0.219, p = 0.009 and β = −0.224, p = 0.015, respectively; Adjusted R2 = 0.4); the global circumferential strains (GCS) was also independently associated with the MAP and LVMI (β = 0.084, p = 0.002 and β = 0.073, p = 0.01, respectively; Adjusted R2 = 0.439); the global longitudinal strains (GLS) was independently associated with the Age and MAP (β = 0.065, p = 0.021 and β = 0.077, p = 0.009, respectively; Adjusted R2 = 0.289). Myocardial strain can early detect the myocardial damage and may be an appropriate target for preventive strategies before abnormalities of EF."
"Anabolic metabolism mediated by aberrant growth factor signalling fuels tumour growth and progression. The first biochemical descriptions of the altered metabolic nature of solid tumours were reported by Otto Warburg almost a century ago. Now, the study of tumour metabolism is being redefined by the development of new molecular tools, tumour modelling systems and precise instrumentation together with important advances in genetics, cell biology and spectroscopy. In contrast to Warburg’s original hypothesis, accumulating evidence demonstrates a critical role for mitochondrial metabolism and substantial variation in the way in which different tumours metabolize nutrients to generate biomass. Furthermore, computational and experimental approaches suggest a dominant influence of the tissue-of-origin in shaping the metabolic reprogramming that enables tumour growth. For example, the unique metabolic properties of prostate adenocarcinoma are likely to stem from the distinct metabolism of the prostatic epithelium from which it emerges. Normal prostatic epithelium employs comparatively glycolytic metabolism to sustain physiological citrate secretion, whereas prostate adenocarcinoma consumes citrate to power oxidative phosphorylation and fuel lipogenesis, enabling tumour progression through metabolic reprogramming. Current data suggest that the distinct metabolic aberrations in prostate adenocarcinoma are driven by the androgen receptor, providing opportunities for functional metabolic imaging and novel therapeutic interventions that will be complementary to existing diagnostic and treatment options."
"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus of clinical significance in both livestock and humans. A formalin-inactivated virus preparation was initially developed for human use and tested in laboratory workers in the 1960s. Vaccination resulted in generation of neutralizing antibody titers in most recipients, but neutralization titers waned over time, necessitating frequent booster doses. In this study, T cell-based immune responses to the formalin-inactivated vaccine were examined in a cohort of seven individuals who received between 1 and 6 doses of the vaccine. RVFV-specific T cell responses were detectable up to 24 years post vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from this cohort of individuals were used to map out the viral epitopes targeted by T cells in humans. These data provide tools for assessing human RVFV-specific T cell responses and are thus a valuable resource for future human RVFV vaccine efforts."
"Complex abdominal wall defects (CAWDs) can be difficult to repair and using a conventional synthetic mesh is often unsuitable. A biological mesh might offer a solution for CAWD repair, but the clinical outcomes are unclear. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a cross-linked, acellular porcine dermal collagen matrix implant (Permacol) for CAWD repair in a cohort of 60 patients. Here, 58.3% patients presented with a grade 3 hernia (according to the Ventral Hernia Working Group grading system) and a contaminated surgical field. Permacol was implanted as a bridge in 46.7%, as an underlay (intraperitoneal position) in 38.3% and as a sublay (retromuscolar position) in 15% of patients. Fascia closure was achieved in 53.3% of patients. The surgical site occurrence rate was 35% and the defect size significantly influenced the probability of post-operative complications. The long-term (2 year) hernia recurrence rate was 36.2%. This study represents the first large multi-centre Italian case series on Permacol implants in patients with a CAWD. Our data suggest that Permacol is a feasible strategy to repair a CAWD, with acceptable early complications and long-term (2 year) recurrence rates."
"In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the clinical significance of soluble immune checkpoint protein levels as predictors of patient outcomes or therapeutic responses has yet to be defined. This study profiled the baseline levels of sixteen soluble checkpoint proteins and their changes following sorafenib treatment for HCC. Plasma samples were obtained from 53 patients with advanced HCC at baseline, week 1, 2 and 4 of sorafenib treatment and tested the concentrations of 16 soluble checkpoint proteins using multiplexed fluorescent bead-based immunoassays. Multivariate analysis showed high sBTLA levels at baseline were an independent predictor of poor overall survival (p = 0.038). BTLA was highly expressed in T cells and macrophages in peritumoral areas. At week 2, sCD27 levels were decreased compared to baseline. By contrast, the concentrations of most inhibitory proteins, including sBTLA, sLAG-3, sCTLA-4, sPD-1, sCD80, sCD86 and sPD-L1, had significantly increased. The fold-changes of soluble checkpoint receptors and their ligands, including sCTLA-4 with sCD80/sCD86, sPD-1 with sPD-L1; and the fold-changes of sCTLA-4 with sBTLA or sPD-1 were positively correlated. sBTLA may be a good biomarker for predicting overall survival in HCC patients. Sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC revealed dynamic changes of soluble checkpoint protein levels."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains one of the biggest challenges in the development of neuroregenerative therapeutics. Cell transplantation is one of numerous experimental strategies that have been identified and tested for efficacy at both preclinical and clinical levels in recent years. In this Review, we briefly discuss the state of human olfactory cell transplantation as a therapy, considering both its current clinical status and its limitations. Furthermore, we introduce a mesenchymal stromal cell derived from human olfactory tissue, which has the potential to induce multifaceted reparative effects in the environment within and surrounding the lesion. We argue that no single therapy will be sufficient to treat SCI effectively and that a combination of cell-based, rehabilitation and pharmaceutical interventions is the most promising approach to aid repair. For this reason, we also introduce a novel pharmaceutical strategy based on modifying the activity of heparan sulfate, an important regulator of a wide range of biological cell functions. The multi-target approach that is exemplified by these types of strategies will probably be necessary to optimize SCI treatment."
"Cardiac imaging has a pivotal role in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ischaemic heart disease. SPECT is most commonly used for clinical myocardial perfusion imaging, whereas PET is the clinical reference standard for the quantification of myocardial perfusion. MRI does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation, similar to echocardiography, which can be performed at the bedside. CT perfusion imaging is not frequently used but CT offers coronary angiography data, and invasive catheter-based methods can measure coronary flow and pressure. Technical improvements to the quantification of pathophysiological parameters of myocardial ischaemia can be achieved. Clinical consensus recommendations on the appropriateness of each technique were derived following a European quantitative cardiac imaging meeting and using a real-time Delphi process. SPECT using new detectors allows the quantification of myocardial blood flow and is now also suited to patients with a high BMI. PET is well suited to patients with multivessel disease to confirm or exclude balanced ischaemia. MRI allows the evaluation of patients with complex disease who would benefit from imaging of function and fibrosis in addition to perfusion. Echocardiography remains the preferred technique for assessing ischaemia in bedside situations, whereas CT has the greatest value for combined quantification of stenosis and characterization of atherosclerosis in relation to myocardial ischaemia. In patients with a high probability of needing invasive treatment, invasive coronary flow and pressure measurement is well suited to guide treatment decisions. In this Consensus Statement, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses as well as the future technological potential of each imaging modality."
"In all commercial cochlear implant (CI) devices, the electric stimulation is performed with a rectangular pulse that generally has two phases of opposite polarity. To date, developing new stimulation strategies has relied on the efficacy of this shape. Here, we investigate the potential of a novel stimulation paradigm that uses biophysically-inspired electrical ramped pulses. Using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem response (eABR) recordings in mice, we found that less charge, but higher current level amplitude, is needed to evoke responses with ramped shapes that are similar in amplitude to responses obtained with rectangular shapes. The most charge-efficient pulse shape had a rising ramp over both phases, supporting findings from previous in vitro studies. This was also true for longer phase durations. Our study presents the first physiological data on CI-stimulation with ramped pulse shapes. By reducing charge consumption ramped pulses have the potential to produce more battery-efficient CIs and may open new perspectives for designing other efficient neural implants in the future."
"Prevalence of functional somatic syndromes (FSS) in the general population varies with observed overlap between syndromes. However, studies including a range of FSS are sparse. We investigated prevalence and characteristics of various FSS and the unifying diagnostic construct bodily distress syndrome (BDS), and identified mutual overlap of the FSS and their overlap with BDS. We included a stratified subsample of 1590 adults from a randomly selected Danish general population sample (n = 7493). Telephonic diagnostic interviews performed by three trained physicians were used to identify individuals with FSS and BDS. Prevalence of overall FSS was 9.3%; 3.8% for irritable bowel, 2.2% for chronic widespread pain, 6.1% for chronic fatigue, 1.5% for whiplash associated disorders, and 0.9% for multiple chemical sensitivity. Prevalence of BDS was 10.7% where 2.0% had the multi-organ type. FSS were highly overlapping with low likelihood of having a “pure” type. Diagnostic agreement of FSS and BDS was 92.0%. Multi-syndromatic FSS and multi-organ BDS were associated with female sex, poor health, physical limitations, and comorbidity. FSS are highly prevalent and overlapping, and multi-syndromatic cases are most affected. BDS captured the majority of FSS and may improve clinical management, making the distinction between multi- and mono-syndromatic patients easier."
"Depression is still one of challenging, and widely encountered disorders with complex etiology. The role of healthy diet and olive oil in ameliorating depression has been claimed. This study was designed to explore the effects of oleuropein; the main constituent of olive oil; on depression-like behaviors that are induced by repeated administration of corticosterone (40 mg/kg, i.p.), once a day for 21 days, in mice. Oleuropein (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, positive control, i.p.1) was administered 30 minutes prior to corticosterone injection. Sucrose consumption test, open-field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were performed. Reduced Glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation, and biogenic amines; serotonin, dopamine, and nor-epinephrine; levels were also analyzed in brain homogenates. Corticosterone treatment induced depression-like behaviors, it increased immobility time in the TST, OFT, and FST, decreased the number of movements in OFT, and decreased sucrose consumption. Corticosterone effect was associated with depletion of reduced glutathione and increase of lipid peroxidation, in addition to modification of biogenic amines; decreased serotonin and dopamine. Oleuropein or fluoxetine administration counteracted corticosterone-induced changes. In conclusion, oleuropein showed a promising antidepressant activity, that is evident by improving corticosterone-induced depression-like behaviors, and normalizing levels of biogenic amines."
"Malignant melanoma is considered to be a heterogeneous disease that arises from altered genes and transformed melanocytes. In this study, special softjet cold atmospheric plasma was used to treat three different human melanoma cells using air and N2 gases to check the anti-melanoma activity. The physical effects by plasma revealed an increase in the temperature with the gradual reduction in pH at 60 sec, 180 sec and 300 sec air and N2 plasma treatment. Cellular toxicity revealed a decreased in cell survival (~50% cell survival using air gas and <~60% cell survival using N2 gas at 60 sec plasma treatment in G-361 cells). Gene analysis by q-PCR revealed that 3 min and 5 min air and N2 plasma treatment activated apoptotic pathways by triggering apoptotic genes in all three melanoma cell lines. The apoptosis was confirmed by DAPI staining and its related pathways were further explored according to protein-protein docking, and their probable activation mechanism was revealed. The pathways highlighted that activation of apoptosis which leads to cellular cascades and hence stimulation ASK1 (docking method) revealed that softjet plasma can be an effective modality for human melanoma treatment."
"Background/objectivesAlthough sleep duration is well established as a risk factor for child obesity, how measures of sleep quality relate to body size is less certain. The aim of this study was to determine how objectively measured sleep duration, sleep timing, and sleep quality were related to body mass index (BMI) cross-sectionally and longitudinally in school-aged children.Subjects/methodsAll measures were obtained at baseline, 12 and 24 months in 823 children (51% female, 53% European, 18% Māori, 12% Pacific, 9% Asian) aged 6–10 years at baseline. Sleep duration, timing, and quality were measured using actigraphy over 7 days, height and weight were measured using standard techniques, and parents completed questionnaires on demographics (baseline only), dietary intake, and television usage. Data were analysed using imputation; mixed models, with random effects for person and age, estimated both a cross-sectional effect and a longitudinal effect on BMI z-score, adjusted for multiple confounders.ResultsThe estimate of the effect on BMI z-score for each additional hour of sleep was −0.22 (95% CI: −0.33, −0.11) in cross-sectional analyses and −0.05 (−0.10, −0.004) in longitudinal analyses. A greater effect was observed for weekday sleep duration than weekend sleep duration but variability in duration was not related to BMI z-score. While sleep timing (onset or midpoint of sleep) was not related to BMI, children who were awake in the night more frequently (0.19; 0.06, 0.32) or for longer periods (0.18; 0.06, 0.36) had significantly higher BMI z-scores cross-sectionally, but only the estimates for total time awake (minutes) were significant longitudinally (increase in BMI z-score of 0.04 for each additional hour awake).ConclusionThe beneficial effect of a longer sleep duration on BMI was consistent in children, whereas evidence for markers of sleep quality and timing were more variable."
"Cognitive impairment is a central aspect of schizophrenia (SCZ) that occurs at the onset of the disease and is related to poor social function and outcome in patients with SCZ. Recent literatures have revealed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to be one of the efficient medical interventions for cognitive impairments. However, no study has been conducted to investigate the treatment effectiveness of 20 Hz rTMS with neuronavigation system administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with schizophrenia. In this randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled study, 56 patients were enrolled in 20 Hz rTMS (n = 28) or sham stimulation (n = 28) over left DLPFC for 8 weeks. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was performed to measure the cognitive function at baseline and after 8 weeks of rTMS treatment. The positive and negative syndrome scales (PANSS) was performed to assess the clinical symptoms at baseline, after 2-week treatment, 4-week treatment, 6-week treatment, and 8-week treatment. Totally, 15 subjects (seven in active group and eight in sham group) dropped out during the trial and the main findings were from completed 41 patients. At 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks, there were no significant differences in PANSS total score and subscores between the sham and treatment groups. At 8 weeks, the 20 Hz rTMS significantly increased the immediate memory score compared with the sham. Furthermore, the improvement in the immediate memory score was correlated with the decrease in the excitement factor score of the patients with SCZ. Our results suggest that 20 Hz rTMS appears to be an effective treatment for improving the cognitive performance and reducing the clinical symptoms of patients with SCZ."
"Intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients with scoliosis and spondylodesis requires image guidance, which is preferably achieved with multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). As long-term treatment is necessary and patients are young, radiation doses should be reduced to a minimum whilst a sufficient image quality for precise interventional performance should be kept. We compared 44 MDCT standard-dose scans (133.0–200.0 mA) with a hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose4) to 20 low-dose scans (20.0–67.0 mA) with iterative model reconstruction (IMR), which were performed for procedure planning of intrathecal nusinersen administration in 13 adult patients with SMA and complex spinal conditions. Qualitative image evaluation, including confidence for intervention planning, was performed by two neuroradiologists for standard- and low-dose scans. All 64 MDCT-guided intrathecal administrations of nusinersen were successful. The dose length product (DLP) was significantly lower when using low-dose scanning with IMR (median DLP of standard-dose scans: 92.0 mGy•cm vs. low-dose scans: 34.5 mGy•cm; p < 0.0001). Image quality was significantly reduced for low-dose compared to standard-dose scanning. However, bone/soft tissue contrast and confidence for intervention planning were not significantly impaired in low-dose MDCT according to both readers, showing good inter-reader agreement. Thus, we hereby demonstrate a low-dose MDCT protocol combined with advanced image reconstruction for scanning during procedure planning as a viable option for image guidance in intrathecal nusinersen treatment of adult SMA patients with complex spinal conditions."
"Disease can induce changes to subcellular components, altering cell phenotype and leading to measurable bulk-material mechanical properties. The mechanical phenotyping of single cells therefore offers many potential diagnostic applications. Cells are viscoelastic and their response to an applied stress is highly dependent on the magnitude and timescale of the actuation. Microfluidics can be used to measure cell deformability over a wide range of flow conditions, operating two distinct flow regimes (shear and inertial) which can expose subtle mechanical properties arising from subcellular components. Here, we investigate the deformability of three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines using a range of flow conditions. These cell lines offer a model for CRC metastatic progression; SW480 derived from primary adenocarcinoma, HT29 from a more advanced primary tumor and SW620 from lymph-node metastasis. HL60 (leukemia cells) were also studied as a model circulatory cell, offering a non-epithelial comparison. We demonstrate that microfluidic induced flow deformation can be used to robustly detect mechanical changes associated with CRC progression. We also show that single-cell multivariate analysis, utilising deformation and relaxation dynamics, offers potential to distinguish these different cell types. These results point to the benefit of multiparameter determination for improving detection and accuracy of disease stage diagnosis."
"The isomerisation of azo dyes can induce conformational changes which have potential applications in medicine and environmental protection. We developed an agar diffusion assay to test the capture and release of biologically active molecules from an azo electro-optic polymer, Poly (Disperse Red 1 methacrylate) (DR1/PMMA). The assay monitors the growth of bacteria placed in soft agar under a glass coverslip. Antibiotics can then be applied on the coverslip resulting in the clearance of the area under the coverslip due to growth inhibition. This assay demonstrates that DR1/PMMA is able to capture either tetracycline or ampicillin and the relative amount of DR1/PMMA required for capture was determined. Finally, the active antibiotics can be released from DR1/PMMA by exposure to green laser light. Exposure to white light from a torch or to heat does not release the antibiotic."
"Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are a major source of gynecologic morbidity in reproductive age women and are characterized by the excessive deposition of a disorganized extracellular matrix, resulting in rigid benign tumors. Although down regulation of the transcription factor AP-1 is highly prevalent in leiomyomas, the functional consequence of AP-1 loss on gene transcription in uterine fibroids remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution ChIP-sequencing, promoter capture Hi-C, and RNA-sequencing of matched normal and leiomyoma tissues, here we show that modified enhancer architecture is a major driver of transcriptional dysregulation in MED12 mutant uterine leiomyomas. Furthermore, modifications in enhancer architecture are driven by the depletion of AP-1 occupancy on chromatin. Silencing of AP-1 subunits in primary myometrium cells leads to transcriptional dysregulation of extracellular matrix associated genes and partly recapitulates transcriptional and epigenetic changes observed in leiomyomas. These findings establish AP-1 driven aberrant enhancer regulation as an important mechanism of leiomyoma disease pathogenesis."
"BackgroundThis study reports the long-term visual and treatment outcomes in a whole-population, orthoptic-delivered pre-school visual screening (PSVS) programme in Scotland and further examines their associations with socioeconomic backgrounds and home circumstances.MethodsRetrospective case review was conducted on 430 children who failed PSVS. Outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), severity of amblyopia (mild, moderate and severe), binocular vision (BV) (normal, poor and none), ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment modalities. Parameters at discharge were compared to those at baseline and were measured against the Scottish index of multiple deprivation (SIMD) and Health plan indicator (HPI), which are indices of deprivation and status of home circumstances.ResultsThe proportion of children with amblyopia reduced from 92.3% (373/404) at baseline to 29.1% (106/364) at discharge (p < 0.001). Eighty percent (291/364) had good BV at discharge compared to 29.2% (118/404) at baseline (p < 0.001). Children from more socioeconomically deprived areas (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.01–4.30, p = 0.003) or adverse family backgrounds (OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.99–7.74, p = 0.002) were more likely to attend poorly and/or become lost to follow-up. Children from worse home circumstances were five times more likely to have residual amblyopia (OR 5.37, 95% CI 3.29–10.07, p < 0.001) and three times more likely to have poor/no BV (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.49–4.66, p < 0.001) than those from better home circumstances.ConclusionsOrthoptic-delivered PSVS is successful at screening and managing amblyopia. Children from homes requiring social care input are less likely to attend and are more likely to have poorer visual outcomes."
"In patients with immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, depth of hematologic response correlates with both organ response and overall survival. Our group has demonstrated that screening with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is a quick, sensitive, and accurate means to diagnose and monitor the serum of patients with plasma cell disorders. Microflow liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole TOF MS adds further sensitivity. We identified 33 patients with AL amyloidosis who achieved amyloid complete hematologic response, who also had negative bone marrow by six-color flow cytometry, and who had paired serum samples to test by MS. These samples were subjected to blood MS. Four patients (12%) were found to have residual disease by these techniques. The presence of residual disease by MS was associated with a poorer time to progression (at 50 months 75% versus 13%, p = 0.003). MS of the blood out-performed serum and urine immunofixation, the serum immunoglobulin free light chain, and six-color flow cytometry of the bone marrow in detecting residual disease. Additional studies that include urine MS and next-generation techniques to detect clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow will further elucidate the full potential of this technique."
"Accurate quantification of synaptic changes is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic toxicity. Here we demonstrate a robust high-content imaging method for the assessment of synaptic changes and apply the method to brain homogenates from an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. Our method uses serial imaging of endogenous fluorescent labeled presynaptic VAMP2 and postsynaptic PSD95 in long-term cultured live primary neurons in 96 well microplates, and uses automatic image analysis to quantify the number of colocalized mature synaptic puncta for the assessment of synaptic changes in live neurons. As a control, we demonstrated that our synaptic puncta assay is at least 10-fold more sensitive to the toxic effects of glutamate than the MTT assay. Using our assay, we have compared synaptotoxic activities in size-exclusion chromatography fractioned protein samples from 3xTg-AD mouse model brain homogenates. Multiple synaptotoxic activities were found in high and low molecular weight fractions. Amyloid-beta immunodepletion alleviated some but not all of the synaptotoxic activities. Although the biochemical entities responsible for the synaptotoxic activities have yet to be determined, these proof-of-concept results demonstrate that this novel assay may have many potential mechanistic and therapeutic applications."
"Identifying patient-specific clonal IGH/TCR junctional sequences is critical for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Conventionally these junctional sequences are identified using laborious Sanger sequencing of excised heteroduplex bands. We found that the IGH is highly expressed in our diagnostic B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples using RNA-Seq. Therefore, we used RNA-Seq to identify IGH disease clone sequences in 258 childhood B-ALL samples for MRD monitoring. The amount of background IGH rearrangements uncovered by RNA-Seq followed the Zipf’s law with IGH disease clones easily identified as outliers. Four hundred and ninety-seven IGH disease clones (median 2, range 0–7 clones/patient) are identified in 90.3% of patients. High hyperdiploid patients have the most IGH disease clones (median 3) while DUX4 subtype has the least (median 1) due to the rearrangements involving the IGH locus. In all, 90.8% of IGH disease clones found by Sanger sequencing are also identified by RNA-Seq. In addition, RNA-Seq identified 43% more IGH disease clones. In 69 patients lacking sensitive IGH targets, targeted NGS IGH MRD showed high correlation (R = 0.93; P = 1.3 × 10−14), better relapse prediction than conventional RQ-PCR MRD using non-IGH targets. In conclusion, RNA-Seq can identify patient-specific clonal IGH junctional sequences for MRD monitoring, adding to its usefulness for molecular diagnosis in childhood B-ALL."
"Optic Pathway Glioma (OPG) is a relatively common brain tumour in childhood; however, there is scarce understanding of neuropsychological sequelae in these survivors. In this study, 12 children with diagnosis of OPG before 6 years of age received a comprehensive standardised assessment of visual perception, general intelligence and academic achievement, using adjustments to visual materials of the tests, to examine the extent of concurrent impairment in these functional domains. Information about vision, clinical and socio-demographic factors were extracted from medical records to assess the associations of neuropsychological outcomes with clinical and socio-demographic factors. Children with OPG exhibited high within-patient variability and moderate group-level impairment compared to test norms. Visual perception was the most impaired domain, while scholastic progression was age-appropriate overall. For cognition, core verbal and visuo-spatial reasoning skills were intact, whereas deficits were found in working memory and processing speed. Visual function was associated with tasks that rely on visual input. Children with OPG are at moderate risk of neuropsychological impairment, especially for visual perception and cognitive proficiency. Future research should elucidate further the relative contribution of vision loss and neurofibromatosis type 1 co-diagnosis within a large sample."
"The human 16p11.2 gene locus is a hot spot for copy number variations, which predispose carriers to a range of neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Microduplications of 16p11.2 are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia (SZ). Despite the debilitating nature of 16p11.2 duplications, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we performed a comprehensive behavioral characterization of 16p11.2 duplication mice (16p11.2dp/+) and identified social and cognitive deficits reminiscent of ASD and ID phenotypes. 16p11.2dp/+ mice did not exhibit the SZ-related sensorimotor gating deficits, psychostimulant-induced hypersensitivity, or motor impairment. Electrophysiological recordings of 16p11.2dp/+ mice found deficient GABAergic synaptic transmission and elevated neuronal excitability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region critical for social and cognitive functions. RNA-sequencing identified genome-wide transcriptional aberrance in the PFC of 16p11.2dp/+ mice, including downregulation of the GABA synapse regulator Npas4. Restoring Npas4 expression in PFC of 16p11.2dp/+ mice ameliorated the social and cognitive deficits and reversed GABAergic synaptic impairment and neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that prefrontal cortical GABAergic synaptic circuitry and Npas4 are strongly implicated in 16p11.2 duplication pathology, and may represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ASD."
"Retinal gene therapy has shown great promise in treating retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a primary photoreceptor degeneration that leads to severe sight loss in young people. In the present study, we report the first-in-human phase 1/2, dose-escalation clinical trial for X-linked RP caused by mutations in the RP GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene in 18 patients over up to 6 months of follow-up (https://clinicaltrials.gov/: NCT03116113). The primary outcome of the study was safety, and secondary outcomes included visual acuity, microperimetry and central retinal thickness. Apart from steroid-responsive subretinal inflammation in patients at the higher doses, there were no notable safety concerns after subretinal delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding codon-optimized human RPGR (AAV8-coRPGR), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Visual field improvements beginning at 1 month and maintained to the last point of follow-up were observed in six patients."
"Background/ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to identify risk factors, prognosis, and management in patients with concomitant herpetic keratitis and acute retinal necrosis (ARN).Subjects/MethodsIn this retrospective observational series, ARN patients in the Greater Vancouver area from 2004 to 2018 were identified through key words, billing codes, and dispensing data from medical records of affiliate researchers and the pharmacy at Vancouver General Hospital.ResultsTwenty-eight patients were diagnosed with ARN during this period. Five of those were also diagnosed with herpetic keratitis. Thus, the incidence of combined keratitis and ARN was 18% of patients with ARN. The two diseases occurred concomitantly in four out of five patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 55 ± 17 years. Of the five patients with both corneal and retinal involvement, three patients were immunocompromised and three had a history of herpetic diseases. Three developed disciform keratitis and two developed stromal immune keratitis. Clinical management and outcomes of these patients did not differ from patients with ARN alone, except for a lower rate of retinal detachment (p = 0.006) and a higher proportion with visual acuity ≥ 20/200 (p = 0.01).ConclusionsKeratitis may complicate the clinical picture of one out of five to six patients with ARN. Comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including careful anterior segment exams in patients with ARN and sequential dilated fundus exams in patients with herpetic keratitis, should always be conducted to identify cases of concomitant disease."
"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a global health problem. At present, prior exposure to Mtb can be determined by blood-based interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), but active TB is not always detectable by blood tests such as CRP and ESR. This study was undertaken to investigate whether leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG), a new inflammatory biomarker, could be used to assess active disease of TB. Cynomolgus macaques pretreated with or without Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination were inoculated with Mtb to induce active TB. Blood was collected over time from these animals and levels of LRG as well as CRP and ESR were quantified. In the macaques without BCG vaccination, Mtb inoculation caused extensive TB and significantly increased plasma CRP and LRG levels, but not ESR. In the macaques with BCG vaccination, whereas Mtb challenge caused pulmonary TB, only LRG levels were significantly elevated. By immunohistochemical analysis of the lung, LRG was visualized in epithelioid cells and giant cells of the granulation tissue. In humans, serum LRG levels in TB patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls and declined one month after anti-tubercular therapy. These findings suggest that LRG is a promising biomarker when performed following IGRA for the detection of active TB."
"The inclusion of familial myeloid malignancies as a separate disease entity in the revised WHO classification has renewed efforts to improve the recognition and management of this group of at risk individuals. Here we report a cohort of 86 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) families with 49 harboring germline variants in 16 previously defined loci (57%). Whole exome sequencing in a further 37 uncharacterized families (43%) allowed us to rationalize 65 new candidate loci, including genes mutated in rare hematological syndromes (ADA, GP6, IL17RA, PRF1 and SEC23B), reported in prior MDS/AML or inherited bone marrow failure series (DNAH9, NAPRT1 and SH2B3) or variants at novel loci (DHX34) that appear specific to inherited forms of myeloid malignancies. Altogether, our series of MDS/AML families offer novel insights into the etiology of myeloid malignancies and provide a framework to prioritize variants for inclusion into routine diagnostics and patient management."
"Responses to vaccination and to diseases vary widely across individuals, which may be partly due to baseline immune variations. Identifying such baseline predictors of immune responses and their biological basis is of broad interest, given their potential importance for cancer immunotherapy, disease outcomes, vaccination and infection responses. Here we uncover baseline blood transcriptional signatures predictive of antibody responses to both influenza and yellow fever vaccinations in healthy subjects. These same signatures evaluated at clinical quiescence are correlated with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with plasmablast-associated flares. CITE-seq profiling of 82 surface proteins and transcriptomes of 53,201 single cells from healthy high and low influenza vaccination responders revealed that our signatures reflect the extent of activation in a plasmacytoid dendritic cell–type I IFN–T/B lymphocyte network. Our findings raise the prospect that modulating such immune baseline states may improve vaccine responsiveness and mitigate undesirable autoimmune disease activity."
"Microgravity affects plant growth and content. A three-dimensional clinostat was used at 4 rotations/min to rotate the seeds of Triticum aestivum cultivar (Ammon) in three dimensions for 7 days, following which the antioxidant activities of ethanolic extracts were evaluated using both nitric oxide- and hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activities. The antidiabetic activities of ethanolic extracts were evaluated by measuring the concentration of plasma glucose, insulin, C peptide, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); determining the number of β cells in the pancreatic islets; and performing the glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the effects of the ethanolic extracts on the lipid profile and liver function were estimated. After rats were sacrificed, their pancreases were isolated and used for histopathological processing. The results indicated that the antioxidant potential and antioxidant metabolite content were significantly increased under microgravity conditions in comparison to those under normal gravity conditions. Rats treated with an extract of wheatgrass (T. aestivum) germinated over a period of 6–10 days under microgravity (WGM) showed a significant reduction in the levels of serum glucose, HbA1C, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and insulin resistance compared to rats treated with an extract of wheatgrass germinated under gravity. Additionally, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-peptide, and insulin levels rose significantly after treatment with T. aestivum germinated under microgravity. WGM is a promising potential diabetic treatment without side effects with a low manufacturing cost."
"The objective of the present study was to explore past and future primary health care use in preadolescents reporting frequent non-specific health complaints or a low self-rated health compared to that of preadolescents with no frequent health complaints or with good self-rated health. The study was conducted as a cohort study based within the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996–2002). Information on non-specific health complaints and self-rated health was obtained by an 11-year follow-up questionnaire. Information about number of general practitioner (GP) contacts was obtained from the Health Insurance Service Register. A total of 44,877 pre-adolescents gave complete exposure information. Pre-adolescents who reported frequent non-specific health complaints had a higher use of GP compared to pre-adolescents without complaints across the five years following the index date (somatic complaints: IRR = (1.46 [1.38; 1.55], mental complaints: IRR = 1.16 [1.12; 1.19], both complaints: IRR = 1.58 [1.47; 1.69]). The same pattern was found for the association between low self-rated health and number of GP contacts (IRR = 1.41 (1.36; 1.46)). Non-specific health complaints and a poor self-rated health in pre-adolescents was associated with a higher past and future use of GP, indicating a need for development of early interventions with help for symptom management."
"Insulin resistance increases patients’ risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and a host of other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and cancer. At the molecular level, insulin exerts its function through the insulin receptor (IR), a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Data from human genetic studies have shown that Grb14 functions as a negative modulator of IR activity, and the germline Grb14-knockout (KO) mice have improved insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle. Here, we show that Grb14 knockdown in liver, white adipose tissues, and heart with an AAV-shRNA (Grb14-shRNA) improves glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. A previous report has shown that germline deletion of Grb14 in mice results in cardiac hypertrophy and impaired systolic function, which could severely limit the therapeutic potential of targeting Grb14. In this report, we demonstrate that there are no significant changes in cardiac function as measured by echocardiography in the Grb14-knockdown mice fed a high-fat diet for a period of four months. While additional studies are needed to further confirm the efficacy and to de-risk potential negative cardiac effects in preclinical models, our data support the therapeutic strategy of inhibiting Grb14 to treat diabetes and related conditions."
"Optic neuropathy is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and no effective treatment is currently available. Secondary degeneration is believed to be the major contributor to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, the endpoint of optic neuropathy. Partial optic nerve transection (pONT) is an established model of optic neuropathy. Although the mechanisms of primary and secondary degeneration have been delineated in this model, until now how this is influenced by therapy is not well-understood. In this article, we describe a clinically translatable topical, neuroprotective treatment (recombinant human nerve growth factor, rh-NGF) predominantly targeting secondary degeneration in a pONT rat model. Topical application of rh-NGF twice daily for 3 weeks significantly improves RGC survival as shown by reduced RGC apoptosis in vivo and increased RGC population in the inferior retina, which is predominantly affected in this model by secondary degeneration. Topical rh-NGF also promotes greater axonal survival and inhibits astrocyte activity in the optic nerve. Collectively, these results suggest that topical rh-NGF exhibits neuroprotective effects on retinal neurons via influencing secondary degeneration process. As topical rh-NGF is already involved in early clinical trials, this highlights its potential in multiple indications in patients, including those affected by glaucomatous optic neuropathy."
"Multidimensional correlation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an emerging imaging modality that is capable of disentangling highly heterogeneous and opaque systems according to chemical and physical interactions of water within them. Using this approach, the conventional three dimensional MR scalar images are replaced with spatially resolved multidimensional spectra. The ensuing abundance in microstructural and chemical information is a blessing that incorporates a real challenge: how does one distill and refine it into images while retaining its significant components? In this paper we introduce a general framework that preserves the spectral information from spatially resolved multidimensional data. Equal weight is given to significant spectral components at the single voxel level, resulting in a summarized image spectrum. This spectrum is then used to define spectral regions of interest that are utilized to reconstruct images of sub-voxel components. Using numerical simulations we first show that, contrary to the conventional approach, the proposed framework preserves spectral resolution, and in turn, sensitivity and specificity of the reconstructed images. The retained spectral resolution allows, for the first time, to observe an array of distinct \({T}_{1}\)−\({T}_{2}\)−\(\langle D\rangle \) components images of the human brain. The robustly generated images of sub-voxel components overcome the limited spatial resolution of MRI, thus advancing multidimensional correlation MRI to fulfilling its full potential."
"Renal fibrosis arises by the generation of matrix-producing fibroblasts and myofibroblasts through the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in which epithelial cells undergo a transition into a fibroblast phenotype. A key feature of the EMT is the reorganization of the cytoskeletons, which may involve the Ca2+-binding protein S100A16, a newly reported member of the S100 protein family. However, very few studies have examined the role of S100A16 in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In this study, S100A16 expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining of kidney biopsy specimens from patients with various nephropathies and kidney tissues from a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model. Renal histological changes were investigated in S100A16Tg, S100A16+/−, and WT mouse kidneys after UUO. The expression of epithelia marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, and vimentin, extracellular matrix protein, and S100A16, as well as the organization of F-actin, were investigated in S100A16 overexpression or knockdown HK-2 cells. Mass spectrometry was employed to screen for S100A16 binding proteins in HK-2 cells. The results indicated that S100A16 is high expressed and associated with renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in patient kidney biopsies and in those from UUO mice. S100A16 promotes renal interstitial fibrosis in UUO mice. S100A16 expression responded to increasing Ca2+ and interacted with myosin-9 during kidney injury or TGF-β stimulation to promote cytoskeleton reorganization and EMT progression in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Therefore, S100A16 is a critical regulator of renal tubulointerstitial fibroblast activation and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of renal fibrosis."
"Possible ectopic parathyroid hormone (PTH) production in adipose tissues surrounding hyperplastic parathyroid glands was examined in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). In vitro culture of adipose tissues from 31 patients excised during parathyroidectomy showed PTH secretion in 23 (74.2%) patients. In vitro PTH secretion was detected in adipose tissues adhered to the parathyroid glands from 22 (71.0%) patients, in not-adhered adipose from 11 (35.5%) and in the thymus from four (28.6%) patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed colonies of PTH- and GCM2-positive cells intricately intertwined with adipocytes in excised adipose tissues prior to culture. When pieces of parathyroid parenchyma from SHPT patients were transplanted into the thyroid of immunodeficient nude rats with induced SHPT, the transplants secreted human PTH for one to three-and-half months after transplantation and expressed adipocyte markers, PPARγ2 and perilipin A, that the transplants did not express prior to transplantation. These findings indicate the importance of thoroughly removing adipose tissues surrounding the parathyroid glands when performing parathyroidectomy. We speculate that these ectopic PTH-producing cells are parathyroid parenchymal cells pushed out from the glands along with adipocyte progenitors during nodular growth of hyperplastic parenchymal cells and that these cells proliferate in SHPT, forming colonies PTH-producing cells intricately intertwined with adipocytes."
"Gastric carcinoma (GC) locoregional recurrence may occur even in cases where the tumor has been completely resected, possibly due to lymph node (LN) micrometastases. It is estimated that in 10% to 30% of cases, LN micrometastases are not detected by a conventional method for histological assessment of LN metastases with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). A cross-sectional study assessed 51 patients with GC by histological evaluation of the LN micrometastases through LN multi sectioning associated with immunohistochemistry analysis with monoclonal antibodies AE1 and AE3. Total gastrectomy was performed in 51% of patients. The total number of resected LN nodes was 1698, with a mean number of resected LN of 33.3 ± 13.2 per surgical specimen, of which 187 had metastasis. After the application of LN multisection and immunohistochemistry, LN micrometastases were found in 45.1% of the cases. LN staging changed in 29.4%, and tumor staging changed in 23.5% of the cases. In patients initially staged as pN0, LN staging and tumor staging changed, both in 19.2% of the cases. In patients initially staged as pN1 or more, LN staging changed in 40.0% of them, and tumor staging changed in 28.0% of the cases. The accuracy of HE for the histological staging of LN tumoral involvement was 76%, which was considered insufficient for CG patients staging. Investigation of LN micrometastasis through LN multisection and immunohistochemistry should be performed, particularly in cases where the presence of blood and lymphatic vessel invasion has been identified after conventional histological analysis, as well as in patients with advanced GC."
"Although several risk factors have been reported for cervical ossification of the longitudinal ligament (OPLL), most evaluations made in the past were based on plain X-ray, not on computed tomography (CT) scan. In this study, we aimed to clarify novel risk factors for cervical OPLL in asymptomatic subjects undergoing CT scan as their routine medical checkups. A total of 1789 Japanese asymptomatic subjects who underwent CT scan for the whole body as their routine medical checkups were retrospectively reviewed. The medical checkup also included laboratory examinations, bone mineral status, and ultrasound of the carotid artery. As a result, cervical OPLL was seen in 120 subjects (6.7%). As we compared the demographic and clinical data between subjects with and without OPLL, OPLL group showed older age, higher proportion of male sex, higher BMI, higher incidence of hypertension, higher levels of blood HbA1c and triglyceride, and higher incidence of plaques in the carotid artery. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (Odds ratio (OR):1.03), male sex (OR: 1.91), and the presence of plaque in the carotid artery (OR: 1.71) were risk factors for OPLL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal an association between OPLL and arteriosclerotic lesions."
"Tumours vary in gene expression programmes and genetic alterations. Understanding this diversity and its biological meaning requires a theoretical framework, which could in turn guide the development of more accurate prognosis and therapy. Here, we review the theory of multi-task evolution of cancer, which is based upon the premise that tumours evolve in the host and face selection trade-offs between multiple biological functions. This theory can help identify the major biological tasks that cancer cells perform and the trade-offs between these tasks. It introduces the concept of specialist tumours, which focus on one task, and generalist tumours, which perform several tasks. Specialist tumours are suggested to be sensitive to therapy targeting their main task. Driver mutations tune gene expression towards specific tasks in a tissue-dependent manner and thus help to determine whether a tumour is specialist or generalist. We discuss potential applications of the theory of multi-task evolution to interpret the spatial organization of tumours and intratumour heterogeneity."
"Although guidelines recommend BRCA testing for all women with non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, there is significant variability in access to testing across the UK. A germline BRCA mutation (BRCAm) in ovarian cancer patients provides prognostic and predictive information and influences clinical management, such as the use of PARP inhibitors, which have demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit in the BRCAm cohort. Additionally, the finding of a BRCAm has significant implications for patients and their families in terms of cancer risk and prevention. We studied the impact of a newly-formed, oncologist-led ‘mainstreaming’ germline BRCA testing pathway in 255 ovarian cancer patients at Imperial College NHS Trust. Prior to the establishment of ‘mainstreaming’, uptake of germline BRCA testing was 14% with a mean turnaround time of 148.2 calendar days. The ‘mainstreaming’ approach led to a 95% uptake of germline BRCA testing and a mean turnaround time of 20.6 days. Thirty-four (13.33%) BRCAm patients were identified. At the time of data collection nine BRCAm patients had received a PARP inhibitor off-trial, three had entered a PARP inhibitor trial and 5 were receiving platinum-based chemotherapy with a plan to receive PARP inhibitor maintenance. This study provides further evidence of the impact of oncologist-led ‘mainstreaming’ programs."
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to determine the macular changes using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A) in eyes with high myopia. Determining the alterations in vascular structures can provide a clearer understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease and help define new treatment options and preventive measures.Materials and methodsNinety-two patients with high myopia (axial length ≥ 26 mm) and 70 control cases without any known systemic or ocular diseases were enrolled in this prospective study. One eye of each patient was included in the statistical analyses.ResultsRetinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) macula map values were lower in myopia compared with the controls. Both superior and inferior ganglion cell complex (GCC) thicknesses were significantly thinner in the high myopia compared with the controls (p < 0.001). Regarding the OCT-A findings, although superficial or deep foveal avascular zones (FAZ) did not significantly differ between the two groups, the density values of superficial and deep microvessels were significantly lower in the high myopia group compared with the control cases.ConclusionsIn patients with high myopia, with an increase in the axial length and a decrease in RNFL and GCC thicknesses, the vascular densities of the superficial and deep retina were reduced in the macular region."
"There are limited studies on the association between systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) and leptospirosis. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of leptospirosis on the risks of developing SARDs with a nationwide retrospective cohort study. Patients with leptospirosis who did not have a diagnosis of SARDs before the index date were enrolled from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2010, as the leptospirosis cohort. For each patient with leptospirosis, one control without a history of leptospirosis and SARDs was randomly selected (non-leptospirosis cohort). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the risk of SARDs according to sex, age, and comorbidities. Among the 23 million people in the cohort, 3,393 patients with leptospirosis (68.91% men, mean age 52.65 years) and 33,930 controls were followed for 18,778 and 232,999 person-years, respectively. The incidence of SARDs was higher in the leptospirosis cohort than in the non-leptospirosis cohort (1.38 vs 0.33 per 1000 person-years), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.82–6.92). The risk of developing SARDs was highest for leptospirosis patients aged ≥65 years (HR = 2.81% CI = 1.07–7.36) compared with patients aged ≤39 years. Patients with leptospirosis have a 4.42-fold higher risk of SARDs than that in the general population. Further research is warranted to investigate the mechanism underlying this association."
"Lymphatic spread determines treatment decisions in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT can be performed, although cost remains high and availability is limited. Therefore, computed tomography (CT) continues to be the most used modality for PCa staging. We assessed if convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to determine 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-lymph node status from CT alone. In 549 patients with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging, 2616 lymph nodes were segmented. Using PET as a reference standard, three CNNs were trained. Training sets balanced for infiltration status, lymph node location and additionally, masked images, were used for training. CNNs were evaluated using a separate test set and performance was compared to radiologists’ assessments and random forest classifiers. Heatmaps maps were used to identify the performance determining image regions. The CNNs performed with an Area-Under-the-Curve of 0.95 (status balanced) and 0.86 (location balanced, masked), compared to an AUC of 0.81 of experienced radiologists. Interestingly, CNNs used anatomical surroundings to increase their performance, “learning” the infiltration probabilities of anatomical locations. In conclusion, CNNs have the potential to build a well performing CT-based biomarker for lymph node metastases in PCa, with different types of class balancing strongly affecting CNN performance."
"Connections between neuronal populations may be genetically hardwired or random. In the insect olfactory system, projection neurons of the antennal lobe connect randomly to Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. Consequently, while the odor responses of the projection neurons are stereotyped across individuals, the responses of the Kenyon cells are variable. Surprisingly, downstream of Kenyon cells, mushroom body output neurons show stereotypy in their responses. We found that the stereotypy is enabled by the convergence of inputs from many Kenyon cells onto an output neuron, and does not require learning. The stereotypy emerges in the total response of the Kenyon cell population using multiple odor-specific features of the projection neuron responses, benefits from the nonlinearity in the transfer function, depends on the convergence:randomness ratio, and is constrained by sparseness. Together, our results reveal the fundamental mechanisms and constraints with which convergence enables stereotypy in sensory responses despite random connectivity."
"Navigation ability is particularly sensitive to aging. Evidence of aging patterns is largely restricted to comparing young adults and elderly and limited in the variety of navigation tasks used. Therefore, we designed a novel task battery to assess navigation ability in a very large, representative sample (N = 11,887, 8–100 years). The main aim was to measure navigation ability across the lifespan in a brief, yet comprehensive manner. Tasks included landmark knowledge, egocentric and allocentric location knowledge, and path knowledge for a route and survey perspective. Additionally, factors that potentially contribute to navigation ability were considered; gender, spatial experience and spatial anxiety. Increase in performance with age in children was found for allocentric location knowledge and for route-based path knowledge. Age related decline was found for all five tasks, each with clearly discernible aging patterns, substantiated the claim that each task distinctively contributes to the assessment of navigation ability. This study provides an in depth examination of navigation ability across dissociable functional domains and describes cognitive changes across the lifespan. The outcome supports the use of this task battery for brief assessment of navigation for experimental and clinical purposes."
"Early evaluation of treatment response and prediction of disease evolution are key issues in the management of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the past 20 years, MRI has become the most useful paraclinical tool in both situations and is used clinically to assess the inflammatory component of the disease, particularly the presence and evolution of focal lesions — the pathological hallmark of MS. However, diffuse neurodegenerative processes that are at least partly independent of inflammatory mechanisms can develop early in people with MS and are closely related to disability. The effects of these neurodegenerative processes at a macroscopic level can be quantified by estimation of brain and spinal cord atrophy with MRI. MRI measurements of atrophy in MS have also been proposed as a complementary approach to lesion assessment to facilitate the prediction of clinical outcomes and to assess treatment responses. In this Consensus statement, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS) study group critically review the application of brain and spinal cord atrophy in clinical practice in the management of MS, considering the role of atrophy measures in prognosis and treatment monitoring and the barriers to clinical use of these measures. On the basis of this review, the group makes consensus statements and recommendations for future research."
"BackgroundMolecular and immunohistochemistry-based profiling of prostatic adenocarcinoma has revealed frequent Androgen Receptor (AR) gene and protein alterations in metastatic disease. This includes an AR-null non-neuroendocrine phenotype of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer which may be less sensitive to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors. This AR-null non-neuroendocrine phenotype is thought to be associated with TP53 and RB1 alterations. Herein, we have correlated molecular profiling of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer with AR/P53/RB immunohistochemistry and relevant clinical correlates.DesignTwenty-seven cases of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer were evaluated using histopathologic examination to rule out neuroendocrine differentiation. A combination of a hybridization exon-capture next-generation sequencing-based assay (n = 26), fluorescence in situ hybridization for AR copy number status (n = 16), and immunohistochemistry for AR (n = 27), P53 (n = 24) and RB (n = 25) was used to profile these cases.ResultsOf 27 metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer cases, 17 had AR amplification and showed positive nuclear expression of AR by immunohistochemistry. Nine cases lacked AR copy number alterations using next-generation sequencing/fluorescence in situ hybridization. A subset of these metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer cases demonstrated the AR-null phenotype by immunohistochemistry (five cases and one additional case where next-generation sequencing failed). Common co-alterations in these cases involved the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes and all these patients received prior therapy with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide).ConclusionsOur study suggests that AR immunohistochemistry may distinguish AR-null from AR-expressing cases in the metastatic setting. AR-null status informs clinical decision-making regarding continuation of therapy with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors and consideration of other treatment options. This might be a relevant and cost-effective diagnostic strategy when there is limited access and/or limited tumor material for molecular testing."
"Sodium is an essential component of the human body, with known influences on obesity. This paper reports the effect of cube natural sea salt (CNS) on the reduction of obesity in high fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, by ameliorating the obesity parameters and obesity-related gene mechanisms. The suppression of high fat diet-induced obesity and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by sea salt depends on the manufacturing process and mineral content. The manufacturing method using only new sea water (Cube natural sea salt) decreases the magnesium (Mg) and sulfur (S) content in the salt with different crystallization and morphologies, compared to the general manufacturing method (Generally manufactured sea salt, GS). Mg in salt is known to considerably affect obesity; an appropriate concentration of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) reduces lipid accumulation significantly and regulates the lipogenesis and liver enzyme activity. Our results indicate that sea salt contains an appropriate level of Mg as compared to table salt (purified salt, NaCl), and is important for regulating obesity, as observed in the in vivo and in vitro anti-obesity effects of CNS. The Mg content and mineral ratio of sea salt are important factors that ameliorate the lipid metabolism and liver enzyme activity in high fat diet induced obesity, and contents of Mg in sea salt can be altered by modifying the manufacturing process."
"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is described as a bilateral disease with inter-eye symmetry that presents on short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW-AF) imaging with hyperautofluorescent (hyperAF) rings with an ellipsoid shape and regular borders. Nevertheless, both asymmetry and irregular ring morphologies are also observed. In this retrospective study of 168 RP patients, we characterize the degree of inter-eye asymmetry and frequency of irregular hyperAF ring morphologies according to mode of inheritance and disease-causing gene by using SW-AF imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans. We observed that from 336 eyes, 290 (86%) presented with regular hyperAF rings and 46 (14%) presented with irregular shapes. From the 168 patients, 23 (14%) presented with asymmetric disease, with 16 (70%) of these patients also presenting with irregular ring shapes. Patients with autosomal dominant RP (adRP) had the highest proportion of irregular ring shapes (21%) and disease asymmetry (23%) in comparison to other modes of inheritance. Furthermore, both RP1 and RHO-adRP had the highest proportions of both disease asymmetry and irregular ring morphology. Our results suggest that in patients presenting with either irregular ring shapes or asymmetric disease, emphasis should be placed in targeted gene sequencing of genes known to cause adRP, such as RHO and RP1."
"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor that primarily affects children and adolescents. Studies suggested that dysregulation JAK/STAT signaling promotes the development of OS. Cells treated with pimozide, a STAT5 inhibitor suppressed proliferation and colony formation and induced sub G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. There was a reduction in cyclin D1 and CDK2 expression and Rb phosphorylation, and activation of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In addition, pimozide suppressed the formation of 3-dimensional osteospheres and growth of the cells in the Tumor in a Dish lung organoid system. Furthermore, there was a reduction in expression of cancer stem cell marker proteins DCLK1, CD44, CD133, Oct-4, and ABCG2. More importantly, it was the short form of DCLK1 that was upregulated in osteospheres, which was suppressed in response to pimozide. We further confirmed by flow cytometry a reduction in DCLK1+ cells. Moreover, pimozide inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT5, STAT3, and ERK in OS cells. Molecular docking studies suggest that pimozide interacts with STAT5A and STAT5B with binding energies of −8.4 and −6.4 Kcal/mol, respectively. Binding was confirmed by cellular thermal shift assay. To further understand the role of STAT5, we knocked down the two isoforms using specific siRNAs. While knockdown of the proteins did not affect the cells, knockdown of STAT5B reduced pimozide-induced necrosis and further enhanced late apoptosis. To determine the effect of pimozide on tumor growth in vivo, we administered pimozide intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW every day for 21 days in mice carrying KHOS/NP tumor xenografts. Pimozide treatment significantly suppressed xenograft growth. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses also demonstrated significant inhibition of stem cell marker proteins. Together, these data suggest that pimozide treatment suppresses OS growth by targeting both proliferating cells and stem cells at least in part by inhibiting the STAT5 signaling pathway."
"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an important histopathologic feature of colorectal cancer that confer prognostic information. Previous clinical and epidemiologic studies have found that the presence and quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are significantly associated with disease-specific and overall survival in colorectal cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, establishing pooled estimates for survival outcomes based on the presence of TILs in colon cancer. PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2017. Studies were included, in which the prognostic significance of intratumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, as well as subsets of CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD45R0 lymphocytes, were determined within the solid tumor center, the invasive margin, and tumor stroma. Random-effects models were calculated to estimated summary effects using hazard ratios. Forty-three relevant studies describing 21,015 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The results demonstrate that high levels of generalized TILS as compared to low levels had an improved overall survival (OS) with a HR of 0.65 (p = <0.01). In addition, histologically localized CD3+ T-cells at the tumor center were significantly associated with better disease-free survival (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.36–0.61, p = 0.05), and CD3 + cells at the invasive margin were associated with improved disease-free survival (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.38–0.86, p = 0.05). CD8+ T-cells at the tumor center had statistically significant prognostic value on cancer-specific survival and overall survival with HRs of 0.65 (p = 0.02) and 0.71 (p < 0.01), respectively. Lastly, FOXP3+ T-cells at the tumor center were associated with improved prognosis for cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.65, p < 0.01) and overall survival (HR = 0.70, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that TILs and specific TIL subsets serve as prognostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer."
"The use of immunotherapy to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) shows promise but is limited by our incomplete understanding of the immunologic milieu. In solid tumors, CD141Hi conventional dendritic cells (CD141Hi cDCs) are necessary for antitumor immunosurveillance and the response to immunotherapy. Here, we found that CD141Hi cDCs are reduced in MDS bone marrow and based on the premise established in solid tumors, we hypothesized that reduced numbers of CD141Hi cDCs are associated with inferior overall survival in MDS patients. We found that MDS patients with reduced numbers of CD141Hi cDCs, but not other DC populations, showed reduced overall survival. To examine the basis for reduction in CD141Hi cDCs, we found fewer numbers of progenitors committed to DC differentiation in the MDS bone marrow and these progenitors expressed lower levels of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), a master regulator of CD141Hi cDC differentiation. To rescue impaired CD141Hi cDC differentiation, we used pharmacologic inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) to promote CD141Hi cDC differentiation by MDS progenitors. These data reveal a previously unrecognized element of the MDS immunologic milieu. Epigenetic regulation of CD141Hi cDC differentiation offers an intriguing opportunity for intervention and a potential adjunct to immunotherapy for patients with MDS."

"Neuropathic pain is believed to arise from damage to nociceptive C fibres in diabetic neuropathy (DN). We have utilised corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) to quantify the severity of small nerve fibre damage in relation to the severity of neuropathic pain and quality of life (QoL) in patients with and without painful DN. 30 controls and patients with painful (n = 78) and painless (n = 62) DN underwent assessment of large and small nerve fibre function, CCM, neuropathic symptoms (small fibre neuropathy symptom inventory questionnaire, neuropathic pain scale) and QoL (SF-36, pre-R-ODS and hospital anxiety and depression scale). Patients with painful compared to painless DN, had comparable neurophysiology and vibration perception, but lower corneal nerve fibre density (20.1 ± 0.87 vs. 24.13 ± 0.91, P = 0.005), branch density (44.4 ± 3.31 vs. 57.74 ± 3.98, P = 0.03), length (19.61 ± 0.81 vs. 22.77 ± 0.83, P = 0.01), inferior whorl length (18.03 ± 1.46 vs. 25.1 ± 1.95, P = 0.005) and cold sensation threshold (21.35 ± 0.99 vs. 26.08 ± 0.5, P < 0.0001) and higher warm sensation threshold (43.7 ± 0.49 vs. 41.37 ± 0.51, P = 0.004) indicative of small fibre damage. There was a significant association between all CCM parameters and the severity of painful neuropathic symptoms, depression score and QoL. CCM identifies small nerve fibre loss, which correlates with the severity of neuropathic symptoms and reduced QoL in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy."
"Inflammatory joint conditions are characterized by synovial inflammation, which involves activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and production of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in joints. This study showed that the snake venom metalloprotease (SVMP) BaP1 activates FLSs to produce PGE2 by a mechanism dependent on COX-2, mPGES-1 and iPLA2s. BaP1 also induces IL-1β release, which up-regulates the production of PGE2 at a late stage of the stimulation. Expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 are induced by BaP1 via activation of NF-κB pathway. While NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits are involved in up-regulation of COX-2 expression, only p65 is involved in BaP1-induced mPGES-1 expression. In addition, BaP1 up-regulates EP4 receptor expression. Engagement of this receptor by PGE2 triggers a positive feedback loop for its production by up-regulating expression of key components of the PGE2 biosynthetic cascade (COX-2, mPGES-1 and the EP4 receptor), thus contributing to amplification of BaP1-induced effects in FLSs. These data highlight the importance of FLS as a target for metalloproteases in joint inflammation and provide new insights into the roles of MMPs in inflammatory joint diseases. Moreover, our results may give insights into the importance of the catalytic domain, of MMPs for the inflammatory activity of these enzymes."
"Prevention for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is limited by the lack of a single predictor. As activin A is upregulated in heart failure and chronic kidney disease, we aimed to clarify the association between activin A levels and renal outcomes after coronary angiography (CAG). This prospective observational study included 267 patients who received CAG between 2009 and 2015. CIN was defined as elevation of serum creatinine to >0.5 mg/dL or to >25% above baseline within 48 hours after CAG. During follow-up, laboratory parameters were measured every 3–6 months. Renal decline was defined as>2-fold increase in serum creatinine or initiation of dialysis. The patients were stratified into tertiles according to serum activin A levels at baseline. High activin A tertile was significantly associated more CIN and renal function decline compared to low activin A tertile (all p < 0.001). After adjusting potential confounding factors, high serum activin A tertiles was associated to CIN (Odds ratio 4.49, 95% CI 1.07–18.86, p = 0.040) and renal function decline (Hazard ratio 4.49, 95% CI 1.27–11.41, p = 0.017) after CAG."
"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a fatal disease. Its development encompasses a complex interplay between hemodynamic stimuli on and changes in the arterial wall. Currently available biomarkers fail to predict the risk of AAA rupture independent of aneurysm size. Therefore, novel biomarkers for AAA characterization are needed. In this study, we used a mouse model of AAA to investigate the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an albumin-binding probe to assess changes in vascular permeability at different stages of aneurysm growth. Two imaging studies were performed: a longitudinal study with follow-up and death as endpoint to predict rupture risk and a week-by-week study to characterize AAA development. AAAs, which eventually ruptured, demonstrated a significantly higher in vivo MR signal enhancement from the albumin-binding probe (p = 0.047) and a smaller nonenhancing thrombus area compared to intact AAAs (p = 0.001). The ratio of albumin-binding-probe enhancement of the aneurysm wall to size of nonenhancing-thrombus-area predicted AAA rupture with high sensitivity/specificity (100%/86%). More advanced aneurysms with higher vascular permeability demonstrated an increased uptake of the albumin-binding-probe. These results indicate that MRI with an albumin-binding probe may enable noninvasive assessment of vascular permeability in murine AAAs and prediction of rupture risk."
"Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately one-third of the total global cancer incidence and mortality. Historically, the mechanisms of tumour initiation and progression in the gastrointestinal tract have been studied using cancer cell lines in vitro and animal models. Traditional cell culture methods are associated with a strong selection of aberrant genomic variants that no longer reflect the original tumours in terms of their (metastatic) behaviour or response to therapy. Organoid technology has emerged as a powerful alternative method for culturing gastrointestinal tumours and the corresponding normal tissues in a manner that preserves their genetic, phenotypic and behavioural traits. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that organoid cultures have great value in predicting the outcome of therapy in individual patients. Herein, we review the current literature on organoid models of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer, and their value in modelling tumour initiation, metastatic progression and therapy response. We also explore the limitations of current organoid models and discuss how they could be improved to maximally benefit basic and translational research in the future, especially in the fields of drug discovery and personalized medicine."
"Conventional next generation sequencing analysis has provided important insights into cancer genetics. However, the detection of rare (low allele fraction) variants remains difficult because of the error-prone nucleotide changes derived from sequencing/PCR errors. To eliminate the false-positive variants and detect genuine rare variants, sequencing technology combined with molecular barcodes will be useful. Here, we used the newly developed dual-molecular barcode technology (Ion AmpliSeq HD) to analyze somatic mutations in 24 samples (12 tumor tissues and 12 plasma) from 12 patients with biliary-pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. We compared the results between next generation sequencing analysis with or without molecular barcode technologies. The variant allele fraction (VAF) between non-molecular barcode and molecular barcode sequencing was correlated in plasma DNA (R2 = 0.956) and tumor (R2 = 0.935). Both methods successfully detected high VAF mutations, however, rare variants were only identified by molecular barcode sequencing and not by non-molecular barcode sequencing. Some of these rare variants in tumors were annotated as pathogenic, and therefore subclonal driver mutations could be observed. Furthermore, the very low VAF down to 0.17% were identified in cell free DNA in plasma. These results demonstrate that the dual molecular barcode sequencing technologies can sensitively detect rare somatic mutations, and will be important in the investigation of the clonal and subclonal architectures of tumor heterogeneity."
"The role of subcellular survivin compartmentalization in the biology and prognosis of prostate cancer is unclear. We therefore investigated subcellular localization of survivin in more than 3000 prostate cancer patients by quantitative immunohistochemistry and performed transcriptomics of 250 prostate cancer patients and healthy donors using publicly available datasets. Survivin (BIRC5) gene expression was increased in primary prostate cancers and metastases, but did not differ in recurrent vs non-recurrent prostate cancers. Survivin immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was limited exclusively to the nucleus in 900 prostate cancers (40.0%), and accompanied by various levels of cytoplasmic positivity in 1338 tumors (59.4%). 0.5% of prostate cancers did not express survivin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin staining intensities were strongly associated with each other, pT category, and higher Gleason scores. Cytoplasmic but not nuclear survivin staining correlated with high tumor cell proliferation in prostate cancers. Strong cytoplasmic survivin staining, but not nuclear staining predicted an unfavorable outcome in univariate analyses. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that survivin is not an independent prognostic marker. In conclusion, we provide evidence that survivin expression is increased in prostate cancers, especially in metastatic disease, resulting in higher aggressiveness and tumor progression. In addition, subcellular compartmentalization is an important aspect of survivin cancer biology, as only cytoplasmic, but not nuclear survivin accumulation is linked to biological aggressiveness and prognosis of prostate cancers."
"Next generation sequencing has disrupted genetic testing, allowing far more scope in the tests applied. The appropriate sections of the genome to be tested can now be readily selected, from single mutations to whole-genome sequencing. One product offering within this spectrum are focused exomes, targeting ~5,000 genes know to be implicated in human disease. These are designed to offer a flexible platform offering high diagnostic yield with a reduction in sequencing requirement compared to whole exome sequencing. Here, we have undertaken sequencing of control DNA samples and compare two kits, the Illumina TruSight One and the Agilent SureSelect Focused Exome. Characteristics of the kits are comprehensively evaluated. Despite the larger design region of the Agilent kit, we find that the Illumina kit performs better in terms of gene coverage, as well as coverage of clinically relevant loci. We provide exhaustive coverage statistics for each kit to aid the assessment of their suitability and provide read data for control DNA samples to allow for bioinformatic benchmarking by users developing pipelines for these data."
"We developed a hybrid deep learning model (HDLM) algorithm that quantitatively predicts macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thickness from red-free retinal nerve fiber layer photographs (RNFLPs). A total of 789 pairs of RNFLPs and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans for 431 eyes of 259 participants (183 eyes of 114 healthy controls, 68 eyes of 46 glaucoma suspects, and 180 eyes of 99 glaucoma patients) were enrolled. An HDLM was built by combining a pre-trained deep learning network and support vector machine. The correlation coefficient and mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted and measured mGCIPL thicknesses were calculated. The measured (OCT-based) and predicted (HDLM-based) average mGCIPL thicknesses were 73.96 ± 8.81 µm and 73.92 ± 7.36 µm, respectively (P = 0.844). The predicted mGCIPL thickness showed a strong correlation and good agreement with the measured mGCIPL thickness (Correlation coefficient r = 0.739; P < 0.001; MAE = 4.76 µm). Even when the peripapillary area (diameter: 1.5 disc diameters) was masked, the correlation (r = 0.713; P < 0.001) and agreement (MAE = 4.87 µm) were not changed significantly (P = 0.378 and 0.724, respectively). The trained HDLM algorithm showed a great capability for mGCIPL thickness prediction from RNFLPs."
"Pure intravascular growth of epithelioid hemangioma (EH) is exceptional. Herein, we report a series of 21 intravascular EHs, representing a potential serious diagnostic pitfall by mimicking malignant vascular neoplsms with epithelioid morphology. The tumors developed in 12 males and 4 females, aged from 11 to 71 years (mean age 40.2 years) with a predilection for the extremities (13 of 21, 61.9%), followed by the head and neck (8 of 21, 38.1%). Lesions ranged in size from 2 to 30 mm (mean size 13 mm). The most common presenting feature was a slowly growing nodule. Most neoplasms were solitary (13 of 16 patients, 81.2%) but three patients developed more than one intravascular EH (3 of 16, 18.8%). Treatment consisted of complete surgical excision and was generally curative. Follow-up was available for 13 lesions that had developed in ten patients (range 4–72 months, mean 27.3 months). No recurrences or development of additional tumors were observed. All 21 lesions developed in subcutaneous veins. Two morphological patterns of intravascular epithelioid endothelial cell proliferation were observed: (1) a lobular capillary hemangioma-like proliferation with variable formation of open vascular lumina and (2) a solid proliferation generally lacking open vascular spaces. A lobular capillary hemangioma-like pattern was the sole pattern in nine lesions, a mixed lobular hemangioma-like pattern, and solid pattern in eight and a pure solid pattern in four intravascular EHs. Mitotic activity in epithelioid endothelial cells ranged from 0 to 7 mitoses per 10 high-power field (mean 2.1 mitoses per 10 HPFs). Six lesions displayed brisk mitotic activity of five or more mitoses per 10 HPF (6 of 21, 28.5%). The number of mitoses was usually more prominent in areas with solid growth. Atypical mitoses were not observed. No intratumoral necroses were seen. Cytological atypia was mild (20 out of 21 cases). By immunohistochemistry, all tumors were positive for CD31 (14 out of 14) and ERG (5 out of 5). While all tested cases were FOS negative by immunohistochemistry (6 out of 6), one out of six cases (case 6) displayed FOSB nuclear positivity in about 30% of the lesional endothelial cells. Eight cases were analysed by FISH for the presence of FOS and FOSB gene rearrangements. While all cases were negative for FOSB rearrangements, a single case proved positive for FOS gene break-apart. In conclusion, intravascular growth of EH is not associated with adverse biological behavior. Solid intravascular proliferations of endothelial cells can mimic a malignant vascular tumor with epithelioid morphology. Nevertheless, intravascular EHs display mild cytological atypia coupled with low mitotic activity, and a lack of atypical mitoses, pronounced nuclear atypia, multilayering or tumor necrosis. Finally, the FOS gene is infrequently rearranged, and there are no FOSB gene abnormalities in this subset of EHs, suggesting a potential distinct pathogenesis than most classic EHs."
"Epigenetic deregulation remarkably triggers mechanisms associated with tumor aggressiveness like epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Since EMT is a highly complex, but also reversible event, epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation or chromatin alterations must be involved in its regulation. It was recently described that loss of the cell cycle regulator p21 was associated with a gain in EMT characteristics and an upregulation of the master EMT transcription factor ZEB1. In this study, in silico analysis was performed in combination with different in vitro and in vivo techniques to identify and verify novel epigenetic targets of ZEB1, and to proof the direct transcriptional regulation of SETD1B by ZEB1. The chorioallantoic-membrane assay served as an in vivo model to analyze the ZEB1/SETD1B interaction. Bioinformatical analysis of CRC patient data was used to examine the ZEB1/SETD1B network under clinical conditions and the ZEB1/SETD1B network was modeled under physiological and pathological conditions. Thus, we identified a self-reinforcing loop for ZEB1 expression and found that the SETD1B associated active chromatin mark H3K4me3 was enriched at the ZEB1 promoter in EMT cells. Moreover, clinical evaluation of CRC patient data showed that the simultaneous high expression of ZEB1 and SETD1B was correlated with the worst prognosis. Here we report that the expression of chromatin modifiers is remarkably dysregulated in EMT cells. SETD1B was identified as a new ZEB1 target in vitro and in vivo. Our study demonstrates a novel example of an activator role of ZEB1 for the epigenetic landscape in colorectal tumor cells."
"Histone demethylase JMJD2D can promote gene expression by specifically demethylating H3K9me2/3. The role of JMJD2D in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remains unclear. Here, we show that colonic JMJD2D is induced by TNFα during dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. JMJD2D-deficient mice exhibit more severe colon damage and defective colon regeneration due to impaired Hedgehog signaling activation after colitis. JMJD2D knockdown in CRC cells suppresses Hedgehog signaling, resulting in reduced CRC growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, JMJD2D promotes Hedgehog target gene expression through interacting with Gli2 to reduce H3K9me3 levels at the promoter. Clinically, JMJD2D expression is upregulated and positively correlated with Gli2 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease specimens and CRC specimens. The JMJD2D inhibitor 5-c-8HQ or aspirin synergizes with Hedgehog inhibitor vismodegib to inhibit CRC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings unveil an essential role of JMJD2D in activating the processes of colonic protection, regeneration, and tumorigenesis."
"Transmembrane protein 30A (TMEM30A) maintains the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylserine, an integral component of the cell membrane and ‘eat-me’ signal recognized by macrophages. Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the British Columbia population-based registry uncovered recurrent biallelic TMEM30A loss-of-function mutations, which were associated with a favorable outcome and uniquely observed in DLBCL. Using TMEM30A-knockout systems, increased accumulation of chemotherapy drugs was observed in TMEM30A-knockout cell lines and TMEM30A-mutated primary cells, explaining the improved treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found increased tumor-associated macrophages and an enhanced effect of anti-CD47 blockade limiting tumor growth in TMEM30A-knockout models. By contrast, we show that TMEM30A loss-of-function increases B-cell signaling following antigen stimulation—a mechanism conferring selective advantage during B-cell lymphoma development. Our data highlight a multifaceted role for TMEM30A in B-cell lymphomagenesis, and characterize intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be therapeutically exploited."
"Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ syndrome (APDS) is an autosomal-dominant combined immunodeficiency disorder resulting from pathogenic gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the PIK3CD gene. Patients with APDS display abnormal T cell homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which PIK3CD GOF contributes to this feature remain unknown. Here, with a cohort of children with PIK3CD GOF mutations from multiple regions of China and a corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited mouse model, we reported that hyperactive PI3Kδ disrupted TNaive cell homeostasis in the periphery by intrinsically promoting the growth, proliferation, and activation of TNaive cells. Our results showed that PIK3CD GOF resulted in loss of the quiescence-associated gene expression profile in naive T cells and promoted naive T cells to overgrow, hyperproliferate and acquire an activated functional status. Naive PIK3CD GOF T cells exhibited an enhanced glycolytic capacity and reduced mitochondrial respiration in the resting or activated state. Blocking glycolysis abrogated the abnormal splenic T cell pool and reversed the overactivated phenotype induced by PIK3CD GOF in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that enhanced aerobic glycolysis is required for PIK3CD GOF-induced overactivation of naive T cells and provide a potential therapeutic approach for targeting glycolysis to treat patients with APDS as well as other immune disorders."
"This study compared mortality rates and decline in life expectancy of Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with the general population. A retrospective study of 2451 patients with T2DM was conducted in the Isfahan Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Iran, between 1992 and 2010. The mean (SD) of diabetes duration and median (Q1,Q3) of follow-up period were 15.5(8.0) and 8(5, 10) years. The main outcome was all-cause mortality. 732(29.87%) of patients died during the follow-up. Overall mortality rates (95%CI) per 1000 person-years in men and women were 56.3(52.0–62.1) and 27.3(24.5–30.4), respectively. The relative risks (95%CI) of all-cause mortality in males vs. females with T2DM aged 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74 were [3.02(1.49–6.11) vs. 2.09(0.96–4.57)], [4.05(2.73–6.01) vs. 2.29(1.52–3.45)], [4.13(3.26–5.24) vs. 1.70(1.23–2.35)], [2.42(1.90–3.07) vs. 1.82(1.46–2.27)], [2.36(2.02–2.76) vs. 1.49(1.25–1.78)] and [1.71(1.50–1.95) vs. 1.04(0.88–1.23)] times more than the general population, respectively. Men and women living with diabetes lost an average of 13.2(6.3) and 13.9(6.0) life-years from the year of diagnosis, respectively (p = 0.101). The estimated life-years lost were greater in younger patients and a gradual decline was observed with increasing the age at diagnosis. In conclusion, Iranians with diabetes had higher risk of death and lower life expectancy compared to the general population."
"ObjectivesThis study aims to evaluate the impact of hospital setting on outcomes for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome.Study designWe conducted a retrospective study in two hospitals and three different hospital units. The inpatient group (n = 60) was managed on general inpatient floors, the NICU group (n = 50) was managed primarily in an NICU, and the combination group (n = 49) was managed in both NICU and inpatient units. The primary outcome was length of stay. Secondary outcomes included breastfeeding rates, morphine usage rates, and hospital costs.ResultsThe length of stay in the inpatient group (8.5 days) was significantly lower than the combination group (18 days) and NICU group (23 days) (p < 0.01). The inpatient group had significantly lower rates of morphine treatment and hospital costs with no difference in breastfeeding rates.ConclusionsInfants with neonatal abstinence syndrome had a significantly shorter length of stay and less use of morphine when managed on inpatient units versus NICU."
"Photoreceptor loss is a leading cause of blindness, but mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration are not well understood. Treatment strategies would benefit from improved understanding of gene-expression patterns directing photoreceptor development, as many genes are implicated in both development and degeneration. Neural retina leucine zipper (NRL) is critical for rod photoreceptor genesis and degeneration, with NRL mutations known to cause enhanced S-cone syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa. While murine Nrl loss has been characterized, studies of human NRL can identify important insights for human retinal development and disease. We utilized iPSC organoid models of retinal development to molecularly define developmental alterations in a human model of NRL loss. Consistent with the function of NRL in rod fate specification, human retinal organoids lacking NRL develop S-opsin dominant photoreceptor populations. We report generation of two distinct S-opsin expressing populations in NRL null retinal organoids and identify MEF2C as a candidate regulator of cone development."
"In current treatment plans of intensity-modulated proton therapy, high-energy beams are usually assigned larger weights than low-energy beams. Using this form of beam delivery strategy cannot effectively use the biological advantages of low-energy and high-linear energy transfer (LET) protons present within the Bragg peak. However, the planning optimizer can be adjusted to alter the intensity of each beamlet, thus maintaining an identical target dose while increasing the weights of low-energy beams to elevate the LET therein. The objective of this study was to experimentally validate the enhanced biological effects using a novel beam delivery strategy with elevated LET. We used Monte Carlo and optimization algorithms to generate two different intensity-modulation patterns, namely to form a downslope and a flat dose field in the target. We spatially mapped the biological effects using high-content automated assays by employing an upgraded biophysical system with improved accuracy and precision of collected data. In vitro results in cancer cells show that using two opposed downslope fields results in a more biologically effective dose, which may have the clinical potential to increase the therapeutic index of proton therapy."
"An increasingly comprehension of the folding intermediate states of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) is currently an important scientific challenge, especially for the human telomeric (h-tel) G4s-forming sequences, characterized by a highly polymorphic nature. Despite the G-triplex conformation was proposed as one of the possible folding intermediates for the antiparallel and hybrid h-tel G4s, for the parallel h-tel topology with an all-anti guanine orientation, a vertical strand-slippage involving the G-triplets was proposed in previous works through microseconds-long standard molecular dynamics simulations (MDs). Here, in order to get further insights into the vertical strand-slippage and the folding intermediate states of the parallel h-tel G4s, we have carried out a Well-Tempered Metadynamics simulation (WT-MetaD), which allowed us to retrieve an ensemble of six G4s having two/G-tetrad conformations derived by the G-triplets vertical slippage. The insights highlighted in this work are aimed at rationalizing the mechanistic characterisation of the parallel h-tel G4 folding process."
"H7 avian influenza viruses represent a major public health concern, and worldwide outbreaks raise the risk of a potential pandemic. Understanding the memory B cell response to avian (H7) influenza virus infection in humans could provide insights in the potential key to human infection risks. We investigated an epizootic of the highly pathogenic A(H7N7) in the Netherlands, which in 2003 led to infection of 89 persons and one fatal case. Subtype-specificity of antibodies were determined for confirmed H7N7 infected individuals (cases) (n = 19), contacts of these cases (n = 21) and a comparison group controls (n = 16), by microarray, using recombinant hemagglutinin (HA)1 proteins. The frequency and specificity of memory B cells was determined by detecting subtype-specific antibodies in the culture supernatants from in vitro stimulated oligoclonal B cell cultures, from peripheral blood of cases and controls. All cases (100%) had high antibody titers specific for A(H7N7)2003 (GMT > 100), whereas H7-HA1 antigen binding was detected in 29% of contacts and 31% of controls, suggesting that some of the H7 reactivity stems from cross reactive antibodies. To unravel homotypic and heterotypic responses, the frequency and specificity of memory B cells were determined in 2 cases. Ten of 123 HA1 reactive clones isolated from the cases bound to only H7- HA1, whereas 5 bound both H7 and other HA1 antigens. We recovered at least four different epitopal reactivities, though none of the H7 reactive antibodies were able to neutralize H7 infections in vitro. Our study serologically confirms the infection with H7 avian influenza viruses, and shows that H7 infection triggers a mixture of strain -specific and cross-reactive antibodies."
"Incineration is a solution to waste problems; however, it has adverse effects on human health. Our study aimed to investigate the direct and indirect effects of living near an incinerator and breastfeeding on children’s development at 6, 18, 36 and 66 months, and 8 years of age. The Taiwan Birth Cohort Study dataset used included randomized community data on 19,519 children from 6 months to 8 years old. The Taiwan Birth Cohort Study Developmental Instrument was used to measure children’s development at different developmental ages. The results of our study showed that living within 3 km of an incinerator had a negative effect on children’s 6-month development, however the effect dissipated after 18 months. Having been breastfed and living in the city had a more persistent and pervasive positive effect on children’s development. Conversely, living in the city had an adverse effect on children’s social-communication and emotional development when they were 8 years old; possibly due to the Chinese cultural characteristic of collectivism. Further follow-up of the long-term interactive effects of proximity to an incinerator and breastfeeding on children’s development and health is needed."
"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome B; OMIM 252920), is a lysosomal storage disease with progressive neurological signs caused by deficient activity of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU, EC 3.2.1.50). Herein we report the causative variant in the NAGLU gene in Schipperke dogs and a genotyping survey in the breed. All six exons and adjacent regions of the NAGLU gene were sequenced from six healthy appearing and three affected Schipperkes. DNA fragment length and TaqMan assays were used to genotype privately owned Schipperkes. A single variant was found in exon 6 of MPS IIIB affected Schipperkes: an insertion consisting of a 40–70 bp poly-A and an 11 bp duplication of the exonic region preceding the poly-A (XM_548088.6:c.2110_2111ins[A(40_70);2100_2110]) is predicted to insert a stretch of 13 or more lysines followed by either an in-frame insertion of a repeat of the four amino acids preceding the lysines, or a frameshift. The clinically affected Schipperkes were homozygous for this insertion, and the sequenced healthy dogs were either heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. From 2003–2019, 3219 Schipperkes were genotyped. Of these, 1.5% were homozygous for this insertion and found to be clinically affected, and 23.6% were heterozygous for the insertion and were clinically healthy, the remaining 74.9% were homozygous for the wild-type and were also clinically healthy. The number of dogs homozygous and heterozygous for the insertion declined rapidly after the initial years of genotyping, documenting the benefit of a DNA screening program in a breed with a small gene pool. In conclusion, a causative NAGLU variant in Schipperke dogs with MPS IIIB was identified and was found at high frequency in the breed. Through genotyping and informed breeding practices, the prevalence of canine MPS IIIB has been drastically reduced in the Schipperke population worldwide."
"5’-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an important 5’-cytosine modification, is altered highly in order in male meiotic prophase. However, the regulatory mechanism of this dynamic change and the function of 5hmC in meiosis remain largely unknown. Using a knockout mouse model, we showed that UHRF1 regulated male meiosis. UHRF1 deficiency led to failure of meiosis and male infertility. Mechanistically, the deficiency of UHRF1 altered significantly the meiotic gene profile of spermatocytes. Uhrf1 knockout induced an increase of the global 5hmC level. The enrichment of hyper-5hmC at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) was highly associated with gene downregulation. In addition, the elevated level of the TET1 enzyme might have contributed to the higher 5hmC level in the Uhrf1 knockout spermatocytes. Finally, we reported Uhrf1, a key gene in male meiosis, repressed hyper-5hmC by downregulating TET1. Furthermore, UHRF1 facilitated RNA polymerase II (RNA-pol2) loading to promote gene transcription. Thus our study demonstrated a potential regulatory mechanism of 5hmC dynamic change and its involvement in epigenetic regulation in male meiosis."
"Limited clinical activity has been seen in osteosarcoma (OS) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). To gain insights into the immunogenic potential of these tumors, we conducted whole genome, RNA, and T-cell receptor sequencing, immunohistochemistry and reverse phase protein array profiling (RPPA) on OS specimens from 48 pediatric and adult patients with primary, relapsed, and metastatic OS. Median immune infiltrate level was lower than in other tumor types where ICI are effective, with concomitant low T-cell receptor clonalities. Neoantigen expression in OS was lacking and significantly associated with high levels of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Samples with low immune infiltrate had higher number of deleted genes while those with high immune infiltrate expressed higher levels of adaptive resistance pathways. PARP2 expression levels were significantly negatively associated with the immune infiltrate. Together, these data reveal multiple immunosuppressive features of OS and suggest immunotherapeutic opportunities in OS patients."
"The practice of radical prostatectomy for treating prostate cancer has evolved remarkably since its general introduction around 1900. Initially described using a perineal approach, the procedure was later popularized using a retropubic one, after it was first described as such in 1948. The open surgical method has now largely been abandoned in favour of the minimally invasive robot-assisted method, which was first described in 2000. Until 1980, the procedure was hazardous, often accompanied by massive blood loss and poor outcomes. For patients in whom surgery is indicated, prostatectomy is increasingly being used as the first step in a multitherapeutic approach in advanced local, and even early metastatic, disease. However, contemporary molecular insights have enabled many men to safely avoid surgical intervention when the disease is phenotypically indolent and use of active surveillance programmes continues to expand worldwide. In 2020, surgery is not recommended in those men with low-grade, low-volume Gleason 6 prostate cancer; previously these men — a large cohort of ~40% of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer — were offered surgery in large numbers, with little clinical benefit and considerable adverse effects. Radical prostatectomy is appropriate for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease (Gleason score 7–9 or Grade Groups 2–5) in whom radical prostatectomy prevents further metastatic seeding of potentially lethal clones of prostate cancer cells. Small series have suggested that it might be appropriate to offer radical prostatectomy to men presenting with small metastatic burden (nodal and or bone) as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. Furthermore, surgical treatment of prostate cancer has been reported in cohorts of octogenarian men in good health with minimal comorbidities, when 20 years ago such men were rarely treated surgically even when diagnosed with localized high-risk disease. As medical therapies for prostate cancer continue to increase, the use of surgery might seem to be less relevant; however, the changing demographics of prostate cancer means that radical prostatectomy remains an important and useful option in many men, with a changing indication."
"Over the past several decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC; in patients <50 years old) has increased at an alarming rate. Although robust and scientifically rigorous epidemiological studies have sifted out environmental elements linked to EOCRC, our knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of this disease is far from complete. Here, we highlight potential risk factors and putative mechanisms that drive EOCRC and suggest likely areas for fruitful research. In addition, we identify inconsistencies in the evidence implicating a strong effect of increased adiposity and suggest that certain behaviours (such as diet and stress) might place nonobese and otherwise healthy people at risk of this disease. Key risk factors are reviewed, including the global westernization of diets (usually involving a high intake of red and processed meats, high-fructose corn syrup and unhealthy cooking methods), stress, antibiotics, synthetic food dyes, monosodium glutamate, titanium dioxide, and physical inactivity and/or sedentary behaviour. The gut microbiota is probably at the crossroads of these risk factors and EOCRC. The time course of the disease and the fact that relevant exposures probably occur in childhood raise important methodological issues that are also discussed."
"BackgroundCancer peptide vaccines show only marginal effects against cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show significant curative effects in certain types of cancers, but the response rate is still limited. In this study, we aim to improve cancer peptide vaccination by targeting Ag peptides selectively to a dendritic cell (DC) subset, XCR1-expressing DCs (XCR1+ DCs), with high ability to support CD8+ T-cell responses.MethodsWe have generated a fusion protein, consisting of an Ag peptide presented with MHC class I, and an XCR1 ligand, XCL1, and examined its effects on antitumour immunity in mice.ResultsThe fusion protein was delivered to XCR1+ DCs in an XCR1-dependent manner. Immunisation with the fusion protein plus an immune adjuvant, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acids (poly(I:C)), more potently induced Ag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses through XCR1 than the Ag peptide plus poly(I:C) or the Ag protein plus poly(I:C). The fusion protein plus poly(I:C) inhibited the tumour growth efficiently in the prophylactic and therapeutic tumour models. Furthermore, the fusion protein plus poly(I:C) showed suppressive effects on tumour growth in synergy with anti-PD-1 Ab.ConclusionsCancer Ag targeting to XCR1+ DCs should be a promising procedure as a combination anticancer therapy with immune checkpoint blockade."
"IntroductionThe omic approach can help identify a signature that can be potentially used as biomarkers in babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).ObjectivesTo find a specific microRNA (miR) and metabolic fingerprint of the tracheal aspirates (TA) of CDH patients. We conducted a genetic analysis from blood samples.MethodsTA samples collected in the first 48 h of life in patients with CDH, compared with age-matched controls. Metabolomics done by a mass spectroscopy-based assay. Genomics done using chromosomal microarray analysis.ResultsCDH (n = 17) and 16 control neonates enrolled. miR-16, miR-17, miR-18, miR-19b, and miR-20a had an increased expression, while miR-19a had a twofold decreased expression in CDH patients, compared with age-matched control patients. Specific metabolites separated neonates with CDH from controls. A genetic mutation found in a small subset of patients.ConclusionsSpecific patterns of metabolites and miR expression can be discerned in TA samples in infants with CDH."
"Psoriasis is a common autoimmune and chronic inflammatory skin disorder globally affecting 0.51–11.43% of adults. Inflammation-associated cell death in keratinocytes plays a key role in the process of integrate inflammatory cascade in psoriasis. Necroptosis is a regulated necrotic cell death mediated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), which participates in many human inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism and function of programmed necrosis in psoriasis is not well-illustrated. In the current study, we provide evidence for the involvement of necroptosis in psoriasis. RIPK1 and MLKL were significantly upregulated and localized in all layers of the epidermis in human psoriatic lesions, while RIPK3 and phosphorylated MLKL were mainly expressed in keratinocytes, which located in the upper layers. Increased tendency of necroptosis was also found in IMQ-induced psoriasiform skin of mice. Further, we discovered that both the inhibitor of RIPK1 R-7-Cl-O-Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1s) and MLKL-inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) suppressed necroptosis in HaCaT cells and IMQ mouse models, powerfully blocked IMQ-induced inflammatory responses in vivo, and significantly downregulated the production of inflammatory factors like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23a, CXCL1, and CCL20. These findings promote the development of new therapies for the treatment of necroptosis-activated pathologies for psoriasis."
"Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) can be susceptible, at least transiently, to treatments with azidothymidine (AZT) plus IFNα and/or arsenic trioxide. However, the real role of AZT in this effect is still unclear. In fact, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition could explain reduction of clonal expansion and of renewal of HTLV-1 infected cells during ATL progression, this effect alone seems insufficient to justify the evident and prompt decrease of the pro-viral load in treated patients. We have previously demonstrated that AZT is endowed with an intrinsic pro-apoptotic potential towards both peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors or some tumor cell lines, but this cytotoxic potential cannot be fully achieved unless IκBα phosphorylation is inhibited. Since the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B (NF-κB) appears a common biological basis of HTLV-1-infected cells, a pharmacological inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation seems a potential strategy for treating and preventing HTLV-1 related pathologies. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination treatment with the IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor Bay 11-7085 and AZT induced increased levels of regulated cell death (RCD) by apoptosis compared to the single treatments in HTLV-1 infected cells of different origin. Importantly, levels of RCD were considerably higher in infected cells in comparison with the uninfected ones. Inhibition of NF-κB activation following the combined treatment was confirmed by analysis of both gel-shift and functional activity of the NF-κB complex proteins, p65/p52. Moreover, a transcriptional analysis revealed that the addition of Bay 11-7085 to AZT treatment in HTLV-1-infected cells modified their transcriptional profile, by inducing the upregulation of some pro-apoptotic genes together with the downregulation of some anti-apoptotic genes. Our data suggest that addition of adequate concentrations of IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor to therapeutic regimens including AZT could be a promising strategy in ATL."
"Several proteins and peptides in saliva were shown to stimulate gingival wound repair, but the role of salivary metabolites in this process remains unexplored. In vitro gingival re-epithelialization kinetics were determined using unstimulated saliva samples from healthy individuals collected during an experimental gingivitis study. Elastic net regression with stability selection identified a specific metabolite signature in a training dataset that was associated with the observed re-epithelialization kinetics and enabled its prediction for all saliva samples obtained in the clinical study. This signature encompassed ten metabolites, including plasmalogens, diacylglycerol and amino acid derivatives, which reflect enhanced host-microbe interactions. This association is in agreement with the positive correlation of the metabolite signature with the individual’s gingival bleeding index. Remarkably, intra-individual signature-variation over time was associated with elevated risk for gingivitis development. Unravelling how these metabolites stimulate wound repair could provide novel avenues towards therapeutic approaches in patients with impaired wound healing capacity."
"Data on outcome in older (≥70 years) patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia after treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) compared with standard chemotherapy (CTX) is scarce. We evaluated 433 patients (median age, 73.4 years) treated either with ATO+ all-trans retinoic acid (ATO/ATRA; n = 26), CTX/ATRA + ATO during consolidation (CTX/ATRA/ATO; n = 148), or with CTX/ATRA (n = 259). Median follow-up for overall survival (OS) was 4.8 years. Complete remissions (CR) were achieved in 92% with ATO/ATRA and 82% with CTX/ATRA; induction death rates were 8% and 18%, respectively. For analysis of postremission outcomes we combined the ATO/ATRA and CTX/ATRA/ATO groups (ATO/ATRA ± CTX). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was significantly lower after ATO/ATRA ± CTX compared with CTX/ATRA (P < 0.001). The same held true when restricting the analysis according to the treatment period after the year 2000. OS of patients in CR1 was not different between ATO/ATRA ± CTX compared with CTX/ATRA (P = 0.20). High (>10 × 109/l) white blood cell (WBC) counts at diagnosis were associated with higher CIR (P < 0.001) compared with lower WBC in the CTX/ATRA group, but not in the ATO/ATRA ± CTX group (P = 0.48). ATO, when added to ATRA or CTX/ATRA is feasible and effective in elderly patients for remission induction and consolidation, particularly in patients with high WBC at diagnosis."
"The ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on X chromosome (UTX) is a major histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins are the H3K4 methyltransferases. UTX is one of the major components of MLL3- and MLL4-containing (MlLL3/4) complexes and likely has functions within the complexes. Although UTX is frequently mutated in various types of cancer and is thought to play a crucial role as a tumor suppressor, the importance of UTX interaction with MLL3/4 complexes in cancer formation is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the ability of cancer-derived UTX mutant proteins to interact with ASH2L, which is a common core component of all the MLL complexes, and MLL3/4-specific components PTIP and PA1, and found that several single-amino acid substitution mutations in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) affect UTX interaction with these components. Interaction-compromised mutants G137V and D336G and a TPR-deleted mutant Δ80-397 were preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that UTX is retained in the nucleus by MLL3/4 complexes through their interaction with the TPR. Intriguingly, WT UTX suppressed colony formation in soft agar, whereas G137V failed. This suggests that interaction of UTX with MLL3/4 complex plays a crucial role in their tumor suppressor function. Preferential cytoplasmic localization was also observed for endogenous proteins of G137V and another mutant G137VΔ138 in HCT116 created by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Interestingly, expression levels of these mutants were low and MG312 stabilized both endogenous as well as exogenous G137V proteins. These results reveal a novel mechanism of UTX regulation and reinforce the importance of UTX interaction with MLL3/4 complexes in cancer formation."
"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate inflammation and immunity in mammalian tissues1,2. Although ILC2s are found in cancers of these tissues3, their roles in cancer immunity and immunotherapy are unclear. Here we show that ILC2s infiltrate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) to activate tissue-specific tumour immunity. Interleukin-33 (IL33) activates tumour ILC2s (TILC2s) and CD8+ T cells in orthotopic pancreatic tumours but not heterotopic skin tumours in mice to restrict pancreas-specific tumour growth. Resting and activated TILC2s express the inhibitory checkpoint receptor PD-1. Antibody-mediated PD-1 blockade relieves ILC2 cell-intrinsic PD-1 inhibition to expand TILC2s, augment anti-tumour immunity, and enhance tumour control, identifying activated TILC2s as targets of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, both PD-1+ TILC2s and PD-1+ T cells are present in most human PDACs. Our results identify ILC2s as anti-cancer immune cells for PDAC immunotherapy. More broadly, ILC2s emerge as tissue-specific enhancers of cancer immunity that amplify the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. As ILC2s and T cells co-exist in human cancers and share stimulatory and inhibitory pathways, immunotherapeutic strategies to collectively target anti-cancer ILC2s and T cells may be broadly applicable."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) expressing stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs) endowed with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity and putatively recognizing the HCV E2 protein. To further untangle the shaping and function of these BCRs, we analyzed immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of monoclonal B cells from 13 patients with HCV-associated LPDs and correlated their features with the clinical outcomes of antiviral therapy. While only two patients shared a stereotyped heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) sequence, two kappa chain CDR3 stereotyped sequences accounted for 77% of BCRs. Light chains were enriched in sequences homologous to anti-HCV E2 antibodies compared with heavy chains (7/13 vs. 0/13; p = 0.005). Anti-HCV E2 homology was uniquely associated (7/7 vs. 0/6; p = 0.0006) with a stereotyped CDR3 sequence encoded by IGKV3-20/3D-20 gene(s) accounting for 54% of BCRs. An IGKV3-15/IGKJ1-encoded stereotyped sequence homologous to WA RF accounted for 23% of BCRs. LPDs expressing KCDR3s homologous to anti-HCV E2 antibodies responded more frequently to the eradication of HCV by antiviral therapy (6/6 vs. 1/6; p = 0.015). These findings, although limited by the small sample size, suggest that a stereotyped KCDR3 may predominantly shape anti-HCV specificity of BCRs, possibly providing a signature that may help identifying bona fide HCV-dependent LPDs."
"We sought to characterized patterns of aPL testing in a large general population sample from the United States. Using Truven Health MarketScan laboratory data from 2010–2015 we identified individuals tested for lupus anticoagulant(LA), anti-cardiolipin (aCL), and anti-beta2-glycoprotein1(aGP1). Our research was approved by the McGill institutional review board (A04-M47-12B). We identified 33,456 individuals with at least one aPL test. Among these, only 6,391 (19%) had all three tests (LA, aCL, aGP1) performed. Confirmatory aPL testing was performed at least 12 weeks later in 77%, 45%, and 41% of initially positive LA, aCL, and aGP1, respectively. Of those re-tested after ≥12 weeks, only 255 (10.6%) were found to have a confirmatory positive aPL test. These findings highlight that aPL testing may often be incompletely performed. Further investigations will be required to better understand the low rate of a confirmatory positive aPL test ≥12 weeks after the initial test."
"Cyclic cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a pattern recognition cytosolic DNA sensor that is essential for cellular senescence. cGAS promotes inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) through recognizing cytoplasmic chromatin during senescence. cGAS-mediated inflammation is essential for the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade. However, the mechanism by which cGAS recognizes cytoplasmic chromatin is unknown. Here we show that topoisomerase 1-DNA covalent cleavage complex (TOP1cc) is both necessary and sufficient for cGAS-mediated cytoplasmic chromatin recognition and SASP during senescence. TOP1cc localizes to cytoplasmic chromatin and TOP1 interacts with cGAS to enhance the binding of cGAS to DNA. Retention of TOP1cc to cytoplasmic chromatin depends on its stabilization by the chromatin architecture protein HMGB2. Functionally, the HMGB2-TOP1cc-cGAS axis determines the response of orthotopically transplanted ex vivo therapy-induced senescent cells to immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. Together, these findings establish a HMGB2-TOP1cc-cGAS axis that enables cytoplasmic chromatin recognition and response to immune checkpoint blockade."
"ObjectivesTo examine the racial differences in the population attributable fraction (PAF) of prepregnancy obesity and excessive gestational weight gain to large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates.MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study among all women who had prenatal screening and had a singleton live birth in a hospital (1 April 2016–31 March 2017) using data from Ontario birth registry in Canada. We used multivariable log-binomial regression models to estimate the PAF and 95% confidence interval (CI) of LGA neonates due to prepregnancy obesity and excessive gestational weight gain. All models were stratified by race (White, Asian, and Black).ResultsOf the 74,402 eligible women, the prevalence of prepregnancy obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and LGA neonate was 21.1%, 60.0%, and 11.3%, respectively, for Whites; 9.3%, 45.9%, and 5.4%, respectively, for Asians; and 28.6%, 52.4%, and 7.9%, respectively, for Blacks. The association of prepregnancy obesity was greater than that of excessive gestational weight gain on LGA for all racial groups. Excessive gestational weight gain contributed more than prepregnancy obesity in Whites (PAF 32.9%, 95% CI [30.3–35.5%] and 16.6%, 95% CI [15.3–17.9%], respectively, for excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy obesity) and in Asians (PAF 32.1%, 95% CI [27.2–36.7%] and 11.8%, 95% CI [9.5–14.1%], respectively, for excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy obesity). Prepregnancy obesity (PAF 22.8%, 95% CI [17.1–28.1%]) and excessive gestational weight gain (PAF 20.1%, 95% CI [4.7–33.0%]) contributed to LGA neonates almost the same in Blacks.ConclusionsExcessive gestational weight gain contributed more to LGA neonates than prepregnancy obesity in Whites and Asians, while there was no difference between excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy obesity in their contributions to the LGA neonates in Blacks. The differences are mostly driven by the differential prevalence of the two risk factors across racial groups."
"We evaluated the changes in visual field mean deviation (VF MD) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in glaucoma patients undergoing trabeculectomy. One hundred patients were examined with VF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) before trabeculectomy and 4 follow-up visits over one year. Linear mixed models were used to investigate factors associated with VF and RNFL. VF improved during the first 3 months of follow-up (2.55 ± 1.06 dB/year) and worsened at later visits (−1.14 ± 0.29 dB/year). RNFL thickness reduced by −4.21 ± 0.25 µm/year from 1st month of follow-up. Eyes with an absence of initial VF improvement (β = 0.64; 0.30–0.98), RNFL thinning (β = 0.15; 0.08–0.23), increasing intraocular pressure (IOP; β = −0.11; −0.18 to −0.03) and severe glaucoma (β = −10.82; −13.61 to −8.02) were associated with VF deterioration. Eyes with VF deterioration (β = 0.19; 0.08–0.29), increasing IOP (β = −0.09; −0.17 to −0.01), and moderate (β = −6.33; −12.17 to −0.49) or severe glaucoma (β = −19.58; −24.63 to −14.52) were associated with RNFL thinning. Changes in RNFL structure and function occur over a 1-year follow-up period after trabeculectomy. Early VF improvement is more likely to occur in patients with mild/moderate glaucoma, whereas those with severe glaucoma show greater decline over one year. Our findings indicate that progression is observable using OCT, even in late-stage glaucoma."
"The objective of this study is to analyze noise patterns during 599 visceral surgical procedures. Considering work-safety regulations, we will identify immanent noise patterns during major visceral surgeries. Increased levels of noise are known to have negative health impacts. Based on a very fine-grained data collection over a year, this study will introduce a new procedure for visual representation of intra-surgery noise progression and pave new paths for future research on noise reduction in visceral surgery. Digital decibel sound-level meters were used to record the total noise in three operating theatres in one-second cycles over a year. These data were matched to archival data on surgery characteristics. Because surgeries inherently vary in length, we developed a new procedure to normalize surgery times to run cross-surgery comparisons. Based on this procedure, dBA values were adjusted to each normalized time point. Noise-level patterns are presented for surgeries contingent on important surgery characteristics: 16 different surgery types, operation method, day/night time point and operation complexity (complexity levels 1–3). This serves to cover a wide spectrum of day-to-day surgeries. The noise patterns reveal significant sound level differences of about 1 dBA, with the most-common noise level being spread between 55 and 60 dBA. This indicates a sound situation in many of the surgeries studied likely to cause stress in patients and staff. Absolute and relative risks of meeting or exceeding 60 dBA differ considerably across operation types. In conclusion, the study reveals that maximum noise levels of 55 dBA are frequently exceeded during visceral surgical procedures. Especially complex surgeries show, on average, a higher noise exposure. Our findings warrant active noise management for visceral surgery to reduce potential negative impacts of noise on surgical performance and outcome."
"Chronic inflammation during pregnancy (e.g., preeclampsia, diabetes) is linked to increased risk for offspring neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, mediators of such exposures that could be targeted with maternal intervention are unclear, as few chronic gestational inflammation models have been tested. One potential mediator is interleukin-17 (IL-17), a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and gestational disease. To test chronic maternal IL-17 impacts on offspring, C57BL/6J dams were administered IL-17A continuously throughout pregnancy. Offspring were assessed for body weight; cortical volume, gene expression, and cellular composition; and adult behavior. IL-17A-condition offspring exhibited decreased somatic and cortical size at embryonic day 18 (E18) and as adults. mRNA sequencing of E18 cortex revealed 320 differentially expressed genes in males, but none in females. These were significantly enriched for ASD (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative), synaptic, and cell cycle genes. By adulthood, neocortical glial cell density and gene expression were decreased, while GABAergic synaptic gene expression was increased in males. Furthermore, IL-17A-condition male but not female offspring exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior. Social approach deficits in males were negatively correlated with neocortical GABAergic synaptic gene expression. Chronic gestational IL-17A was sufficient to cause ASD-like phenotypes early and persistently in male offspring. This echoes the male bias, altered cortical development, and behavioral findings in ASD, suggesting that chronic maternal IL-17 contributes to offspring ASD pathogenesis. Furthermore, the trajectory from embryonically dysregulated synaptic and cell cycle genes to disrupted adult glia, inhibitory synapses, and behavior suggests a mechanism for chronic maternal IL-17 effects on offspring."
"Current risk prediction models estimate the probability of developing breast cancer over a defined period based on information such as family history, non-genetic breast cancer risk factors, genetic information from high and moderate risk breast cancer susceptibility genes and, over the past several years, polygenic risk scores (PRS) from more than 300 common variants. The inclusion of additional data such as PRS improves risk stratification, but it is anticipated that the inclusion of epigenetic marks could further improve model performance accuracy. Here, we present the case for including information on DNA methylation marks to improve the accuracy of these risk prediction models, and consider how this approach contrasts genetic information, as identifying DNA methylation marks associated with breast cancer risk differs inherently according to the source of DNA, approaches to the measurement of DNA methylation, and the timing of measurement. We highlight several DNA-methylation-specific challenges that should be considered when incorporating information on DNA methylation marks into risk prediction models, using BRCA1, a highly penetrant breast cancer susceptibility gene, as an example. Only after careful consideration of study design and DNA methylation measurement will prospective performance of the incorporation of information regarding DNA methylation marks into risk prediction models be valid."
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), representing ~15% of globally diagnosed breast cancer, is typically an incurable malignancy due to the lack of targetable surface targets for development of effective therapy. To address the unmet need for TNBC treatment, we recently determined that tissue factor (TF) is a useful surface target in 50–85% of patients with TNBC and developed a second-generation TF-targeting antibody-like immunoconjugate (called L-ICON) for preclinical treatment of TNBC. Using the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach, here we develop and test TF-targeting CAR-engineered natural killer (TF-CAR-NK) cells that co-express CD16, the Fc receptor (FcγIII) to mediate antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC), for a preclinical assessment of immunotherapy of TNBC using TF-CAR-NK cell as single agent therapy and in combination with L-ICON. Our preclinical results demonstrate that TF-CAR-NK cells alone could kill TNBC cells and its efficacy was enhanced with L-ICON ADCC in vitro. Moreover, TF-CAR-NK cells were effective in vivo for the treatment of TNBC in cell line- and patient’s tumor-derived xenograft mouse models. Thus, this study established the proof of concept of targeting TF as a new target in CAR-NK immunotherapy for effective treatment of TNBC and may warrant further preclinical study and potentially future investigation in TNBC patients."
"Cognitive decline is one of the complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising dietary intervention for alleviating T2D symptoms, but its protective effect on diabetes-driven cognitive dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we find that a 28-day IF regimen for diabetic mice improves behavioral impairment via a microbiota-metabolites-brain axis: IF enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism gene expression in hippocampus, re-structures the gut microbiota, and improves microbial metabolites that are related to cognitive function. Moreover, strong connections are observed between IF affected genes, microbiota and metabolites, as assessed by integrative modelling. Removing gut microbiota with antibiotics partly abolishes the neuroprotective effects of IF. Administration of 3-indolepropionic acid, serotonin, short chain fatty acids or tauroursodeoxycholic acid shows a similar effect to IF in terms of improving cognitive function. Together, our study purports the microbiota-metabolites-brain axis as a mechanism that can enable therapeutic strategies against metabolism-implicated cognitive pathophysiologies."
"Data from several large high-throughput drug response screens have become available to the scientific community recently. Although many efforts have been made to use this information to predict drug sensitivity, our ability to accurately predict drug response based on genetic data remains limited. In order to systematically examine how different aspects of modelling affect the resulting prediction accuracy, we built a range of models for seven drugs (erlotinib, pacliatxel, lapatinib, PLX4720, sorafenib, nutlin-3 and nilotinib) using data from the largest available cell line and xenograft drug sensitivity screens. We found that the drug response metric, the choice of the molecular data type and the number of training samples have a substantial impact on prediction accuracy. We also compared the tasks of drug response prediction with tissue type prediction and found that, unlike for drug response, tissue type can be predicted with high accuracy. Furthermore, we assessed our ability to predict drug response in four xenograft cohorts (treated either with erlotinib, gemcitabine or paclitaxel) using models trained on cell line data. We could predict response in an erlotinib-treated cohort with a moderate accuracy (correlation ≈ 0.5), but were unable to correctly predict responses in cohorts treated with gemcitabine or paclitaxel."
"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are a group of functionally versatile proteins that play critical roles in the biogenesis, cellular localization and transport of RNA. Here, we outline a role for hnRNPs in gene regulatory circuits controlling sterol homeostasis. Specifically, we find that tissue-selective loss of the conserved hnRNP RALY enriches for metabolic pathways. Liver-specific deletion of RALY alters hepatic lipid content and serum cholesterol level. In vivo interrogation of chromatin architecture and genome-wide RALY-binding pattern reveal insights into its cooperative interactions and mode of action in regulating cholesterogenesis. Interestingly, we find that RALY binds the promoter region of the master metabolic regulator Srebp2 and show that it directly interacts with coactivator Nuclear Transcription Factor Y (NFY) to influence cholesterogenic gene expression. Our work offers insights into mechanisms orchestrating selective promoter activation in metabolic control and a model by which hnRNPs can impact health and disease states."
"Small molecule compounds are necessary to detect with high sensitivity since they may cause a strong effect on the human body even in small concentrations. But existing methods used to evaluate small molecules in blood are inconvenient, costly, time-consuming, and do not allow for portable usage. In response to these shortcomings, we introduce a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor bio-microelectromechanical system (CMOS BioMEMS) based piezoresistive membrane-bridge (MB) sensor for detecting small molecule (phenytoin) concentrations as the demonstration. Phenytoin is one of anticonvulsant drugs licensed for the management of seizures, which has a narrow therapeutic window hence a level of concentration monitoring was needed. The MB sensor was designed to enhance the structural stability and increase the sensitivity, which its signal response increased 2-fold higher than that of the microcantilever-based sensor. The MB sensor was used to detect phenytoin in different concentrations from 5 to 100  μg/mL. The limit of detection of the sensor was 4.06 ± 0.15  μg/mL and the linear detection range was 5–100  μg/mL, which was within the therapeutic range of phenytoin concentration (10–20  μg/mL). Furthermore, the MB sensor was integrated with an on-chip thermal effect eliminating modus and a reaction tank on a compact chip carrier for disposable utilization. The required amount of sample solution was only 10  μL and the response time of the sensor was about 25  minutes. The nano-mechanical MB sensing method with thermal effect compensation is specific, sensitive, robust, affordable and well reproducible; it is, therefore, an appropriate candidate for detecting small molecules."
"Extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance was reportedly helpful for predicting the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. However, only a few data exist on the clinical implication of semi-quantitative assessment LGE extent in this patient population. The extent of left ventricular (LV) LGE was measured in 310 consecutive HCM patients using semi-quantitative (summing the LV segments with LGE, spatial extent) and quantitative (calculating the LGE volume percentage [vol% of LGE] against the total LV myocardial volume) methods, respectively. LV LGE was detected in 255 (82%) patients, most frequently in the mid-LV septum (n = 160, 52%). During the 49 ± 45 month follow-up, spontaneous VTA events were observed in 48 patients (16%) including aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), appropriate defibrillator shock, and non-sustained VTA. The extent of LGE assessed by the two different methods showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman’s r = 0.63, P < 0.001). Moreover, there was a graded increase in the rates of VTA with the LGE extent evaluated semi-quantitatively and quantitatively. The extent of LGE was identified as an independent predictor of VTA events and more extensive LGE (positive ≥ 4 segments) significantly raised the risk of VTA, irrespective of the presence of conventional risk factors for SCD including family history, unexplained syncope, LV wall thickness ≥30 mm. The extent of LGE, whether assessed by semi-quantitative or quantitative methods, was closely associated with an increased risk of spontaneous VTA events in HCM patients."
"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation reportedly occurs frequently after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in resolved HBV-infected patients. Here, 50 patients with resolved HBV infections and scheduled to undergo HSCT were enrolled; all subjects were vaccinated with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine 12 months after HSCT and the incidence of HBV reactivation was monitored. The patients’ characteristics were: median age, 61 (34–72) years; male/female, 27/19; allogeneic/autologous, 40/6; bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cells/cord blood, 26/16/4. Of the 46 patients who underwent HSCT, 19 were excluded and did not make it to vaccination due to relapse of underlying disease, HBV reactivation within 12 months of HSCT, or transfer of patients. The remaining 27 were vaccinated 12 months after HSCT and monitored for 2 years. Six showed HBV reactivation, with a 2-year cumulative reactivation incidence of 22.2%; the same incidence was 27.3% only in allogeneic HSCT patients. Factors associated with HBV reactivation included the discontinuation of immunosuppressants (P = 0.0379) and baseline titers of antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (P = 0.004). HBV reactivation with vaccination following HSCT could occur despite maintenance of serum anti-HBs at more than protective levels."
"The aim of this study was to measure muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) dynamics during a climbing specific task until failure in varying conditions. Our prediction was that SmO2 should be a good marker to predict task failure. Eleven elite level climbers performed a finger-hang test on a 23 mm wooden rung under four different weighted conditions, 1. body weight (BW), 2. body weight +20% (BW +20), 3. body weight −20% (BW −20) and 4. body weight −40% (BW −40), maintaining half crimp grip until voluntary exhaustion. During each trial SmO2 and time to task failure (TTF) were measured. TTF was then compared to the minimally attainable value of SmO2 (SmO2min) and time to SmO2min (TTmin). There is a considerable degree of agreement between attainable SmO2min at high intensity conditions (MBW = 21.6% ± 6.4; MBW+20 = 24.0% ± 7.0; MBW−20 = 23.0% ± 7.3). Bland-Altman plot with an a priori set equivalency interval of ±5% indicate that these conditions are statistically not different (MBW-BW + 20 = −2.4%, 95% CI [1.4, −6.2]; MBW−Bw−20 = −1.3, 95% CI [2.5, −5.1]). The fourth and lowest intensity condition (MBW −40 = 32.4% ± 8.8) was statistically different and not equivalent (MBW-BW −40 = −8.8%, 95% CI [−5.0, −12.6]). The same agreement was found between TTF and TTmin for the high intensity conditions plotted via Bland-Altman. While the rate with which oxygen was extracted and utilised changed with the conditions, the attainable SmO2min remained constant at high intensity conditions and was related to TTF."
"Although, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of bovine mastitis, they do not address the regeneration of mammary glandular tissue and have been associated to the increment in antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Considering the necessity of alternative therapies for this disease of high economic impact and the reported regenerative and antibacterial effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs), we evaluated the safety and efficacy of an allogenic MSC-based intramammary therapy in dairy cows with experimentally induced Staphylococcus aureus clinical mastitis. In a safety trial, heifers were inoculated intramammarily with a 2.5 × 107-suspension of bovine fetal AT-MSCs on experimental days 1 and 10. Animals were evaluated clinically on a daily basis during a 20-day experimental period and blood samples were collected for hemogram determination and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) isolation. In an efficacy trial, Holstein Friesian cows were inoculated with S. aureus and treated intramammarily with vehicle (NEG; days 4 and 10), antibiotics (ATB; days 4 and 5) or a suspension of 2.5 × 107 AT-MSCs (MSC; days 4 and 5). Cows were clinically evaluated daily and milk samples were collected for somatic cell count (SCC) and colony forming units (CFU). Blood samples were collected for serum haptoglobin and amyloid A determination. Intramammary administration of two doses of bovine fetal AT-MSCs in healthy cows did not induce changes in clinical or hematological variables, and gene expression profiles in PBLs associated to activation (CD4, CD8, CD25, CD62L and CD69) and proinflammatory cytokines (CCL2, CCL5, IL2, CXCL3, IFNγ, and TNFα). Quarters of MSC group of cows had similar SCC log/mL in milk compared to infected quarters of ATB or NEG cows. However, quarters of MSC cows had lower CFU log/mL in milk compared to quarters of NEG cows. Intramammarily inoculation of repeated doses of 2.5 × 107 allogenic AT-MSCs did not induce clinical or immunological response in healthy cows. Moreover, MSC-intramammary treatment reduced bacterial count in milk of cows with S. aureus clinical mastitis compared to untreated cows. This work provides initial evidence for the safety and efficacy of an allogenic MSC-based intramammary therapy for the treatment of bovine mastitis."
"The trabecular meshwork’s (TM) physiological role is to maintain normal intraocular pressure by regulating aqueous humor outflow. With age, and particularly in eyes with primary open angle glaucoma, the number of cells residing within the TM is markedly decreased and the function of the tissue is compromised. Here we evaluate if transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell derived TM like cells (iPSC-TM) restores TM cellularity and function in human eyes obtained from older human donors. Human iPSC were differentiated into iPSC-TM and compared to primary TM cells by RNAseq. iPSC-TM were then injected into the anterior segments of human eyes maintained in perfusion culture. Seven and 14 days eyes after injection eyes that received iPSC-TM contained significantly more cells in the TM. Fewer than 1% of all cells appeared to be iPSC-TM, but significantly more cells in these eyes were immunopositive for Ki 67 and incorporated BrdU. Our study demonstrates that transplantation iPSC-TM stimulates proliferation of endogenous TM cells in perfusion cultured human eyes from aged donors. These data, in concert with our previous findings in animal models, suggest that functional regeneration of the TM may be possible in human eyes with primary open angle glaucoma."
"Hepatic fibrosis is a common pathological consequence of a sustained wound healing response to continuous liver injury, characterized by increased production and accumulation of extracellular matrix. If unresolved, the fibrotic process results in organ failure, and eventually death after the development of cirrhosis. It has been suggested that macrophages play central role in the progression of hepatic fibrosis, which is related to inflammation and pyroptosis, a novel programmed and proinflammatory cell death. However, it remains far less clear if, or how, lncRNAs regulates the activation and pyroptosis of macrophage in hepatic fibrosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the liver-enriched lncRNA Lfar1, which has been reported to promote hepatic fibrosis through inducing hepatic stellate cells activation and hepatocytes apoptosis, was dysregulated during proinflammatory M1 activation and pyroptosis of macrophage. Our study revealed that silencing lnc-Lfar1 by a lentivirus-shRNA alleviated CCl4- and BDL-induced proinflammatory M1 macrophage activation and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that lnc-Lfar1 knockdown significantly suppressed LPS- and IFN-γ-induced proinflammatory activation of macrophages, and inhibited LPS/ATP- and LPS/Nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Mechanistically, lnc-Lfar1 regulated LPS- and IFN-γ-induced proinflammatory activation of macrophages through the NF-ĸB pathway. All these data supported our conclusion that lnc-Lfar1 plays a vital role in controlling the activation and pyroptosis of macrophage, thus providing a possible therapeutic target against inflammation-related disorders including hepatic fibrosis."
"The highly selective magnesium transporter non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 2 (NIPA2) has recently been associated with the development and progression of type 2 diabetes osteoporosis, but the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Because mitophagy is involved in the pathology of type 2 diabetes osteoporosis, the present study aimed to explore the relationship among NIPA2, mitophagy and osteoblast osteogenic capacity. NIPA2 expression was reduced in C57BKS background db/db mice and in vitro models of type 2 diabetes osteoporosis, and the activation of mitophagy in primary culture osteoblast-derived from db/db mice and in high glucose-treated human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOB1.19) was observed. Knockdown, overexpression of NIPA2 and pharmacological inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) showed that NIPA2 increased osteoblast function, which was likely regulated by PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 (Parkin)-mediated mitophagy via the PGC-1α/forkhead box O3a(FoxO3a)/mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) pathway. Furthermore, the negative effect of mitophagy on osteoblast function was confirmed by pharmacological regulation of mitophagy and knockdown of Parkin. Taken together, these results suggest that NIPA2 positively regulates the osteogenic capacity of osteoblasts via the mitophagy pathway in type 2 diabetes."
"Glomeruloid architecture is the least common Gleason 4 growth pattern in prostate adenocarcinoma. Its clinicopathological features and relation with cribriform architecture, which has been recognized as an adverse feature, remains to be established. Our objective was to investigate clinicopathological features of glomeruloid architecture in radical prostatectomies. We reviewed 1064 radical prostatectomy specimens and recorded Grade Group, pT-stage, margin status, Gleason pattern percentages, and growth patterns. Simple and complex glomerulations were distinguished by gland size and intraluminal cribriform protrusions. Clinical endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival. Glomerulations were identified in 365 (34%) specimens. In 472 Grade Group 2 patients, 210 (44%) had simple and 92 (19%) complex glomerulations. Complex glomerulations coincided with cribriform architecture more often than simple glomerulations (67% versus 52%; P = 0.01). Men with simple glomerulations had significantly lower prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (9.7 versus 12.1 ng/ml; P = 0.03), percentage Gleason pattern 4 (19% versus 25%; P = 0.001), extra-prostatic extension (34% versus 50%; P = 0.01), and positive surgical margins (25% versus 39%; P = 0.04) than those with cribriform architecture. Extra-prostatic extension (37%) and positive surgical margins (30%) in men with complex glomerulations resembled those with simple glomeruloid rather than those with cribriform architecture. In multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for PSA, pT-stage, margin status, and lymph node metastases, cribriform architecture had independent predictive value for biochemical recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–2.9; P = 0.004), while simple (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.5–1.2; P = 0.26) and complex (HR 0.9; 95% CI 0.5–1.6; P = 0.67) glomerulations did not. Both simple and complex glomeruloid architecture are associated with better outcome than cribriform architecture in Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients. Therefore, glomeruloid pattern and particularly complex glomerulations should not be classified as a cribriform growth pattern variant in radical prostatectomy specimens."
"Abdominal Aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with chronic inflammation, cells apoptosis, and impairment of autophagy. BP-1-102, a novel potent STAT3 inhibitor, has been recently reported to significantly block inflammation-related signaling pathways of JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB, as well as regulate autophagy. However, its role in vascular inflammation and AAA progression remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the effect and potential mechanisms of BP-1-102 on angiotensin II (AngII) induced AAA in ApoE−/− mice were investigated. AAA was induced in ApoE−/− mice with infusion of AngII for 28 days. BP-1-102 was administrated orally to mice every other day. Mice were sacrificed on day 7, day 14, and day 28 to evaluate the treatment effects. BP-1-102 markedly decreased AAA incidence and aortic diameter, maintained elastin structure and volume, reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, and inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration. Moreover, BP-1-102 dramatically reduced the expression of JAK2, p-STAT3, p-NF-κB, and Bcl-xL but maintained the expression of LC3B and Beclin in AAA tissues. In vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with AngII and/or BP-1-102 at indicated time and concentration. BP-1-102 inhibited AngII-induced JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling activation and maintained autophagy-related proteins expression in VSMCs. Taken together, our findings suggest that BP-1-102 inhibits vascular inflammation and AAA progression through decreasing JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB activation and maintaining autophagy."
"Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) plays an important role in clinical liver tumor therapy. However, hypoxia after TAE limit the medium-long term efficacy of TAE. Thus, in our study, we explored the treatment effect and mechanism of combining transcatheter arterial embolization with adopted iodized oil containing Apatinib on suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. We simulated the changing of tumor microenvironment before and after TAE both in vitro and in vivo models. The anti-angiogenic effect of Apatinib was explored by bioassays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), including cell migration, invasion and apoptosis, tube formation, and wound healing. Further experiments showed that Apatinib inhibited tumor microangiogenesis to achieve the aims of inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence by means of down-regulating the phosphorylation of the RAF-mek-erk, PI3K-akt and P38MAPK pathways. The antitumor growth and anti-angiogenic effect of Apatinib was further validated by the animal experiment. Taken together, we concluded that Apatinib inhibits the angiogenesis and growth of liver cancer by down-regulating the PI3K-akt, RAF-mek-erk and P38MAPK pathways, and has a stronger inhibitory effect in hypoxic environments. Combining TAE with adopted iodized oil containing Apatinib has a stronger inhibitory effect in VX2 liver tumor growth and metastasis, which suggesting such combinations may provide a new target and strategy for interventional therapy of liver cancer."
"Brain metastases are a very common manifestation of cancer that have historically been approached as a single disease entity given the uniform association with poor clinical outcomes. Fortunately, our understanding of the biology and molecular underpinnings of brain metastases has greatly improved, resulting in more sophisticated prognostic models and multiple patient-related and disease-specific treatment paradigms. In addition, the therapeutic armamentarium has expanded from whole-brain radiotherapy and surgery to include stereotactic radiosurgery, targeted therapies and immunotherapies, which are often used sequentially or in combination. Advances in neuroimaging have provided additional opportunities to accurately screen for intracranial disease at initial cancer diagnosis, target intracranial lesions with precision during treatment and help differentiate the effects of treatment from disease progression by incorporating functional imaging. Given the numerous available treatment options for patients with brain metastases, a multidisciplinary approach is strongly recommended to personalize the treatment of each patient in an effort to improve the therapeutic ratio. Given the ongoing controversies regarding the optimal sequencing of the available and expanding treatment options for patients with brain metastases, enrolment in clinical trials is essential to advance our understanding of this complex and common disease. In this Review, we describe the key features of diagnosis, risk stratification and modern paradigms in the treatment and management of patients with brain metastases and provide speculation on future research directions."
"Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), an ATPase subunit of the SWItch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex controls multipotent neural crest formation by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes with adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). The expression of BRG1 engages in pre-mRNA splicing through interacting RNPs in cancers; however, the detailed molecular pathology of how BRG1and CHD7 relate to cancer development remains largely unveiled. This study demonstrated novel post-transcriptional regulation of BRG1 in EMT and relationship with FIRΔexon2, which is a splicing variant of the far-upstream element-binding protein (FUBP) 1-interacting repressor (FIR) lacking exon 2, which fails to repress c-myc transcription in cancers. Previously, we have reported that FIR complete knockout mice (FIR−/−) was embryonic lethal before E9.5, suggesting FIR is crucial for development. FIRΔexon2 acetylated H3K27 on promoter of BRG1 by CHIP-sequence and suppressed BRG1 expression post-transcriptionally; herein BRG1 suppressed Snai1 that is a transcriptional suppressor of E-cadherin that prevents cancer invasion and metastasis. Ribosomal proteins, hnRNPs, splicing-related factors, poly (A) binding proteins, mRNA-binding proteins, tRNA, DEAD box, and WD-repeat proteins were identified as co-immunoprecipitated proteins with FIR and FIRΔexon2 by redoing exhaustive mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, the effect of FIRΔexon2 on FGF8 mRNA splicing was examined as an indicator of neural development due to impaired CHD7 revealed in CHARGE syndrome. Expectedly, siRNA of FIRΔexon2 altered FGF8 pre-mRNA splicing, indicated close molecular interaction among FIRΔexon2, BRG1 and CHD7. FIRΔexon2 mRNA was elevated in human gastric cancers but not in non-invasive gastric tumors in FIR+/ mice (K19-Wnt1/C2mE x FIR+/−). The levels of FIR family (FIR, FIRΔexon2 and PUF60), BRG1, Snai1, FBW7, E-cadherin, c-Myc, cyclin-E, and SAP155 increased in the gastric tumors in FIR+/− mice compared to those expressed in wild-type mice. FIR family, Snai1, cyclin-E, BRG1, and c-Myc showed trends toward higher expression in larger tumors than in smaller tumors in Gan-mice (K19-Wnt1/C2mE). The expressions of BRG1 and Snai1 were positively correlated in the gastric tumors of the Gan-mice. Finally, BRG1 is a candidate substrate of F-box and WD-repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) revealed by three-dimensional crystal structure analysis that the U2AF-homology motif (UHM) of FIRΔexon2 interacted with tryptophan-425 and asparate-399 (WD)-like motif in the degron pocket of FBW7 as a UHM-ligand motif. Together, FIRΔexon2 engages in multi-step post-transcriptional regulation of BRG1, affecting EMT through the BRG1/Snai1/E-cadherin pathway and promoting tumor proliferation and invasion of gastric cancers."
"GPR81 is a G-protein-coupled receptor for lactate, which is upregulated in breast cancer and plays an autocrine role to promote tumor growth by tumor cell-derived lactate. Here we asked whether lactate has any paracrine role via activation of GPR81 in cells present in tumor microenvironment to help tumor growth. First, we showed that deletion of Gpr81 suppresses breast cancer growth in a constitutive breast cancer mouse model (MMTV-PyMT-Tg). We then used a syngeneic transplant model by monitoring tumor growth from a mouse breast cancer cell line (AT-3, Gpr81-negative) implanted in mammary fat pad of wild-type mice and Gpr81-null mice. Tumor growth was suppressed in Gpr81-null mice compared with wild-type mice. There were more tumor-infiltrating T cells and MHCIIhi-immune cells in tumors from Gpr81-null mice compared with tumors from wild-type mice. RNA-seq analysis of tumors indicated involvement of immune cells and antigen presentation in Gpr81-dependent tumor growth. Antigen-presenting dendritic cells expressed Gpr81 and activation of this receptor by lactate suppressed cell-surface presentation of MHCII. Activation of Gpr81 in dendritic cells was associated with decreased cAMP, IL-6 and IL-12. These findings suggest that tumor cell-derived lactate activates GPR81 in dendritic cells and prevents presentation of tumor-specific antigens to other immune cells. This paracrine mechanism is complementary to the recently discovered autocrine mechanism in which lactate induces PD-L1 in tumor cells via activation of GPR81 in tumor cells, thus providing an effective means for tumor cells to evade immune system. As such, blockade of GPR81 signaling could boost cancer immunotherapy."
"Canine leishmaniasis is a major veterinary issue and also a public health challenge due to its zoonotic potential. In this context, serological evaluation is essential for Canine leishmaniasis management. Several serological alternatives, such as rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), are well established. In fact, the capacity of distinct tests and antigens, evaluated by their sensitivity and specificity, to detect disease is normally considered sufficient for diagnosing Canine leishmaniasis. In this context, we evaluated the seropositivity using 8 different serological tests (ELISA with Leishmania recombinant proteins (rK39, LicTXNPx); soluble promastigote Leishmania antigens (SPLA); commercial ELISA test) in 82 clinically suspect animals from Northern Portugal. The obtained serological data originated 50% of inconclusive serological information with a mixture of seropositive and seronegative results for individual animals. Cut-off independent risk groups were then generated from the serological data to evaluate the clustering of the samples. This analysis originated risk groups that correlated with the most seropositive samples, suggesting that this method might be used, in a cut-off independent manner, to improve conventional serological evaluation. Ultimately, given that no test prioritization exists, the use of any single serological test increases the potential for misdiagnosis, along with all associated risks for the dog as well as public health. The use of a cut-off independent analysis has the potential to improve the predictive values of these tests, enabling a more accurate evaluation of the dog’s condition."
"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common diseases associated with pregnancy, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Based on the well documented role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes, the aim was to investigate the role of inflammation in GDM. We established a mouse model for GDM on the basis of its two major risk factors, obesity and aging. In these GDM mice, we observed increased Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression in the uterus and the placenta along with elevated circulating IL-1β concentrations compared to normoglycemic pregnant mice. Treatment with an anti-IL-1β antibody improved glucose-tolerance of GDM mice without apparent deleterious effects for the fetus. Finally, IL-1β antagonism showed a tendency for reduced plasma corticosterone concentrations, possibly explaining the metabolic improvement. We conclude that IL-1β is a causal driver of impaired glucose tolerance in GDM."
"Altered circulatory asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines have been independently reported in patients with end-stage renal failure suggesting their potential role as mediators and early biomarkers of nephropathy. These alterations can also be reflected in urine. Herein, we aimed to evaluate urinary asymmetric to symmetric dimethylarginine ratio (ASR) for early prediction of diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this cross-sectional study, individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD), diabetic microalbuminuria (MIC), macroalbuminuria (MAC), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were recruited from Dr. Mohans’ Diabetes Specialties centre, India. Urinary ASR was measured using a validated high-throughput MALDI-MS/MS method. Significantly lower ASR was observed in MIC (0.909) and MAC (0.741) in comparison to the NGT and NDD groups. On regression models, ASR was associated with MIC [OR: 0.256; 95% CI: 0.158–0.491] and MAC [OR 0.146; 95% CI: 0.071–0.292] controlled for all the available confounding factors. ROC analysis revealed ASR cut-point of 0.95 had C-statistic of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.627-0.755) to discriminate MIC from NDD with 72% sensitivity. Whereas, an ASR cut-point of 0.82 had C-statistic of 0.846 (95% CI: 0.800 - 0.893) had 91% sensitivity for identifying MAC. Our results suggest ASR as a potential early diagnostic biomarker for DN among the Asian Indians."
"In this analysis, the levels of CRP and IL-8 were employed as a guide for designing the duration of antibiotics administration in the condition of febrile neutropenia. The importance of laboratory biomarkers is in the early diagnosis of critical illness and adjustment of further management. IL-8 is a useful biomarker for the early identification of critically ill patients, compared to CRP in FN."
"A continuing quest for specific inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines brings promise for effective therapies designed for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Cefazolin, a safe, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, has been recently shown to specifically interact with interleukin 15 (IL-15) receptor subunit α (IL-15Rα) and to inhibit IL-15-dependent TNF-α and IL-17 synthesis. The aim of this study was to elucidate cefazolin activity against IL-2, IL-4, IL-15 and IL-21, i.e. four cytokines sharing the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc). In silico, molecular docking unveiled two potential cefazolin binding sites within the IL-2/IL-15Rβ subunit and two within the γc subunit. In vitro, cefazolin decreased proliferation of PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) following IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 stimulation, reduced production of IFN-γ, IL-17 and TNF-α in IL-2- and IL-15-treated PBMC and in IL-15 stimulated natural killer (NK) cells, attenuated IL-4-dependent expression of CD11c in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and suppressed phosphorylation of JAK3 in response to IL-2 and IL-15 in PBMC, to IL-4 in TF-1 (erythroleukemic cell line) and to IL-21 in NK-92 (NK cell line). The results of the study suggest that cefazolin may exert inhibitory activity against all of the γc receptor-dependent cytokines, i.e. IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21."
"Circulating HER2 extracellular domain (HER2 ECD) levels were proposed as a surrogate for HER2 tissue expression to monitor breast cancer patients for early relapse or responses to standard or HER2-targeted therapies, such as the monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab. Currently, available commercial ELISA assays for HER2 ECD rely on antibodies recognizing undisclosed or unknown epitopes. In this work, two ELISA assays employing MGR2 and MGR3 epitope-specific mAbs for HER2 ECD were developed and validated, showing good assay precision and linearity of the dose-response signal within the dynamic range of 0.19–12.50 ng mL−1 and detection limits of 0.76 and 0.75 ng mL−1 for the MGR2 and MGR3 assays, respectively. The developed assay showed a good agreement with two widely used commercial kits for HER2 ECD quantification in serum samples from breast cancer patients. A complete characterization of mAb-HER2 ECD interaction was performed by means of surface plasmon resonance using trastuzumab as control for both epitope mapping and kinetics analysis. The epitopes recognized by the two mAbs showed no overlap with trastuzumab, which was confirmed by trastuzumab interference analysis in serum samples. The method showed to be a practical approach to determine HER2 ECD with a high degree of sensitivity, reliability and recovery in samples containing mAbs-based therapies."
"BackgroundsAside from Gleason score few factors accurately identify the subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients at high risk for metastatic progression. We hypothesized that copy number alterations (CNAs), assessed using CpG methylation probes on Illumina Infinium® Human Methylation450 (HM450K) BeadChip arrays, could identify primary prostate tumors with potential to develop metastatic progression.MethodsEpigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in surgically resected primary tumor tissues from two cohorts of PCa patients with clinically localized disease who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) as primary therapy and were followed prospectively for at least 5 years: (1) a Fred Hutchinson (FH) Cancer Research Center-based cohort (n = 323 patients); and (2) an Eastern Virginia (EV) Medical School-based cohort (n = 78 patients). CNAs were identified using the R package ChAMP. Metastasis was confirmed by positive bone scan, MRI, CT or biopsy, and death certificates confirmed cause of death.ResultsWe detected 15 recurrent CNAs were associated with metastasis in the FH cohort and replicated in the EV cohort (p < 0.05) without adjusting for Gleason score in the model. Eleven of the recurrent CNAs were associated with metastatic progression in the FH cohort and validated in the EV cohort (p < 0.05) when adjusting for Gleason score.ConclusionsThis study shows that CNAs can be reliably detected from HM450K-based DNA methylation data. There are 11 recurrent CNAs showing association with metastatic-lethal events following RP and improving prediction over Gleason score. Genes affected by these CNAs may functionally relate to tumor aggressiveness and metastatic progression."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, and cartilage and bone destruction. Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1) functions as a transcriptional repressor and plays a vital role in inflammatory reactions. However, whether NR1D1 is involved in synovial inflammation and joint destruction during the pathogenesis of RA is unknown. In this study, we found that NR1D1 expression was increased in synovial tissues from patients with RA and decreased in RA Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) stimulated with IL-1β in vitro. We showed that NR1D1 activation decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), while NR1D1 silencing exerted the opposite effect. Furthermore, NR1D1 activation reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased the production of nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-associated enzymes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways were blocked by the NR1D1 agonist SR9009 but activated by NR1D1 silencing. NR1D1 activation also inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and suppressed osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-related genes expression. Treatment with NR1D1 agonist SR9009 in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse significantly suppressed the hyperplasia of synovial, infiltration of inflammatory cell and destruction of cartilage and bone. Our findings demonstrate an important role for NR1D1 in RA and suggest its therapeutic potential."
"Primrose syndrome is characterized by variable intellectual deficiency, behavior disorders, facial features with macrocephaly, and a progressive phenotype with hearing loss and ectopic calcifications, distal muscle wasting, and contractures. In 2014, ZBTB20 variants were identified as responsible for this syndrome. Indeed, ZBTB20 plays an important role in cognition, memory, learning processes, and has a transcription repressive effect on numerous genes. A more severe phenotype was discussed in patients with missense single nucleotide variants than in those with large deletions. Here, we report on the clinical and molecular results of 14 patients: 6 carrying ZBTB20 missense SNVs, 1 carrying an early truncating indel, and 7 carrying 3q13.31 deletions, recruited through the AnDDI-Rares network. We compared their phenotypes and reviewed the data of the literature, in order to establish more powerful phenotype–genotype correlations. All 57 patients presented mild-to-severe ID and/or a psychomotor delay. Facial features were similar with macrocephaly, prominent forehead, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, and large ears. Hearing loss was far more frequent in patients with missense SNVs (p = 0.002), ectopic calcification, progressive muscular wasting, and contractures were observed only in patients with missense SNVs (p nonsignificant). Corpus callosum dysgenesis (p = 0.00004), hypothyroidism (p = 0.047), and diabetes were also more frequent in this group. However, the median age was 9.4 years in patients with deletions and truncating variant compared with 15.1 years in those with missense SNVs. Longer follow-up will be necessary to determine whether the phenotype of patients with deletions is also progressive."
"We present the Tesco Grocery 1.0 dataset: a record of 420 M food items purchased by 1.6 M fidelity card owners who shopped at the 411 Tesco stores in Greater London over the course of the entire year of 2015, aggregated at the level of census areas to preserve anonymity. For each area, we report the number of transactions and nutritional properties of the typical food item bought including the average caloric intake and the composition of nutrients. The set of global trade international numbers (barcodes) for each food type is also included. To establish data validity we: i) compare food purchase volumes to population from census to assess representativeness, and ii) match nutrient and energy intake to official statistics of food-related illnesses to appraise the extent to which the dataset is ecologically valid. Given its unprecedented scale and geographic granularity, the data can be used to link food purchases to a number of geographically-salient indicators, which enables studies on health outcomes, cultural aspects, and economic factors."
"Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of locally administered ADSCs in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse model. In an in vivo experiment, single-cell ADSCs and three dimensionally-cultured ADSC spheroids were injected intra-articularly into the knees of RA model mice and histologically assessed. Marked improvement of synovial inflammation and articular cartilage regeneration was found in ADSC-treated mice. Proliferation, migration, and apoptosis assays of synovial fibroblasts incubated with single-cell and spheroid ADSCs were performed. The expression levels of total cytokine RNA in ADSC single cells, spheroids, and ADSC-treated inflammatory synovial fibroblasts were also evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. ADSCs suppressed the proliferation and migration of activated inflammatory cells and downregulated inflammatory cytokines. TSG-6 and TGFβ1 were significantly upregulated in ADSCs compared to controls and TGFβ1 was significantly upregulated in ADSC spheroids compared to single cells. The apoptosis rate of ADSC spheroids was significantly lower than that of single-cell ADSCs. These results indicated that intra-articular administration of ADSC single cells and spheroids was effective in an RA mouse model, offering a novel approach for the development of effective localized treatments for patients with RA."
"Drug-evoked adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system are postulated to drive opioid abuse and addiction. These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological and behavioral impact. We exposed male and female mice to morphine for one week, with administration patterns that were either intermittent (daily injections) or continuous (osmotic minipump infusion). We then interrupted continuous morphine exposure with either naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal. Continuous morphine exposure caused tolerance to the psychomotor-activating effects of morphine, whereas both intermittent and interrupted morphine exposure caused long-lasting psychomotor sensitization. Given links between locomotor sensitization and mesolimbic dopamine signaling, we used fiber photometry and a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to conduct longitudinal measurements of dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens. Locomotor sensitization caused by interrupted morphine exposure was accompanied by enhanced dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens. To further assess downstream consequences on striatal gene expression, we used next-generation RNA sequencing to perform genome-wide transcriptional profiling in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. The interruption of continuous morphine exposure exacerbated drug-evoked transcriptional changes in both nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, dramatically increasing differential gene expression and engaging unique signaling pathways. Our study indicates that opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior are critically dependent on the pattern of drug administration, and exacerbated by interruption of continuous exposure. Maintaining continuity of chronic opioid administration may, therefore, represent a strategy to minimize iatrogenic effects on brain reward circuits."
"Scaling sports equipment to match the physical development of children allows motor skills to be performed with greater success and with more desirable movement patterns. It is unknown, however, how scaled equipment affects movement variability – a key factor associated with coordination. Our aim was to identify whether scaled sports equipment facilitates coordination and functional movement variability in children when performing a hitting for accuracy task in tennis. Twenty-five children were asked to execute a forehand stroke with the aim of hitting the ball to a target located 10 metres away. Participants performed the task in two conditions – a scaled equipment condition and a full-sized equipment condition. Scaled equipment led to superior hitting accuracy and greater temporal stability of the swing compared to full-sized equipment. Scaled equipment also afforded the emergence of a functional coupling between upper arm and forearm movement variability which helped regulate the distance between the shoulder and the racket. Comparatively there was a lack of coupling when full-sized equipment was used. Hence, scaled equipment promoted functional movement variability, whereas full-sized equipment resulted in the freezing of mechanical degrees of freedom. This suggests that children’s skill acquisition could be hindered and potentially regress when using inappropriately sized equipment."
"Crohn’s disease causes chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and its pathogenesis remains unclear. In the intestine of Crohn’s disease patients, CD14+CD11+CD163low macrophages contribute to inflammation through the induction of Th17 cells and production of inflammatory cytokines; the CD14+CD11c+163high fraction is anti-inflammatory through the production of IL-10 in normal cases. In this report, the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing method was used to identify bacteria that are specifically present in intestinal CD14+CD11c+ macrophages of Crohn’s disease patients. Bacteria present in intestinal CD14+CD11c+ macrophages and mucus of Crohn’s disease patients were separated into different clusters in principal coordinates analysis. There was a statistically significant increase in the relative composition of CD14+CD11c+ macrophages from mucus in two phyla (Proteobacteria [p = 0.01] and Actinobacteria [p = 0.02]) and two families (Moraxellaceae [p < 0.001] and Pseudomonadaceae [p = 0.01]). In addition, OTU-1: Acinetobacter and OTU-8: Pseudomonadaceae tended to concentrate in the CD14+CD11c+CD163low subset, whereas OTU-10: Proteus, OTU-15: Collinsella tended to concentrate more in the CD14+CD11c+CD163high subset than the other subset and mucus."
"Study designSurvey study.ObjectivesSpinal cord injury (SCI)-associated pneumonia (SCI-AP) is associated with poor functional recovery and a major cause of death after SCI. Better tackling SCI-AP requires a common understanding on how SCI-AP is defined. This survey examines clinical algorithms relevant for diagnosis and treatment of SCI-AP.SettingAll departments for SCI-care in Germany.MethodsThe clinical decision-making on SCI-AP and the utility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of ‘clinically defined pneumonia’ were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire including eight case vignettes of suspected SCI-AP. The diagnostic decisions based on the case information were analysed using classification and regression trees (CART).ResultsThe majority of responding departments were aware of the CDC-criteria (88%). In the clinical vignettes, 38–81% of the departments diagnosed SCI-AP in accordance with the CDC-criteria and 7–41% diagnosed SCI-AP in deviation from the CDC-criteria. The diagnostic agreement was not associated with the availability of standard operating procedures for SCI-AP management in the departments. CART analysis identified radiological findings, fever, and worsened gas exchange as most important for the decision on SCI-AP. Frequently requested supplementary diagnostics were microbiological analyses, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. For empirical antibiotic therapy, the departments used (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, or combinations of (acyl-)aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors with fluoroquinolones or carbapenems.ConclusionsThis survey reveals a diagnostic ambiguity regarding SCI-AP despite the awareness of CDC-criteria and established SOPs. Heterogeneous clinical practice is encouraging the development of disease-specific guidelines for diagnosis and management of SCI-AP."
"Arrhythmia constitutes a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, and an early diagnosis is essential for the timely inception of successful treatment. We have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based on 12-lead surface ECGs that attains the accuracy performance level of professional cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs from 40,258 patients with four arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust LOESS, Non Local Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F1-Score of 0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier achieved an F1-Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold cross-validation F1-Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed optimal multi-stage arrhythmia classification approach can dramatically benefit automatic ECG data analysis by providing cardiologist level accuracy and robust compatibility with various ECG data sources."
"The current study aimed to formulate Selenium-Chitosan-Mupirocin (M-SeNPs-CCH) complex. The nanohybrid system was prepared using chitosan-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based hydrogel (CCH) that entrapped mupirocin (M) and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). The in vitro studies were performed by evaluation of the antibacterial activity and toxicity on L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. The in vivo study was conducted on rat diabetic wound infection model that was infected by mupirocin-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MMRSA). The wounds were treated by M-SeNPs-CCH nanohybrid system with concentrations of M; 20 mg/ml, CCH; 2 mg/ml and SeNPs; 512 μg/ml in two times/day for 21 days. The therapeutic effect of this nanohybrid system was evaluated by monitoring wound contraction and histopathological changes. Evaluation of the average wound healing time showed a significant difference between the treatment and control groups (P≤0.05). The histopathological study indicated that the amount of wound healing was considerable in M-SeNPs-CCH nanohybrid system groups compared to the control and M groups. The M-SeNPs-CCH nanohybrid system formulated in this study was able to reduce 3-fold MIC of mupirocin with synergistic antibacterial activity as well as to play a significant role in wound contraction, angiogenesis, fibroblastosis, collagenesis, proliferation of hair follicle, and epidermis growth compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.05). This research suggests that this nanohybrid system might be a development for the treatment of diabetic wound infection at mild stage."
"BackgroundIt is important to establish cancer stem cell (CSC)-targeted therapies to eradicate cancer. As it is a CSC marker, we focused on Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in this study.MethodsWe searched for candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) that inhibited KLF5 expression by in silico analyses and screened them in colon cancer cell lines.ResultsWe identified one promising miRNA, miR-4711-5p, that downregulated KLF5 expression by direct binding. This miRNA suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability, as well as stemness, including decreased stem cell marker expression, reactive oxygen species activity and sphere formation ability. MiR-4711-5p inhibited the growth of DLD-1 xenografts in nude mice with no adverse effects. We found that miR-4711-5p provoked G1 arrest, which could be attributed to direct binding of miR-4711-5p to TFDP1 (a heterodimeric partner of the E2F family). Our findings also suggested that direct binding of miR-4711-5p to MDM2 could upregulate wild-type p53, leading to strong induction of apoptosis. Finally, we found that miR-4711-5p had a potent tumour-suppressive effect compared with a putative anti-oncomiR, miR-34a, in tumour cell cultures derived from five patients with colorectal cancer.ConclusionsOur data suggest that miR-4711-5p could be a promising target for CSC therapy."
"ObjectiveTo measure the macronutrient content (MNC) of donor human milk labelled as 24 kcal/oz (“high-calorie DHM,” hcDHM), compare to bank-labelled MNC, and examine variability of hcDHM MNC among milk banks.Study designMNC was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy for 75 convenience samples from five milk banks collected during September 2016–July 2017. Concordance of measured MNC with labelled values was evaluated using three different thresholds: within ±20%, similar to FDA labelling standards for class II nutrients in foods; ±10%; and ±5%.ResultsProtein and caloric content differed significantly between measured and labelled values and varied significantly among milk banks. Measured caloric content ranged from 16.50 to 30.27 kcal/oz, with 89.3% of hcDHM samples within ±20%, 58.7% within ±10%, and 18.7% within ±5% of labelled content.ConclusionsMNC of hcDHM used in clinical practice shows variation that may result in differences from desired diet. The clinical implications of such differences are unexplored."
"Low blood phosphate (Pi) reduces muscle function in hypophosphatemic disorders. Which Pi transporters are required and whether hormonal changes due to hypophosphatemia contribute to muscle function is unknown. To address these questions we generated a series of conditional knockout mice lacking one or both house-keeping Pi transporters Pit1 and Pit2 in skeletal muscle (sm), using the postnatally expressed human skeletal actin-cre. Simultaneous conditional deletion of both transporters caused skeletal muscle atrophy, resulting in death by postnatal day P13. smPit1−/−, smPit2−/− and three allele mutants are fertile and have normal body weights, suggesting a high degree of redundance for the two transporters in skeletal muscle. However, these mice show a gene-dose dependent reduction in running activity also seen in another hypophosphatemic model (Hyp mice). In contrast to Hyp mice, grip strength is preserved. Further evaluation of the mechanism shows reduced ERK1/2 activation and stimulation of AMP kinase in skeletal muscle from smPit1−/−; smPit2−/− mice consistent with energy-stress. Similarly, C2C12 myoblasts show a reduced oxygen consumption rate mediated by Pi transport-dependent and ERK1/2-dependent metabolic Pi sensing pathways. In conclusion, we here show that Pit1 and Pit2 are essential for normal myofiber function and survival, insights which may improve management of hypophosphatemic myopathy."
"Paclitaxel is widely used in cancer treatments, but poor water-solubility and toxicity raise serious concerns. Here we report an RNA four-way junction nanoparticle with ultra-thermodynamic stability to solubilize and load paclitaxel for targeted cancer therapy. Each RNA nanoparticle covalently loads twenty-four paclitaxel molecules as a prodrug. The RNA-paclitaxel complex is structurally rigid and stable, demonstrated by the sub-nanometer resolution imaging of cryo-EM. Using RNA nanoparticles as carriers increases the water-solubility of paclitaxel by 32,000-fold. Intravenous injections of RNA-paclitaxel nanoparticles with specific cancer-targeting ligand dramatically inhibit breast cancer growth, with nearly undetectable toxicity and immune responses in mice. No fatalities are observed at a paclitaxel dose equal to the reported LD50. The use of ultra-thermostable RNA nanoparticles to deliver chemical prodrugs addresses issues with RNA unfolding and nanoparticle dissociation after high-density drug loading. This finding provides a stable nano-platform for chemo-drug delivery as well as an efficient method to solubilize hydrophobic drugs."
"Circadian rhythms are 24-h cycles regulated by endogeneous molecular oscillators called the circadian clock. The effects of diet on circadian rhythmicity clearly involves a relationship between factors such as meal timings and nutrients, known as chrononutrition. Chrononutrition is influenced by an individual’s “chronotype”, whereby “evening chronotypes” or also termed “later chronotype” who are biologically driven to consume foods later in the day. Research in this area has suggested that time of day is indicative of having an influence on the postprandial glucose response to a meal, therefore having a major effect on type 2 diabetes. Cross-sectional and experimental studies have shown the benefits of consuming meals early in the day than in the evening on postprandial glycaemia. Modifying the macronutrient composition of night meals, by increasing protein and fat content, has shown to be a simple strategy to improve postprandial glycaemia. Low glycaemic index (GI) foods eaten in the morning improves glycaemic response to a greater effect than when consumed at night. Timing of fat and protein (including amino acids) co-ingested with carbohydrate foods, such as bread and rice, can reduce glycaemic response. The order of food presentation also has considerable potential in reducing postprandial blood glucose (consuming vegetables first, followed by meat and then lastly rice). These practical recommendations could be considered as strategies to improve glycaemic control, rather than focusing on the nutritional value of a meal alone, to optimize dietary patterns of diabetics. It is necessary to further elucidate this fascinating area of research to understand the circadian system and its implications on nutrition that may ultimately reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes."
"About 10–20% of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) are unresponsive to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and are at increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). Early identification is critical to initiate aggressive therapies, but available scoring systems lack sensitivity in non-Japanese populations. We investigated the accuracy of 3 Japanese scoring systems and studied factors associated with IVIg unresponsiveness in a large multiethnic French population of children with KD to build a new scoring system. Children admitted for KD between 2011–2014 in 65 centers were enrolled. Factors associated with second line-treatment; i.e. unresponsiveness to initial IVIg treatment, were analyzed by multivariate regression analysis. The performance of our score and the Kobayashi, Egami and Sano scores were compared in our population and in ethnic subgroups. Overall, 465 children were reported by 84 physicians; 425 were classified with KD (55% European Caucasian, 12% North African/Middle Eastern, 10% African/Afro-Caribbean, 3% Asian and 11% mixed). Eighty patients (23%) needed second-line treatment. Japanese scores had poor performance in our whole population (sensitivity 14–61%). On multivariate regression analysis, predictors of secondary treatment after initial IVIG were hepatomegaly, ALT level ≥30 IU/L, lymphocyte count <2400/mm3 and time to treatment <5 days. The best sensitivity (77%) and specificity (60%) of this model was with 1 point per variable and cut-off ≥2 points. The sensitivity remained good in our 3 main ethnic subgroups (74–88%). We identified predictors of IVIg resistance and built a new score with good sensitivity and acceptable specificity in a non-Asian population."
"The nonlinear trimodal regression analysis (NTRA) method based on radiodensitometric CT distributions was recently developed and assessed for the quantification of lower extremity function and nutritional parameters in aging subjects. However, the use of the NTRA method for building predictive models of cardiovascular health was not explored; in this regard, the present study reports the use of NTRA parameters for classifying elderly subjects with coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic heart failure (CHF) using multivariate logistic regression and three tree-based machine learning (ML) algorithms. Results from each model were assembled as a typology of four classification metrics: total classification score, classification by tissue type, tissue-based feature importance, and classification by age. The predictive utility of this method was modelled using CHF incidence data. ML models employing the random forests algorithm yielded the highest classification performance for all analyses, and overall classification scores for all three conditions were excellent: CHD (AUCROC: 0.936); CVD (AUCROC: 0.914); CHF (AUCROC: 0.994). Longitudinal assessment for modelling the prediction of CHF incidence was likewise robust (AUCROC: 0.993). The present work introduces a substantial step forward in the construction of non-invasive, standardizable tools for associating adipose, loose connective, and lean tissue changes with cardiovascular health outcomes in elderly individuals."
"Starvation enhances olfactory sensitivity that encourage animals to search for food. The molecular mechanisms that enable sensory neurons to remain flexible and adapt to a particular internal state remain poorly understood. Here, we study the roles of GABA and insulin signaling in starvation-dependent modulation of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) function in the Drosophila larva. We show that GABAB-receptor and insulin-receptor play important roles during OSN modulation. Using an OSN-specific gene expression analysis, we explore downstream targets of insulin signaling in OSNs. Our results suggest that insulin and GABA signaling pathways interact within OSNs and modulate OSN function by impacting olfactory information processing. We further show that manipulating these signaling pathways specifically in the OSNs impact larval feeding behavior and its body weight. These results challenge the prevailing model of OSN modulation and highlight opportunities to better understand OSN modulation mechanisms and their relationship to animal physiology."
"A 47-year-old man with metastatic melanoma presented with refractory hyperlactaemic acidosis following the first dose of the mono-carboxylase transporter 1 inhibitor AZD3965 within a “first time in man” clinical trial. The mechanism of the agent and the temporal relationship suggested that this event was potentially drug related and recruitment was suspended. However, urinary metabolomics showed extensive abnormalities even prior to drug administration, leading to investigations for an underlying metabolic disorder. The lack of clinical symptoms from the elevated lactate and low blood glucose suggested a diagnosis of “hyper-Warburgism”, where the high tumour burden was associated with extensive glucose uptake and lactate efflux from malignant cells, and the subsequent impact on blood biochemistry. This was supported by an FDG-PET scan showing extensive glucose uptake in numerous metastases and lack of uptake in the brain. A review of the literature showed 16 case reports of “hyper-Warburgism” in non-haematological malignancies, none of them with melanoma, with most associated with a poor outcome. The patient was treated symptomatically, but died 2 months later. The development of AZD3965 continues with the exclusion of patients with elevated plasma lactate at screening added to the protocol as a safety measure.Trial identification number ClinicalTrials.Gov. NCT01791595."
"The axon guidance cue SLIT3 was identified as an osteoanabolic agent in two recent reports. However, these reports conflict in their nomination of osteoblasts versus osteoclasts as the key producers of skeletal SLIT3 and additionally offer conflicting data on the effects of SLIT3 on osteoclastogenesis. Here, aiming to address this discrepancy, we found no observable SLIT3 expression during human or mouse osteoclastogenesis and the only modest SLIT3-mediated effects on osteoclast differentiation. Conditional deletion of SLIT3 in cathepsin K (CTSK)-positive cells, including osteoclasts, had no effect on the number of osteoclast progenitors, in vitro osteoclast differentiation, overall bone mass, or bone resorption/formation parameters. Similar results were observed with the deletion of SLIT3 in LysM-positive cells, including osteoclast lineage cells. Consistent with this finding, bone marrow chimeras made from Slit3−/− donors that lacked SLIT3 expression at all stages of osteoclast development displayed normal bone mass relative to controls. Taken in context, multiple lines of evidence were unable to identify the physiologic function of osteoclast-derived SLIT3, indicating that osteoblasts are the major source of skeletal SLIT3."
"Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is routinely used in peritoneal dialysis patients and might aid fluid status assessment in patients with liver cirrhosis, but the effect of ascites volume removal on BIS-readings is unknown. Here we determined changes in BIS-derived parameters and clinical signs of fluid overload from before to after abdominal paracentesis. Per our pre-specified sample size calculation, we studied 31 cirrhotic patients, analyzing demographics, labs and clinical parameters along with BIS results. Mean volume of the abdominal paracentesis was 7.8 ± 2.6 L. From pre-to post-paracentesis, extracellular volume (ECV) decreased (20.2 ± 5.2 L to 19.0 ± 4.8 L), total body volume decreased (39.8 ± 9.8 L to 37.8 ± 8.5 L) and adipose tissue mass decreased (38.4 ± 16.0 kg to 29.9 ± 12.9 kg; all p < 0.002). Correlation of BIS-derived parameters from pre to post-paracentesis ranged from R² = 0.26 for body cell mass to R² = 0.99 for ECV. Edema did not correlate with BIS-derived fluid overload (FO ≥ 15% ECV), which occurred in 16 patients (51.6%). In conclusion, BIS-derived information on fluid status did not coincide with clinical judgement. The changes in adipose tissue mass support the BIS-model assumption that fluid in the peritoneal cavity is not detectable, suggesting that ascites (or peritoneal dialysis fluid) mass should be subtracted from adipose tissue if BIS is used in patients with a full peritoneal cavity."
"BackgroundThere are no available predictive models for survival in extremely preterm (EP) infants admitted to a referral Level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after the first day of life (DOL).ObjectiveTo determine if there are clinical variables present at admission that are associated with survival in an outborn EP population.Study designData were analyzed from EP infants admitted before DOL 100 from 2008 to 2016 (n = 744).ResultsWe found that prophylactic indomethacin (OR 1.98 (1.20–3.25) p = 0.007), admit DOL (OR 1.05 (1.02–1.08) p < 0.001), and birth in Franklin County, (OR 2.02 (95% CI, 1.04–3.90) p = 0.04) were all associated with survival. Using ROC analysis, the area under the curve for the provisional survival score was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64–0.75; p < 0.0001).ConclusionsThere are factors on admission to a referral Level IV NICU associated with survival in EP patients."
"As perspectives on cannabis continue to shift, understanding the physiological and behavioral effects of cannabis use is of paramount importance. Previous data suggest that cannabis use influences food intake, appetite, and metabolism, yet human research in this regard remains scant. The present study investigated the effects of cannabis administration, via different routes, on peripheral concentrations of appetitive and metabolic hormones in a sample of cannabis users. This was a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Twenty participants underwent four experimental sessions during which oral cannabis, smoked cannabis, vaporized cannabis, or placebo was administered. Active compounds contained 6.9 ± 0.95% (~50.6 mg) ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Repeated blood samples were obtained, and the following endocrine markers were measured: total ghrelin, acyl-ghrelin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and insulin. Results showed a significant drug main effect (p = 0.001), as well as a significant drug × time-point interaction effect (p = 0.01) on insulin. The spike in blood insulin concentrations observed under the placebo condition (probably due to the intake of brownie) was blunted by cannabis administration. A significant drug main effect (p = 0.001), as well as a trend-level drug × time-point interaction effect (p = 0.08) was also detected for GLP-1, suggesting that GLP-1 concentrations were lower under cannabis, compared to the placebo condition. Finally, a significant drug main effect (p = 0.01) was found for total ghrelin, suggesting that total ghrelin concentrations during the oral cannabis session were higher than the smoked and vaporized cannabis sessions. In conclusion, cannabis administration in this study modulated blood concentrations of some appetitive and metabolic hormones, chiefly insulin, in cannabis users. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning these effects may provide additional information on the cross-talk between cannabinoids and physiological pathways related to appetite and metabolism."
"Worldwide, lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality. Bruceine D (BD) has been shown to induce pancreatic cancer cell death via several different mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that BD inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation. Apoptosis and autophagy were the most important mechanisms involved in BD-induced lung cancer cell death, and complete autophagic flux was observed in A549 and NCI-H292 cells. In addition, BD significantly improved intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. BD-mediated cell apoptosis and autophagy were almost inhibited in cells pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger. Furthermore, MAPK signaling pathway activation contributed to BD-induced cell proliferation inhibition and NAC could eliminate p-ERK and p-JNK upregulation. Finally, an in vivo study indicated that BD inhibited the growth of lung cancer xenografts. Overall, BD is a promising candidate for the treatment of lung cancer owing to its multiple mechanisms and low toxicity."
"A key role of the gut microbiota in the establishment and maintenance of health, as well as in the pathogenesis of disease, has been identified over the past two decades. One of the primary modes by which the gut microbiota interacts with the host is by means of metabolites, which are small molecules that are produced as intermediate or end products of microbial metabolism. These metabolites can derive from bacterial metabolism of dietary substrates, modification of host molecules, such as bile acids, or directly from bacteria. Signals from microbial metabolites influence immune maturation, immune homeostasis, host energy metabolism and maintenance of mucosal integrity. Alterations in the composition and function of the microbiota have been described in many studies on IBD. Alterations have also been described in the metabolite profiles of patients with IBD. Furthermore, specific classes of metabolites, notably bile acids, short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan metabolites, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. This Review aims to define the key classes of microbial-derived metabolites that are altered in IBD, describe the pathophysiological basis of these associations and identify future targets for precision therapeutic modulation."
"ObjectiveTo compare rates of small- and large-for-gestational age (SGA and LGA) neonates using four different weight centiles, and to relate these classifications to neonatal morbidity.Study designNeonates born at 33–40 weeks’ gestation in a multiethnic population were classified as SGA or LGA by population reference (Fenton), population standard (INTERGROWTH), fetal growth curves (WHO), and customized (GROW) centiles. Likelihood of composite morbidity was determined compared with a common appropriate-for-gestational age referent group.ResultAmong 45,505 neonates, SGA and LGA rates varied up to threefold by different centiles. Those most likely to develop neonatal morbidity were SGA or LGA on both the population reference and an alternative centile. Customized centiles identified over twice as many at-risk SGA neonates.ConclusionsCustomized centiles were most useful in identifying neonates at increased risk of morbidity, and those that were small on both customized and population reference centiles were at the highest risk."
"We report a randomized prospective phase 3 study (CLL7), designed to evaluate the efficacy of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in patients with an early-stage high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Eight hundred patients with untreated-stage Binet A disease were enrolled as intent-to-treat population and assessed for four prognostic markers: lymphocyte doubling time <12 months, serum thymidine kinase >10 U/L, unmutated IGHV genes, and unfavorable cytogenetics (del(11q)/del(17p)/trisomy 12). Two hundred and one patients with ≥2 risk features were classified as high-risk CLL and 1:1 randomized to receive either immediate therapy with 6xFCR (Hi-FCR, 100 patients), or to be observed according to standard of care (Hi-W&W, 101 patients). The overall response rate after early FCR was 92.7%. Common adverse events were hematological toxicities and infections (61.0%/41.5% of patients, respectively). After median observation time of 55.6 (0–99.2) months, event-free survival was significantly prolonged in Hi-FCR compared with Hi-W&W patients (median not reached vs. 18.5 months, p < 0.001). There was no significant overall survival benefit for high-risk patients receiving early FCR therapy (5-year OS 82.9% in Hi-FCR vs. 79.9% in Hi-W&W, p = 0.864). In conclusion, although FCR is efficient to induce remissions in the Binet A high-risk CLL, our data do not provide evidence that alters the current standard of care “watch and wait” for these patients."
"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with a multitude of contributing genetic factors, many of which are related to inflammation. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most common genetic risk factor for AD and is related to a pro-inflammatory state. To test the hypothesis that microglia and AD-implicated cytokines were differentially associated with AD pathology based on the presence of APOE ε4, we examined the dorsolateral frontal cortex from deceased participants within a community-based aging cohort (n = 154). Cellular density of Iba1, a marker of microglia, was positively associated with tau pathology only in APOE ε4 positive participants (p = 0.001). The cytokines IL-10, IL-13, IL-4, and IL-1α were negatively associated with tau pathology, independent of Aβ1–42 levels, only in APOE ε4 negative participants. Overall, the association of mostly anti-inflammatory cytokines with less tau pathology suggests a protective effect in APOE ε4 negative participants. These associations are largely absent in the presence of APOE ε4 where tau pathology was significantly associated with increased microglial cell density. Taken together, these results suggest that APOE ε4 mediates an altered inflammatory response and increased tau pathology independent of Aβ1–42 pathology."
Systematic understanding of the metabolite signature of diseases may lead to a closer understanding of the disease pathogenesis and ultimately to the development of novel therapies and diagnostic tools. Here we compared for the first time the full metabolomic profiles of lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies obtained from plaque psoriasis patients and skin samples of healthy controls. Significant differences in the concentration levels of 29 metabolites were identified that provide several novel insights into the metabolic pathways of psoriatic lesions. The metabolomic profile of the lesional psoriatic skin is mainly characterized by hallmarks of increased cell proliferation. As no significant differences were identified between non-lesional skin and healthy controls we conclude that local inflammatory process that drives the increased cell proliferation is the main cause of the identified metabolomic shifts.
"The incidence of obesity-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and different types of cancers shed light on the importance of dietary control as preventive and treatment measures. However, long-term dietary control is challenging to achieve in most individuals. The use of energy restriction mimetic agents (ERMAs) as an alternative approach to affect the energy machinery of cancer cells has emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. ERMAs limit the high need for energy in rapidly growing tumor cells, with their survival rate strongly dependent on the robust availability of energy. In this context, initial phenotypic screening of an in-house pilot compound library identified a new class of aminothiazole anchored on coumarin scaffold as potent anticancer lead drug candidates with potential activity as ERMA. The identified chemotypes were able to inhibit glucose uptake and increase ROS content in cancer cells. Compounds 9b, 9c, 9i, 11b, and 11c were highly active against colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and HT-29, with half-maximal inhibitory concertation (IC50) range from 0.25 to 0.38 µM. Further biological evaluations of 9b and 9f using Western blotting, caspase activity, glucose uptake, ROS production, and NADPH/NADP levels revealed the ability of these lead drug candidates to induce cancer cell death via, at least in part, energy restriction. Moreover, the assessment of 9b and 9f synergistic activity with cisplatin showed promising outcomes. The current work highlights the significant potential of the lead compounds, 9b, and 9f as potential anticancer agents via targeting the cellular energy machinery in cancer cells."
"The interest on a potential association between cancer and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has clearly gained substantial traction over the last several years. This novel relationship was initially explored in experimental models of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and showed that both intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, the two main hallmarks of OSA, promoted alterations in both tumorigenesis and tumor malignant properties. In parallel, an intriguing role of obesity as a major interactive player in the relationship between cancer and OSA was postulated in the following contextual settings: (1) obesity (with or without OSA) is associated with increased risk of some types of cancer (both incidence and aggressiveness), whereas obesity could be protective for others (“obesity paradox”); (2) OSA has been associated with increased risk for some types of cancer (independent of obesity), but not with others; (3) More than 80% of adult patients with OSA are overweight and >50% are obese; (4) both OSA and obesity exhibit oscillations in tissue oxygen tensions in peripheral organs such as adipose tissues. Further understanding these complex relationships become all the more important considering that the prevalence of obesity, cancer and OSA are all increasing worldwide. In parallel, experimental models of OSA provide biological plausibility constructs to the clinical and epidemiological findings, suggesting that the metabolic and inflammatory changes induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation may foster or exacerbate immune and biomechanical alterations of the tumor microenvironment, including the expression of extracellular matrix components facilitating tumor progression."
"A rigidification strategy was applied to the preclinical candidate donecopride, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor possessing 5-HT4R agonist activity. Inspired by promising bioactive benzisoxazole compounds, we have conducted a pharmacomodulation study to generate a novel series of multitarget directed ligands. The chemical synthesis of the ligand was optimized and compounds were evaluated in vitro against each target and in cellulo. Structure-activity relationship was supported by docking analysis in human acetylcholinesterase binding site. Among the synthesized compounds, we have identified a novel hybrid 32a (3-[2-[1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-4-piperidyl]ethyl]-4-methoxy-1,2-benzoxazole) able to display nanomolar acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects and nanomolar Ki for 5-HT4R."
"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive cancers that occur spontaneously (sporadic MPNST) or from benign plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. MPNSTs metastasize easily, are therapy resistant and are frequently fatal. The molecular changes underlying the malignant transformation in the NF1 setting are incompletely understood. Here we investigate the involvement of microRNAs in this process. MicroRNA expression profiles were determined from a series of archival, paired samples of plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST. Ninety differentially expressed microRNAs were identified between the paired samples. Three downregulated microRNAs (let-7b-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-145-5p) and two upregulated microRNAs (miR135b-5p and miR-889-3p) in MPNST were selected for functional characterization. In general, their differential expression was validated in a relevant cell line panel but only partly in a series of unpaired, fresh frozen tumor samples. As part of the validation process we also analyzed microRNA expression profiles of sporadic MPNSTs observing that microRNA expression discriminates NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs. The role of microRNAs in cancer progression was examined in NF1-derived MPNST cell lines by transiently modulating microRNA levels. Our findings indicate that some microRNAs affect migratory and invasive capabilities and Wnt signaling activity but the effects are distinct in different cell lines. We conclude that miRNAs play essential regulatory roles in MPNST facilitating tumor progression."
"Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is a widely applied and useful procedure for spinal surgeries. However, posterior fixation has not yet been decided. We compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B. However, group U required more additional surgeries owing to complications."
"Acute and chronic steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (srGVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There are a number of reports on case series describing efficacy of ruxolitinib in both acute and chronic srGVHD. We conducted a prospective study (NCT02997280) in 75 patients with srGVHD (32 acute, 43 chronic, 41 adults, and 34 children). Patients with chronic GVHD had severe disease in 83% of cases, and acute GVHD patients had grade III–IV disease in 66% of cases. The overall response rate (ORR) was 75% (95% CI 57–89%) in acute GVHD and 81% (95% CI 67–92%) in chronic. Overall survival was 59% (95% CI 49–74%) in acute group and 85% (95% CI 70–93%). The major risk factors for lower survival were grade III–IV gastrointestinal involvement (29% vs 93%, p = 0.0001) in acute form and high disease risk score in chronic (65% vs 90%, p = 0.038). Toxicity was predominantly hematologic with 79% and 44% of grade III–IV neutropenia in acute and chronic groups, respectively. There was no difference between adults and children in terms of ORR (p = 0.31, p = 0.35), survival (p = 0.44, p = 0.12) and toxicity (p > 0.93). The study demonstrated that ruxolitinib is an effective option in acute and chronic srGVHD and can be used both in adults and children."
"α-Synucleinopathies are characterized by autonomic dysfunction and motor impairments. In the pure autonomic failure (PAF), α-synuclein (α-Syn) pathology is confined within the autonomic nervous system with no motor features, but mouse models recapitulating PAF without motor dysfunction are lacking. Here, we show that in TgM83+/− mice, inoculation of α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the stellate and celiac ganglia induces spreading of α-Syn pathology only through the autonomic pathway to both the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic innervation of peripheral organs bidirectionally. In parallel, the mice develop autonomic dysfunction, featured by orthostatic hypotension, constipation, hypohidrosis and hyposmia, without motor dysfunction. Thus, we have generated a mouse model of pure autonomic dysfunction caused by α-Syn pathology. This model may help define the mechanistic link between transmission of pathological α-Syn and the cardinal features of autonomic dysfunction in α-synucleinopathy."
"Exposure to some antiretroviral drugs, especially integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INsTI)-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been associated with weight gain in people living with HIV (PLWH) exceeding what would be a “return to health” phenomenon. Notwithstanding the fact that weight gain and obesity are multifactorial, the common epidemiological link in PLWH is INsTI-based cART. Here, we postulate that interference with the melanocortin system (MCS) functioning by INsTI plays an essential role in excess weight gain and obesity in PLWH, similar to disturbances caused by melanocortin receptor (MCR) mutations in the general population and by antipsychotic therapy in psychiatric patients."
"Despite recent advances in prosthetics, many upper limb amputees still use prostheses with some reluctance. They often do not feel able to incorporate the artificial hand into their bodily self. Furthermore, prosthesis fitting is not usually tailored to accommodate the characteristics of an individual’s phantom limb sensations. These are experienced by almost all persons with an acquired amputation and comprise the motor and postural properties of the lost limb. This article presents and validates a multimodal dataset including an extensive qualitative and quantitative assessment of phantom limb sensations in 15 transradial amputees, surface electromyography and accelerometry data of the forearm, and measurements of gaze behavior during exercises requiring pointing or repositioning of the forearm and the phantom hand. The data also include acquisitions from 29 able-bodied participants, matched for gender and age. Special emphasis was given to tracking the visuo-motor coupling between eye-hand/eye-phantom during these exercises."
"This paper evaluated 3-dimensional radiomics features of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as prognostic factors for predicting systemic recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and validated the results with a different MRI scanner. The Rad score was generated from 3-dimensional radiomic features of MRI for 231 TNBCs (training set (GE scanner), n = 182; validation set (Philips scanner), n = 49). The Clinical and Rad models to predict systemic recurrence were built up and the models were externally validated. In the training set, the Rad score was significantly higher in the group with systemic recurrence (median, −8.430) than the group without (median, −9.873, P < 0.001). The C-index of the Rad model to predict systemic recurrence in the training set was 0.97, which was significantly higher than in the Clinical model (0.879; P = 0.009). When the models were externally validated, the C-index of the Rad model was 0.848, lower than the 0.939 of the Clinical model, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.100). The Rad model for predicting systemic recurrence in TNBC showed a significantly higher C-index than the Clinical model. However, external validation with a different MRI scanner did not show the Rad model to be superior over the Clinical model."
"The neonatal mammalian heart is capable of regeneration for a brief window of time after birth. However, this regenerative capacity is lost within the first week of life, which coincides with a postnatal shift from anaerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, particularly towards fatty-acid utilization. Despite the energy advantage of fatty-acid beta-oxidation, cardiac mitochondria produce elevated rates of reactive oxygen species when utilizing fatty acids, which is thought to play a role in cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest through induction of DNA damage and activation of DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway. Here we show that inhibiting fatty-acid utilization promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in the postnatal heart. First, neonatal mice fed fatty-acid-deficient milk showed prolongation of the postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferative window; however, cell-cycle arrest eventually ensued. Next, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) knockout mouse model to selectively enhance oxidation of glycolytically derived pyruvate in cardiomyocytes. Conditional PDK4 deletion resulted in an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and consequently an increase in glucose relative to fatty-acid oxidation. Loss of PDK4 also resulted in decreased cardiomyocyte size, decreased DNA damage and expression of DDR markers and an increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation. Following myocardial infarction, inducible deletion of PDK4 improved left ventricular function and decreased remodelling. Collectively, inhibition of fatty-acid utilization in cardiomyocytes promotes proliferation, and may be a viable target for cardiac regenerative therapies."
"Lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the major source of fundus autofluorescence (FAF). A technical challenge to accurately quantify the FAF intensities, thus the lipofuscin concentration, is to compensate the light attenuation of RPE melanin. We developed the VIS-OCT-FAF technology to accomplish optical coherence tomography (OCT) and FAF simultaneously with a single broadband visible light source. We demonstrated that light attenuation by RPE melanin can be assessed and corrected using the depth-resolved OCT signals. FAF images from albino and pigmented rats showed that without compensation, FAF signals from pigmented rats are lower than that from albinos. After compensation, however, FAF signals from pigmented rats are higher. This finding is supported by measurements of lipofuscin fluorophore A2E in the RPE using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) showing that compensated FAF intensities correlate linearly with A2E contents. The present work represents an important step toward accurately assessing RPE lipofuscin concentrations by FAF."
"Cardiometabolic disorders were discussed and might be changed by microbiota in recent years. Since the colon acts as the primary reservoir of microbiota, we designed the present study to explore the association between colectomy and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We identified a total of 18,424 patients who underwent colectomy between 2000–2012 for reasons other than colorectal cancer from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients were matched with 18,424 patients without colectomy using a 1:1 propensity score by age, sex, and comorbidity. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to assess the risk of CVD. Patients with colectomy were found to be at lower risk of CVD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90–0.99) than patients without colectomy. Stratified analysis according to the type of surgery revealed patients who underwent cecectomy and right hemicolectomy were at lower risk of CVD (cecectomy: adjusted HR [aHR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64–0.94; right hemicolectomy: aHR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82–0.96). Patients who underwent left hemicolectomy were at higher risk of CVD (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.08–1.32). Our results indicate that the different colectomy procedures influence the risk for the CVD differently."
"AbstractRecent advances in pharmacological agents have led to successful treatment of a variety of retinal diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), and retinal vascular occlusions (RVO). These treatments often require repeated drug injections for an extended period of time. To reduce these repeated treatment burdens, minimally invasive drug delivery systems are needed. An ideal therapy should maintain effective levels of drug for the intended duration of treatment following a single application, recognising that a significant number of months of therapy may be required. There are numerous approaches under investigation to improve treatment options. This review will highlight the advantages and limitations of selected drug delivery systems of novel biomaterial implants and depots. The main emphasis will be placed on less invasive, longer acting, sustained release formulations for the treatment of retinal disorders."
"This retrospective clinical study investigated the survival probability of avulsed and replanted permanent teeth in relation to functional healing, replacement and inflammatory resorption. The explorative data analysis included data from 36 patients and 49 replanted permanent teeth with a minimum observation time of 60 days; the patients were generally treated according to the current guidelines of the International Association of Dental Traumatology at the university hospital in Munich, Germany, between 2004 and 2017. The mean observation period was 3.5 years. Functional healing was observed in 26.5% (N = 13/49) of the included avulsion cases. In comparison, replacement resorption affected 51.0% (N = 25/49) of the replanted teeth, of which 24.0% (N = 6/25) were lost over the course of years (mean, 6.1 years). In contrast, inflammatory resorption resulted in the early loss of all replanted teeth (mean, 1.7 years) and affected 22.5% (N = 11/49) of all the monitored teeth. Therefore, it can be concluded that tooth avulsion remains a severe dental injury with an unpredictable prognosis. This topic demands further fundamental research aiming to maintain and/or regenerate the periodontal ligament after tooth avulsion, particularly in association with non-physiological tooth rescue."
"To compare goblet cell (GC) number and area in the covered superior (SB) versus exposed temporal (TB) bulbar conjunctiva in control versus aqueous tear deficient eyes (ATD) and evaluate correlation with tear MUC5AC protein. SB and TB impression cytology performed on control eyes, Sjögren syndrome (SS) ATD, and non-SS ATD was stained with period acid Schiff. GC number and area were measured with image analysis software. Protein-normalized MUC5AC level was measured in Schirmer strip-collected tears. Compared to control conjunctiva, GC number and area were significantly lower in SS, non-SS, and combined ATD groups in exposed TB, and were also significantly lower in SS and combined ATD groups in covered SB. In all ATD, GC number and area were significantly correlated, but differences between SB and TB were non-significant. Normalized tear MUC5AC protein was lower in all ATD groups versus control eyes, and correlated only with GC area. GCs are significantly decreased in the covered and exposed conjunctiva in SS. GC area may be a better disease measure than number for ATD. Correlation between tear MUC5AC concentration and GC area suggests tear MUC5AC mucin can be used as a disease-relevant biomarker for conjunctiva GC health."
"After decades of sometimes fierce debate about the advantages and disadvantages of glucocorticoids, an age of convergence has been reached. Current recommendations for the management of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyalgia rheumatica and large vessel vasculitis reflect the current consensus that as much glucocorticoid as necessary, but as little as possible, should be used. Over the past few years, a range of glucocorticoid-sparing strategies have been developed, as have tools to improve the management of this therapy. A comprehensive view of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis has also emerged that recognizes that bone fragility is not solely determined by the dose and duration of glucocorticoid treatment. Nevertheless, open questions remain around whether long-term use of very low doses of glucocorticoids is a realistic option for patients with RA and whether the search for innovative glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid receptor ligands with improved benefit-to-risk ratios will ultimately be successful."
"Although early glaucoma detection is important to prevent visual loss due to disease progression, its clinical diagnosis in highly myopic eyes is still difficult. Many studies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) reported decreased vessel density (VD) in glaucomatous eyes compared to normal eyes. We evaluated the diagnostic ability of peripapillary VD and macular VD measured by OCTA, comparing them with conventional valuables such as peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness measured by OCT. We also calculated the average VD ratio (VDR) (average outer macular VD/average inner macular VD), superior VDR (superior outer macular VD/average inner macular VD), and inferior VDR (inferior outer macular VD/average inner macular VD). Totally, 169 eyes from 169 subjects were enrolled. Among OCTA measurements, the best diagnostic parameters were average VDR (AUROC: 0.852 and 0.909) and inferior VDR (AUROC: 0.820 and 0.941) in nonhighly and highly myopic eyes, respectively. Inferior VDR showed better diagnostic ability than most of the other OCT measurements including peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular GCIPL thickness in highly myopic eyes. Accordingly, OCTA measurements can be useful for diagnosing glaucoma in highly myopic eyes, especially when using calculated indices such as average VDR or inferior VDR."
"The sympathetic nervous system innervates peripheral organs to regulate their function and maintain homeostasis, whereas target cells also produce neurotrophic factors to promote sympathetic innervation1,2. The molecular basis of this bi-directional communication remains to be fully determined. Here we use thermogenic adipose tissue from mice as a model system to show that T cells, specifically γδ T cells, have a crucial role in promoting sympathetic innervation, at least in part by driving the expression of TGFβ1 in parenchymal cells via the IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC). Ablation of IL-17RC specifically in adipose tissue reduces expression of TGFβ1 in adipocytes, impairs local sympathetic innervation and causes obesity and other metabolic phenotypes that are consistent with defective thermogenesis; innervation can be fully rescued by restoring TGFβ1 expression. Ablating γδ Τ cells and the IL-17RC signalling pathway also impairs sympathetic innervation in other tissues such as salivary glands. These findings demonstrate coordination between T cells and parenchymal cells to regulate sympathetic innervation."
"Altered pulmonary angiogenesis contributes to disrupted alveolarization, which is the main characteristic of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) plays an important role during lung vascular development, and recent studies have demonstrated that endoglin is engaged in the modulation of TGFβ downstream signalling. Although there are two different isoforms of endoglin, L- and S-endoglin, little is known about the effect of S-endoglin in developing lungs. We analysed the expression of both L- and S-endoglin in the lung vasculature and its contribution to TGFβ-activin-like kinase (ALK)-Smad signalling with respect to BPD development. Hyperoxia impaired pulmonary angiogenesis accompanied by alveolar simplification in neonatal mouse lungs. S-endoglin, phosphorylated Smad2/3 and connective tissue growth factor levels were significantly increased in hyperoxia-exposed mice, while L-endoglin, phosphor-Smad1/5 and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 levels were significantly decreased. Hyperoxia suppressed the tubular growth of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), and the selective inhibition of ALK5 signalling restored tubular growth. These results indicate that hyperoxia alters the balance in two isoforms of endoglin towards increased S-endoglin and that S-endoglin attenuates TGFβ-ALK1-Smad1/5 signalling but stimulates TGFβ-ALK5-Smad2/3 signalling in pulmonary ECs, which may lead to impaired pulmonary angiogenesis in developing lungs."
"Protein-based nanobubbles such as halophilic archaeabacterial gas vesicles (GVs) represent a new class of stable, homogeneous nanoparticles with acoustic properties that allow them to be visualized by ultrasound (US) waves. To design GVs as theranostic agents, we modified them to respond to light, with a view to locally generate reactive oxygen species that can kill cancer cells. Specifically, up to 60,000 photoreactive chlorin e6 (Ce6) molecules were chemically attached to lysine ε-amino groups present on the surface of each purified Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 GV. The resulting fluorescent NRC-1 Ce6-GVs have dimensions comparable to that of native GVs and were efficiently taken up by human breast [MCF-7] and human hypopharyngeal [FaDu-GFP] cancer cells as monitored by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. When exposed to light, internalized Ce6-GVs were 200-fold more effective on a molar basis than free Ce6 at killing cells. These results demonstrate the potential of Ce6-GVs as novel and promising nanomaterials for image-guided photodynamic therapy."
"This study aimed to examine the effect of pool walking on renal function in pregnant women. Fifteen pregnant women (mean gestational age, 37.8 weeks) walked in a pool (depth 1.3 m) for 1 h. A few days later, they walked on a street for 1 h. Within each activity, the starting and ending levels of plasma renin activity were measured. The total urine volume, creatinine clearance, and change in plasma renin activity levels between each activity were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone level was suppressed during pool walking: the mean starting and ending values of plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 6.8 vs. 5.5 ng/mL/h (p = 0.002) and 654 vs. 473 pg/mL (p = 0.01), respectively. The decreases in plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels were more evident in pool walking than in land walking (plasma renin activity, −1.27 vs. 0.81 ng/mL/h, p = 0.002; serum aldosterone, −180.9 vs. 3.1 ng/mL/h, p = 0.03), resulting in higher total urine volume (299 vs. 80 mL, p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (161.4 vs. 123.4 mL/min, p = 0.03) in pool walking. Pool walking may improve renal function in pregnant women partly through the suppressed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a group of chronic interstitial pulmonary diseases characterized by myofibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition with limited treatment options. Based on our previous observation, we hypothesized microcystin-leucine arginine (LR), an environmental cyanobacterial toxin, could potentially suppress pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we first demonstrated that chronic exposure of microcystin-LR by oral for weeks indeed attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis both on bleomycin-induced rat and fluorescein isothiocyanate-induced mouse models. Our data further indicated that treatment with microcystin-LR substantially reduced TGF-β1/Smad signaling in rat pulmonary tissues. The experiments in vitro found that microcystin-LR was capable of blocking epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblast–myofibroblast transition (FMT) through suppressing the differentiation of CD206+ macrophages. Mechanically, microcystin-LR was found to bind to glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) and suppress endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPRER) signaling pathways. These events led to the modulation of M2 polarization of macrophages, which eventually contributed to the alleviation of pulmonary fibrosis. Our results revealed a novel mechanism that may account for therapeutic effect of microcystin-LR on IPF."
"Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic mechanism in Parkinson’s disease (PD). As an important cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) balances the production and incorporation of free radicals to protect neurons from oxidative damage. GSH level is decreased in the brains of PD patients. Hence, clarifying the molecular mechanism of GSH deficiency may help deepen our knowledge of PD pathogenesis. Here we report that the astrocytic dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) regulates GSH synthesis via PKM2-mediated Nrf2 transactivation. In addition we find that pyridoxine can dimerize PKM2 to promote GSH biosynthesis. Further experiments show that pyridoxine supplementation increases the resistance of nigral dopaminergic neurons to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in wild-type mice as well as in astrocytic Drd2 conditional knockout mice. We conclude that dimerizing PKM2 may be a potential target for PD treatment."
"To determine the epidemiological, histopathological, and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with penile cancer in the Brazilian state of Maranhão, the region with the highest incidence worldwide. One hundred and sixteen penile cancer patients were interviewed from July 2016 to October 2018. The majority of patients lived in a rural area (57%), worked in farming (58%), had a low level of schooling or no schooling (90%), and were married or in a stable relationship (74%). The mean age was 60.4 ± 16.51 years (range, 23–93 years). Phimosis (66%), poor/moderate genital hygiene (73%), history of sexually transmitted infections (55%), and zoophilia (60%) were found in the majority of patients. Most patients had their first sexual encounter at 16.2 ± 2.8 years (range, 10–25 years), and 75% had >6 sexual partners. The most common initial symptom was pruritus (37%), and most patients waited to seek treatment (average time to treatment, 18.9 months; range, 2–84 months). Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related histologies were observed in 62% of patients. Most patients had histological grades II or III (87%), stage ≥T2 disease (84%), and lymphadenopathy at admission (42%). Penectomy was performed in 96% of patients. The population with penile cancer in the region of highest incidence in the world is marked by low socioeconomic status, high prevalence of HPV infection, and phimosis. The delay in seeking treatment is related to a very high rate of advanced cancer and aggressive surgical treatment. The high prevalence of young patients was also a striking feature."
"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced cascade events are implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The discovery of drug candidates to protect dopaminergic (DA) neurons from ER-stress-induced oxidative damage is important to resolve the pathological aspects of PD and modify its progress. In this study, we found that a recently identified unfolded protein response (UPR) modulator, azoramide, showed protective effects on patient induced pluripotent stem cells-derived midbrain DA neurons with the homozygous phospholipase A2 group 6 (PLA2G6) D331Y mutant. A series of PD-related cascade events such as ER stress, abnormal calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis were observed in PLA2G6 D331Y mutant DA neurons, whereas azoramide significantly protected PLA2G6 D331Y mutant DA neurons against these events. The beneficial effects of azoramide were abolished by treatment with a cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) inhibitor. Our results suggest that azoramide is a potential neuroprotectant against DA neuron damage via restoring ER function and the CREB signaling."
"Colorectal cancer is a major contributor to death and disease worldwide. The ApcMin mouse is a widely used model of intestinal neoplasia, as it carries a mutation also found in human colorectal cancers. However, the method most commonly used to quantify tumour burden in these mice is manual adenoma counting, which is time consuming and poorly suited to standardization across different laboratories. We describe a method to produce suitable photographs of the small intestine of ApcMin mice, process them with an ImageJ macro, FeatureCounter, which automatically locates image features potentially corresponding to adenomas, and a machine learning pipeline to identify and quantify them. Compared to a manual method, the specificity (or True Negative Rate, TNR) and sensitivity (or True Positive Rate, TPR) of this method in detecting adenomas are similarly high at about 80% and 87%, respectively. Importantly, total adenoma area measures derived from the automatically-called tumours were just as capable of distinguishing high-burden from low-burden mice as those established manually. Overall, our strategy is quicker, helps control experimenter bias, and yields a greater wealth of information about each tumour, thus providing a convenient route to getting consistent and reliable results from a study."
"Influenza-related severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are severe threats to human health. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of systematic corticosteroid therapy in patients with pneumonia or ARDS. The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were searched up to July, 2019. Nineteen studies including 6637 individuals were identified, and fifteen studies (6427 patients) were included in the meta-analysis of mortality. Eighteen were observational studies and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The meta-analysis results showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly higher mortality (OR 1.53, 95% CI [1.16, 2.01]) and incidence of nosocomial infection (OR 3.15, 95% CI [1.54, 6.45]). Subgroup analysis showed that among patients with unadjusted estimates, the odds of mortality were higher in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment (OR 1.98, 95% CI [1.23, 3.17]), however, among patients with adjusted estimates, the result showed no statistically significant difference between corticosteroid group and control group (OR 1.31, 95% CI [0.95, 1.80]). Current data do not support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza severe pneumonia or ARDS. RCTs are needed to provide more robust evidence."
"Causal Structure Discovery (CSD) is the problem of identifying causal relationships from large quantities of data through computational methods. With the limited ability of traditional association-based computational methods to discover causal relationships, CSD methodologies are gaining popularity. The goal of the study was to systematically examine whether (i) CSD methods can discover the known causal relationships from observational clinical data and (ii) to offer guidance to accurately discover known causal relationships. We used Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because the well-established evidence provides a “gold-standard” causal graph for evaluation. We evaluated two CSD methods, Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used structural equation models (which is not designed for CSD) as control. We applied these methods under three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to the methods. The methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships with the “gold standard” graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated CSD methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard. For best results, CSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing as much prior knowledge as possible."
"PurposeHistorically, atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with an increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). However, uncertainty remained regarding the effect of AD itself and comorbidities (e.g., allergic diseases, cataract surgery) on RRD occurrence in a large, population-based paediatric population.Patients and methodsWe analysed the 12-year National Health Insurance Service database (2002–2013) covering the entire Korean population to estimate the association between AD and RRD in people aged under 20 years.ResultsWe identified 3142 RRD patients, and matched 18,852 controls (six controls to each RRD patient); therefore, we included 21,994 peoples under aged 20 years in the analyses. AD was more prevalent in the RRD group (329 patients, 10.47%) than the control group (1043 patients, 5.53%; P < 0.001), and so were severe AD (153 patients [4.87%] and 223 patients [1.18%], respectively; P < 0.001). In conditional logistic regression analysis, AD was associated with RRD (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.93–1.87) even after adjusting for allergic conditions, connective tissue disease, uveitis, and cataract surgery. In addition, severity of AD was associated with an increased risk of RRD (OR for non-severe AD and severe AD, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05–1.51] and 2.88 [95% CI, 2.25–3.68]).ConclusionThis study suggests that AD itself is a risk factor of RRD in children by showing the association between AD and RRD occurrence and the biologic gradient even after adjustment for known confounders including allergic conditions, uveitis, and cataract surgery."
"Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare, inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, characterized by red blood cell aplasia, developmental abnormalities, and enhanced risk of malignancy. However, the underlying pathogenesis of DBA is yet to be understood. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) L18 were identified in DBA patients. RPL18 is a crucial component of the ribosomal large subunit but its role in hematopoiesis remains unknown. To genetically model the ribosomal defect identified in DBA, we generated a rpl18 mutant line in zebrafish, using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Molecular characterization of this mutant line demonstrated that Rpl18 deficiency mirrored the erythroid defects of DBA, namely a lack of mature red blood cells. Rpl18 deficiency caused an increase in p53 activation and JAK2-STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found inhibitors of JAK2 or STAT3 phosphorylation could rescue anemia in rpl18 mutants. Our research provides a new in vivo model of Rpl18 deficiency and suggests involvement of signal pathway of JAK2-STAT3 in the DBA pathogenesis."
"Regulation of pancreas plasticity is critical for preventing injury and promoting regeneration upon tissue damage. The intricate process of pancreatic differentiation is governed by an orchestrated network of positive and negative transcription factors for appropriate gene expression. While the transcriptional repressor REST is well characterized as a silencer of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, the role of REST in regulating exocrine pancreas cell identity remains largely unexplored. Rest expression is increased upon injury in the mouse pancreas, such as induced acute and chronic pancreatitis and ductal adenocarcinoma. At the cellular level, Rest expression is lower in mature acinar cells compared with pancreas progenitor and ductal cells. To investigate the role of REST activity in pancreatic transdifferentiation and homeostasis, we developed a novel mouse model (Cre/RESTfl/fl) with conditional knockout (KO) of Rest expression within pancreas cells. The high Cre-mediated excision efficiency of Rest exon two KO caused decreased Rest expression and activity within the pancreas. Short-term organoid cultures of pancreatic acini to undergo acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) showed that loss of REST impedes induced ADM, while overexpression of REST increases ADM. Interestingly, REST ablation accelerated acute pancreatitis in mice treated with the cholecystokinin analog caerulein, as indicated by cellular morphology, elevated serum amylase levels and pancreatic edema. Furthermore, Cre/RESTfl/fl mice were more sensitive to acute pancreatitis injury and displayed augmented tissue damage and cellular lesions. These results suggest REST has a novel protective role against pancreatic tissue damage by acting as a regulator of exocrine cell identity."
"Emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance calls for development of non-chemical treatment options for bacterial infections. Plasma medicine applies low-temperature plasma (LTP) physics to address biomedical problems such as wound healing and tumor suppression. LTP has also been used for surface disinfection. However, there is still much to be learned regarding the effectiveness of LTP on bacteria in suspension in liquids, and especially on porous surfaces. We investigated the efficacy of LTP treatments against bacteria using an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet and show that LTP treatments have the ability to inhibit both gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria on solid and porous surfaces. Additionally, both direct LTP treatment and plasma-activated media were effective against the bacteria suspended in liquid culture. Our data indicate that reactive oxygen species are the key mediators of the bactericidal effects of LTP and hydrogen peroxide is necessary but not sufficient for antibacterial effects. In addition, our data suggests that bacteria exposed to LTP do not develop resistance to further treatment with LTP. These findings suggest that this novel atmospheric-pressure plasma jet could be used as a potential alternative to antibiotic treatments in vivo."
"The pathogenesis and clinical features of diabetic cardiomyopathy have been well-studied in the past decade, but effective approaches to prevent and treat this disease are limited. Diabetic cardiomyopathy occurs as a result of the dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus, which leads to increased oxidative stress and the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways that mediate cellular and extracellular injury, pathological cardiac remodelling, and diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes have identified multiple intracellular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and potential cardioprotective strategies to prevent and treat the disease, including antifibrotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants. Some of these interventions have been tested in clinical trials and have shown favourable initial results. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and we summarize the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that might provide guidance for the development of targeted strategies. We also highlight some of the novel pharmacological therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy."
"Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer of the developing retina that initiates by biallelic RB1 gene inactivation. Tumor progression in retinoblastoma is driven by epigenetics, as retinoblastoma genomes are stable, but the mechanism(s) that drive these epigenetic changes remain unknown. Lymphoid-specific helicase (HELLS) protein is an epigenetic modifier directly regulated by the RB/E2F pathway. In this study, we used novel genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the role of HELLS during retinal development and tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that Hells-null retinal progenitor cells divide, undergo cell-fate specification, and give rise to fully laminated retinae with minor bipolar cells defects, but normal retinal function. Despite the apparent nonessential role of HELLS in retinal development, failure to transcriptionally repress Hells during retinal terminal differentiation due to retinoblastoma (RB) family loss significantly contributes to retinal tumorigenesis. Loss of HELLS drastically reduced ectopic division of differentiating cells in Rb1/p107-null retinae, significantly decreased the incidence of retinoblastoma, delayed tumor progression, and increased overall survival. Despite its role in heterochromatin formation, we found no evidence that Hells loss directly affected chromatin accessibility in the retina but functioned as transcriptional co-activator of E2F3, decreasing expression of cell cycle genes. We propose that HELLS is a critical downstream mediator of E2F-dependent ectopic proliferation in RB-null retinae. Together with the nontoxic effect of HELLS loss in the developing retina, our results suggest that HELLS and its downstream pathways could serve as potential therapeutic targets for retinoblastoma."
"Photoreceptor cell death is the ultimate cause of vision loss in many retinal disorders, and there is an unmet need for neuroprotective modalities to improve photoreceptor survival. Similar to cancer cells, photoreceptors maintain pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) expression, which is a critical regulator in aerobic glycolysis. Unlike PKM1, which has constitutively high catalytic activity, PKM2 is under complex regulation. Recently, we demonstrated that genetically reprogramming photoreceptor metabolism via PKM2-to-PKM1 substitution is a promising neuroprotective strategy. Here, we explored the neuroprotective effects of pharmacologically activating PKM2 via ML-265, a small molecule activator of PKM2, during acute outer retinal stress. We found that ML-265 increased PKM2 activity in 661 W cells and in vivo in rat eyes without affecting the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. ML-265 treatment did, however, alter metabolic intermediates of glucose metabolism and those necessary for biosynthesis in cultured cells. Long-term exposure to ML-265 did not result in decreased photoreceptor function or survival under baseline conditions. Notably, though, ML-265-treatment did reduce entrance into the apoptotic cascade in in vitro and in vivo models of outer retinal stress. These data suggest that reprogramming metabolism via activation of PKM2 is a novel, and promising, therapeutic strategy for photoreceptor neuroprotection."
"Background/objectivesVietnam is undergoing a nutrition transition, which is leading to marked shifts in body size at the population level, but up-to-date data are lacking. We therefore quantified the prevalence of undernutrition (stunting and thinness) and overnutrition (overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity) in school-aged children in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMc), Vietnam, and compared this with previous estimates.Subjects/methodsA cross-sectional survey of 10,949 children (6–18 years old) from 30 schools in HCMc, Vietnam in 2014–2015 was used to ascertain the nutritional status of children and adolescents. Different international classification systems (WHO, IOTF, IOTF for Asian children) were used to assess the prevalence of under and overnutrition. Comparisons were made with previous surveys in HCMc.ResultsRegardless of definitions used, the prevalence of overnutrition was high, particularly in primary school children (20–30% were overweight, 20–30% were obese, and 50% had abdominal obesity), in boys, and urban children. Undernutrition was more prevalent in high-school children (8% were stunted, and 6–18% were thin, versus 2 and 2–9% in primary children, respectively), and in rural areas. Comparisons with previous surveys indicated substantial increases in overnutrition and decreased in undernutrition since 2009 in all age groups.ConclusionsOvernutrition is increasingly common in school-aged children and adolescents in HCMc, while over and undernutrition continue to coexist. These findings highlight an urgent need for greater efforts to control malnutrition in children in HCMc."
"Deregulation of mitochondrial network in terminally differentiated cells contributes to a broad spectrum of disorders. Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, due to deficiency of the mitochondrial methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase (MMUT). How MMUT deficiency triggers cell damage remains unknown, preventing the development of disease–modifying therapies. Here we combine genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that MMUT deficiency induces metabolic and mitochondrial alterations that are exacerbated by anomalies in PINK1/Parkin–mediated mitophagy, causing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that trigger epithelial stress and ultimately cell damage. Using drug–disease network perturbation modelling, we predict targetable pathways, whose modulation repairs mitochondrial dysfunctions in patient–derived cells and alleviate phenotype changes in mmut–deficient zebrafish. These results suggest a link between primary MMUT deficiency, diseased mitochondria, mitophagy dysfunction and epithelial stress, and provide potential therapeutic perspectives for MMA."
"Lack of a safe and convenient disposal method for expired and unused medications may lead to many problems such as accidental exposure, intentional misuse, and food and water contamination. Activated carbon can offer safe disposal of medications due to its highly porous structure, which exerts strong physical adsorption forces with chemicals. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of an activated carbon-based drug disposal system for deactivating three model sedative prescription medications. Deactivation was performed by mixing the medication, activated carbon, and tap water. Desorption was evaluated by exposing the deactivation system to wash-out solutions. Rapid, precise, accurate, and sensitive HPLC-UV method for each drug was successfully developed, validated and employed. Results of the 28-day deactivation study showed that on average, more than 94.00% of drugs were rapidly deactivated within 8 hours. All drugs reached more than 99.00% deactivation by the end of 28-day period. Desorption study demonstrated that all medications were retained by the system, with insignificant amount of drug (0.25%) leached into the washout solutions within 24 hours. In conclusion, activated carbon rapidly and successfully deactivated the medications tested, suggesting activated carbon-based drug disposal system provides a convenient, secure, and effective method for unused medication."
"Unnecessary antimicrobial treatment promotes the emergence of resistance. Early confirmation that a blood culture is negative could shorten antibiotic courses. The Cognitor Minus test, performed on blood culture samples after 12 hours incubation has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.5%. The aim of this study was to determine if earlier confirmation of negative blood culture result would shorten antibiotic treatment. Paired blood cultures were taken in the Critical Care Unit at a teaching hospital. The Cognitor Minus test was performed on one set >12 hours incubation but results kept blind. Clinicians were asked after 24 and 48 hours whether a result excluding bacteraemia or fungaemia would affect decisions to continue or stop antimicrobial treatment. Over 6 months, 125 patients were enrolled. The median time from start of incubation to Cognitor Minus test was 27.1 hours. When compared to 5 day blood culture results from both the control and test samples, Cognitor Minus gave NPVs of 99% and 100% respectively. Test results would have reduced antibiotic treatment in 14% (17/119) of patients at 24 and 48 hours (24% at either time) compared with routine blood culture. The availability of rapid tests to exclude bacteraemia may be of benefit in antimicrobial stewardship."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer mortality, constitutes a significant global health burden. An accurate, noninvasive detection method for CRC as complement to colonoscopy could improve the effectiveness of treatment. In the present study, SureSelectXT Methyl-Seq was performed on cancerous and normal colon tissues and CLDN1, INHBA and SLC30A10 were found as candidate methylated genes. MethyLight assay was run on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh case and control tissues to validate the methylation of the selected gene. The methylation was significantly different (p-values < 2.2e-16) with a sensitivity of 87.17%; at a specificity cut-off of 100% in FFPE tissues. Methylation studies on fresh tissues, indicated a sensitivity of 82.14% and a specificity cut-off of 92% (p-values = 1.163e-07). The biomarker performance was robust since, normal tissues indicated a significant 22.1-fold over-expression of the selected gene as compared to the corresponding CRC tissues (p-value < 2.2e-16) in the FFPE expression assay. In our plasma pilot study, evaluation of the tissue methylation marker in the circulating cell-free DNA, demonstrated that 9 out of 22 CRC samples and 20 out of 20 normal samples were identified correctly. In summary, there is a clinical feasibility that the offered methylated gene could serve as a candidate biomarker for CRC diagnostic purpose, although further exploration of our candidate gene is warranted."
"Studies indicate that stathmin expression associates with PI3K activation in breast cancer, suggesting stathmin as a marker for targetable patient subgroups. Here we assessed stathmin in relation to tumour proliferation, vascular and immune responses, BRCA1 germline status, basal-like differentiation, clinico-pathologic features, and survival. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on breast cancers from two series (cohort 1, n = 187; cohort 2, n = 198), and mass spectrometry data from 24 cases and 12 breast cancer cell lines was examined for proteomic profiles. Open databases were also explored (TCGA, METABRIC, Oslo2 Landscape cohort, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia). High stathmin expression associated with tumour proliferation, p53 status, basal-like differentiation, BRCA1 genotype, and high-grade histology. These patterns were confirmed using mRNA data. Stathmin mRNA further associated with tumour angiogenesis, immune responses and reduced survival. By logistic regression, stathmin protein independently predicted a BRCA1 genotype (OR 10.0, p = 0.015) among ER negative tumours. Cell line analysis (Connectivity Map) implied PI3K inhibition in tumours with high stathmin. Altogether, our findings indicate that stathmin might be involved in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis and immune responses in breast cancer, in addition to tumour proliferation. Cell data point to potential effects of PI3K inhibition in tumours with high stathmin expression."
"Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and 123I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with complex repeat structures and various expansions."
"BackgroundLow pH suppresses the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ cytotoxic and natural killer lymphocytes. The hypoxia-regulated transmembrane protein, carbonic anhydrase CA9, converts carbon dioxide produced by the Krebs cycle to bicarbonate and protons that acidify the extracellular milieu. We examined whether CA9 is also involved in intratumoural immunosuppression pathways.MethodsA series of 98 tissue samples of primary non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) from patients treated with surgery were analysed for the expression of CA9 and programmed-death ligand PD-L1 by cancer cells, and of FOXP3 by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).ResultsThere was no direct association of CA9 with PD-L1 expression or the density of TILs in the tumour stroma, but CA9 was directly related to the extent of FOXP3+ TIL density (p = 0.008). Double-stratification survival analysis showed that patients with high CA9 expression and low TIL score had significantly poorer survival compared with all other groups (p < 0.04). In a multivariate analysis stage (p < 0.0001, HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.3–2.7), TIL score (p = 0.05, HR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.2–1.0) was an independent prognostic variable of death events. CA9 expression by cancer cells is associated significantly with FOXP3+ regulatory T-cell abundance in the tumour stroma of NSCLC.ConclusionThe study provides a basis for testing CA9 as a marker of resistance to immune-checkpoint inhibitors and as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy."
"This study evaluated the association between the risk of events requiring ambulance services and the ambient temperature and particulate matter of 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10) for populations living in subtropical Taiwan. We used a distributed lag nonlinear model with a quasi-Poisson function to assess the roles of ambient temperature, PM10 and PM2.5 in the use of ambulance services for respiratory distress, coma and unconsciousness, chest pain, lying down in public, headaches/dizziness/vertigo/fainting/syncope and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each specific event were calculated in association with the ambient conditions. In general, the events that required ambulance services had a V-shaped or J-shaped association with the temperature, where the risks were higher at extreme temperatures. The RR of each event was significant when the patients were exposed to temperatures in the 5th percentile (<15 °C); patients with OHCA had the highest adjusted RR of 1.61 (95% CI = 1.47–1.77). The risks were also significant for coma/unconsciousness, headaches/dizziness/vertigo/fainting/syncope, and OHCA but not for respiratory distress, chest pain and lying down in public, after exposure to the 99th percentile temperatures of >30 °C. The risks for use of ambulance services increased with PM exposure and were significant for events of respiratory distress, chest pain and OHCA after exposure to the 99th percentile PM2.5 after controlling for temperatures. Events requiring ambulance services were more likely to occur when the ambient temperature was low than when it was high for the population on the subtropical island of Taiwan. The association of the risk of events requiring ambulance services with PM were not as strong as the association with low temperatures."
"Weight regain is one of the most common problems in the long-term after bariatric surgery. It is unknown if high-intensity exercise programs applied in late phases of post-surgical follow-up could counteract this trend. After a 3-year follow-up, 21 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy were randomized into an exercise group (EG, n = 11), that performed a 5-month supervised exercise program, and a control group (CG, n = 10), that followed the usual care. Body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, glycaemia and blood cholesterol were evaluated before and after the intervention. Finally, the EG repeated the evaluations 2 months after the end of the exercise program. Both groups reached their maximum weight loss at the first year after surgery and showed significant weight regain by the end of the follow-up. After the exercise program, the EG showed reductions in fat mass (−2.5 ± 2.6  kg, P < 0.05), glycaemia (−13.4 ± 8.7  mg·dL−1, P < 0.01) and blood cholesterol (−24.6 ± 29.1  mg·dL−1, P < 0.05), whereas the CG during the same period showed increases in weight (1.5 ± 1.3  kg, P < 0.05) and fat mass (1.8 ± 0.9, P < 0.01). Two months after the end of the program, EG had increases in weight (1.1 ± 1.2  kg, P < 0.05), fat mass (2.6 ± 2.2  kg, P < 0.01), glycaemia (8.2 ± 11.6  mg·dL−1, P < 0.05) and blood cholesterol (20.0 ± 22.1  mg·dL−1, P < 0.05), when compared with the values after the exercise program. Therefore, in the medium-term after sleeve gastrectomy exercise may contribute to prevent weight regain and to reduce fat mass, glycaemia, and blood cholesterol."
"ObjectiveTo compare coronary flows between premature infants with and without hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and to determine if coronary flow is influenced by medical PDA treatment.DesignProspective, observational pilot study. Forty-three infants <32 weeks gestation underwent echocardiography when routinely indicated. Study group included infants with hsPDA requiring treatment. Comparison groups included infants with nonsignificant PDA and infants without PDA.ResultsThe study group (n = 13), compared with the comparison groups with nonsignificant PDA (n = 12) and without PDA (n = 18) had higher troponin levels (p = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). In infants with hsPDA compared with infants with no PDA there was a significant increase in myocardial oxygen demand and decrease in left main coronary artery flow, with nonsignificant increase in cardiac output.ConclusionsDecrease in coronary artery flows and higher troponin values may suggest a “steal effect,” not allowing to meet the elevated myocardial oxygen demand in infants with hsPDA."
"Chemoresistance is one of the major reasons leading to ovarian cancer high mortality and poor survival. Studies have shown that the alteration of cellular autophagy is associated with cancer cell chemoresistance. Here, we investigated whether the ovarian cancer chemoresistance is associated with the autophagy induced by the inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1). By using gene overexpression or silencing, luciferase assay and human specimens, we show that ID1 induces high autophagy and confers cancer cell chemoresistance. The mechanistic study demonstrates that ID1 first activates the NF-κB signaling through facilitating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, which strengthens the expression and secretion of IL-6 from cancer cells to subsequently activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) through the protein phosphorylation at Y705. We further identified that STAT3 functions to promote the transcription of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which induces endoplasmic reticulum stress to promote cellular autophagy, granting cancer cell resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the expression of ID1 and ATF6 in 1104 high grade serous ovarian cancer tissues, and that patients with the high expression of ID1 or ATF6 were resistant to platinum treatment and had the poor overall survival and progression-free survival. Thus, we have uncovered a mechanism in which ID1 confers cancer cell chemoresistance largely through the STAT3/ATF6-induced autophagy. The involved molecules, including ID1, STAT3, and ATF6, may have a potential to be targeted in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to improve ovarian cancer survival."
"The blubber steroid hormone profiles of 52 female humpback whales migrating along the east coast of Australia were investigated for seasonal endocrine changes associated with reproduction. Individuals were randomly sampled during two stages of the annual migration: before reaching the breeding grounds (northward migration; June/July), and after departing from the breeding grounds (southward migration; September/October). Assignment of reproductive status of the sampled individuals was based on season, single-hormone ranks and multi-variate analysis of the hormonal profiles. High concentrations of progesterone (>19 ng/g, wet weight), recognised as an indicator of pregnancy in this species, were only detected in one sample. However, the androgens, testosterone and androstenedione were measured in unusually high concentrations (1.6–12 and 7.8–40 ng/g wet weight, respectively) in 36% of the females approaching the breeding grounds. The absence of a strong accompanying progesterone signal in these animals raises the possibility of progesterone withdrawal prior to parturition. As seen with other cetacean species, testosterone and androstenedione could be markers of near-term pregnancy in humpback whales. Confirmation of these androgens as alternate biomarkers of near-term pregnancy would carry implications for improved monitoring of the annual fecundity of humpback whales via non-lethal and minimally invasive methods."
"Cell survival is one of the many cellular processes regulated by Notch family of proteins. A comparison of human breast cancer cell lines, which differ in the levels of endogenous Notch4, implicated the protein in regulating susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by genomic damage. In agreement with this observation, increased susceptibility to genotoxic damage was observed following siRNA ablations of Notch4 in two breast cancer cell lines. Further, overexpressing Notch4 intracellular domain (NIC4) tagged to GFP (NIC4-GFP), protected cells from apoptosis triggered by genotoxic drugs. In cells immune-stained for endogenous Notch4, protein was detected in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, which was also confirmed by the co-localization of NIC4-GFP with RFP-tagged nucleolar proteins in breast cancer cells or the unrelated HEK cell line. Linking functional outcomes to nucleolar localization, NIC4-GFP protection from apoptosis, required the nucleolar proteins Nucleolin and Fibrillarin. Consistently, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed associations between nucleolar proteins—Nucleolin and Nucleophosmin—and Notch4. Microscopy-based biophysical analysis of live cells showed that nucleolar and nucleoplasmic pools of NIC4-GFP are mobile, with some sequestration of nucleolar NIC4-GFP pools. A nucleolar excluded form, NIC4_3RA-GFP, generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the nucleolar localization sequence in NIC4, could not protect from apoptosis triggered by genotoxic stressors. However, transcriptional activity or protection from apoptosis triggered by endoplasmic stress was comparable in cells expressing NIC4_3RA-GFP or NIC4-GFP. Together, the data show that nucleolar localization of NIC4 is critical for the regulation of genomic damage and may be uncoupled from its activities in the nucleoplasm. This study identifies intrinsic features of NIC4 that regulate signaling outcomes activated by the receptor by controlling its spatial localization."
"Acute Radiation Pneumonitis (ARP) is one of the most common dose-limiting toxicities of thoracic radiotherapy. The accurate diagnosis of ARP remains a challenge because of the lack of a rapid biomarker capable of differentiating ARP from bacterial pneumo (BP). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) in the differential diagnosis of ARP and BP. Lung cancer patients who had undergone thoracic radiotherapy within 6 months and were admitted to hospital for ARP or BP were retrospectively analyzed. The serum levels of PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells (WBC) were compared between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic value of PCT, CRP and WBC in the differential diagnosis of ARP and BP and determine the best cut-off values. One hundred eighteen patients were included. Among them, seventy-seven patients were diagnosed with ARP, and 41 patients were diagnosed with BP. The PCT concentrations for patients diagnosed with ARP group were significantly lower than those in the BP group (P < 0.001). There were no differences in CRP and WBC between the two groups. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) for PCT, CRP and WBC were 0.745, 0.589 and 0.578, respectively. The best cutoff values of PCT, CRP and WBC were 0.47 μg/L, 54.5 mg/L and 9.9 × 109/L, respectively. Low serum PCT levels are associated with ARP. PCT is a useful biomarker to distinguish ARP from BP."
"Age-related reduction in muscle force generation capacity is similarly evident across different lower limb muscle groups, yet decline in locomotor performance with age has been shown to depend primarily on reduced ankle extensor muscle function. To better understand why ageing has the largest detrimental effect on ankle joint function during locomotion, we examined maximal ankle and knee extensor force development during a two-leg hopping test in older and young men, and used these forces as a reference to calculate relative operating efforts for the knee and ankle extensors as participants walked, ran and sprinted. We found that, across locomotion modes in both age groups, ankle extensors operated at a greater relative effort compared to knee extensors; however, slightly less pronounced differences between ankle and knee extensor muscle efforts were present among older men, mainly due to a reduction in the ankle extensor force generation during locomotion modes. We consider these findings as evidence that reduced ankle push-off function in older age is driven by a tendency to keep ankle extensor effort during locomotion lower than it would otherwise be, which, in turn, may be an important self-optimisation strategy to prevent locomotor-induced fatigue of ankle extensor muscles."
"Distinguishing bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) is clinically challenging, especially during depressive episodes. While both groups are characterized by aberrant working memory and anticipatory processing, the role of these processes in discriminating BD from MDD remains unexplored. In this study, we examine how brain activation corresponding to anticipation of and performance on easy vs. difficult working memory tasks with emotional stimuli contributes to discrimination among BD, MDD, and healthy controls (HC). Depressed individuals with BD (n = 18), MDD (n = 23), and HC (n = 23) were scanned while performing a working memory task in which they had to first anticipate performance on 1-back (easy) or 2-back (difficult) tasks with happy, fearful, or neutral faces, and then, perform the task. Anticipation-related and task-related brain activation was measured in the whole brain using functional magnetic resonance imagining. We used an elastic-net regression for variable selection, and a random forest classifier for BD vs. MDD classification. The former selected the activation differences (1-back minus 2-back) in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices (PFC) during task anticipation and performance on the working memory tasks with fearful and neutral faces as variables relevant for BD vs. MDD classification. BD vs. MDD were classified with 70.7% accuracy (p < 0.01) based on the neuroimaging measures alone, with 80.5% accuracy (p = 0.001) based on clinical measures alone, and with 85.4% accuracy (p < 0.001) based on clinical and neuroimaging measures together. These findings suggest that PFC activation during working memory task anticipation and performance may be an important biological marker distinguishing BD from MDD."
"We aimed to establish a discriminative gene-expression-based classifier to predict survival outcomes of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patients. After exploring global gene-expression profiles of progressive (n = 22) vs. progression-free (n = 28) T-LBL patients, 43 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. Then an eleven-gene-based classifier was established using LASSO Cox regression based on NanoString quantification. In the training cohort (n = 169), high-risk patients stratified using the classifier had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: hazards ratio 4.123, 95% CI 2.565–6.628; p < 0.001), disease-free survival (DFS: HR 3.148, 95% CI 1.857–5.339; p < 0.001), and overall survival (OS: HR 3.790, 95% CI 2.237–6.423; p < 0.001) compared with low-risk patients. The prognostic accuracy of the classifier was validated in the internal testing (n = 84) and independent validation cohorts (n = 360). A prognostic nomogram consisting of five independent variables including the classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, ECOG-PS, central nervous system involvement, and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed significantly greater prognostic accuracy than each single variable alone. The addition of a five-miRNA-based signature further enhanced the accuracy of this nomogram. Furthermore, patients with a nomogram score ≥154.2 significantly benefited from the BFM protocol. In conclusion, our nomogram comprising the 11-gene-based classifier may make contributions to individual prognosis prediction and treatment decision-making."
"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and one of its endogenous ligands myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8 or S100A8), especially expressed in macrophages, play an important role in diabetic nephropathy and autoimmune disorders. However, detailed mechanisms and consequence of MRP8 expression remain unknown, partly due to embryonic lethality of MRP8 knockout mice. In this study, Myeloid lineage cell-specific MRP8 knockout mice were generated, and nephrotoxic serum-induced glomerulonephritis was developed. Mice with conditional ablation of MRP8 gene in myeloid cells exhibited less severe histological damage, proteinuria and inflammatory changes compared to control mice. Mechanism of MRP8 upregulation was investigated using cultured cells. Co-culture of macrophages with mesangial cells or mesangial cell-conditioned media, but not with proximal tubules, markedly upregulated MRP8 gene expression and inflammatory M1 phenotype in macrophages, which was attenuated in MRP8-deleted bone marrow-derived macrophages. Effects of MRP8 deletion was further studied in the context of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle), which is critically involved in maintenance of M1 phenotype of macrophages. MRP8 ablation in myeloid cells suppressed the induction of Mincle expression on macrophages in glomerulonephritis. Thus, we propose that intraglomerular crosstalk between mesangial cells and macrophages plays a role in inflammatory changes in glomerulonephritis, and MRP8-dependent Mincle expression in macrophage may be involved in the process."
"Changes in human gait resulting from ageing or neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial. Here we assess the effects of age and Parkinson’s disease (PD) on corticospinal activity recorded during treadmill and overground walking. Electroencephalography (EEG) from 10 electrodes and electromyography (EMG) from bilateral tibialis anterior muscles were acquired from 22 healthy young, 24 healthy older and 20 adults with PD. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG during the double-support phase of the gait cycle. CMC and EMG power at low beta frequencies (13–21 Hz) was significantly decreased in older and PD participants compared to young people, but there was no difference between older and PD groups. Older and PD participants spent shorter time in the swing phase than young individuals. These findings indicate age-related changes in the temporal coordination of gait. The decrease in low-beta CMC suggests reduced cortical input to spinal motor neurons in older people during the double-support phase. We also observed multiple changes in electrophysiological measures at low-gamma frequencies during treadmill compared to overground walking, indicating task-dependent differences in corticospinal locomotor control. These findings may be affected by artefacts and should be interpreted with caution."
"The recommended antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related clinical manifestations of adverse events (AEs) related to NAIs. FAERS and WebMD data were downloaded. The available NAIs selected for the analysis were oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the information component (IC) methods. In total, 16729 AEs from 4598 patients and 575 AEs from 440 patients in the FAERS and WebMD, respectively, were included in the analysis. In the FAERS, AEs were more common among those who were younger (<19 years) for zanamivir, while for those who were older (>65 years) for peramivir. A disproportionality analysis showed that signals for vomiting and hallucinations were detected in younger patients given oseltamivir, while an abnormal hepatic function, cardiac failure, shock, and cardio-respiratory arrest were detected in older patients given peramivir. Psychiatric disorders were most common in younger and older patients, while gastrointestinal disorders were most common in adult given oseltamivir in the WebMD. Adverse symptoms related to NAIs varied and depended on the drugs used and the age of the patient."
"The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 is a long-sought goal. We previously reported the amino-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP8) – when conjugated to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) – to be capable of inducing broadly neutralizing responses against HIV-1 in animal models. However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice. Overall, SIAB-linked FP8-rTTHC appears to be a promising vaccine candidate for advancing to clinical assessment."
"Epigenetic reprogramming in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) leads to the aberrant activation of super enhancer (SE) landscapes that drive the expression of key oncogenes, including the oncogenic MYC pathway. These SEs have been identified as promising therapeutic targets, and have given rise to a new class of drugs, including BET protein inhibitors, which center on targeting SE activity. NR4A nuclear receptors are tumor suppressors of AML that function in part through transcriptional repression of the MYC-driven oncogenic program via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here we show that NR4A1, and the NR4A inducing drug dihydroergotamine (DHE), regulate overlapping gene expression programs in AML and repress transcription of a subset of SE-associated leukemic oncogenes, including MYC. NR4As interact with an AML-selective SE cluster that governs MYC transcription and decommissions its activation status by dismissing essential SE-bound coactivators including BRD4, Mediator and p300, leading to loss of p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation and Pol 2-dependent eRNA transcription. DHE shows similar efficacy to the BET inhibitor JQ1 at repressing SE-dependent MYC expression and AML growth in mouse xenografts. Thus, DHE induction of NR4As provides an alternative strategy to BET inhibitors to target MYC dependencies via suppression of the AML-selective SE governing MYC expression."
"LncRNAs have been shown to be direct players in chromatin regulation, but little is known about their role at active genomic loci. We investigate the role of lncRNAs in gene activation by profiling the RNA interactome of SMARCB1-containing SWI/SNF complexes in proliferating and senescent conditions. The isolation of SMARCB1-associated transcripts, together with chromatin profiling, shows prevalent association to active regions where SMARCB1 differentially binds locally transcribed RNAs. We identify SWINGN, a lncRNA interacting with SMARCB1 exclusively in proliferating conditions, exerting a pro-oncogenic role in some tumor types. SWINGN is transcribed from an enhancer and modulates the activation of GAS6 oncogene as part of a topologically organized region, as well as a larger network of pro-oncogenic genes by favoring SMARCB1 binding. Our results indicate that SWINGN influences the ability of the SWI/SNF complexes to drive epigenetic activation of specific promoters, suggesting a SWI/SNF-RNA cooperation to achieve optimal transcriptional activation."
"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an important pathogen that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. hMPV has two major genotypes, hMPV-A and hMPV-B. Epidemiological studies have shown that the two hMPV genotypes alternate in predominance worldwide in recent years. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them, such as competitive replication, which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice, genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However, genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study, which were evaluated by the body weight, airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model, competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary, we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B, and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes. This study shows a new insight to understand the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through genotype competition and provide experimental evidence for disease control and vaccine design."
"Human foodborne infections with the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni are on the rise and constitute a significant socioeconomic burden worldwide. The health-beneficial, particularly anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin C (ascorbate) are well known. In our preclinical intervention study, we assessed potential anti-pathogenic and immunomodulatory effects of ascorbate in C. jejuni-infected secondary abiotic IL-10−/− mice developing acute campylobacteriosis similar to humans. Starting 4 days prior peroral C. jejuni-infection, mice received synthetic ascorbate via the drinking water until the end of the experiment. At day 6 post-infection, ascorbate-treated mice harbored slightly lower colonic pathogen loads and suffered from less severe C. jejuni-induced enterocolitis as compared to placebo control animals. Ascorbate treatment did not only alleviate macroscopic sequelae of infection, but also dampened apoptotic and inflammatory immune cell responses in the intestines that were accompanied by less pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Remarkably, the anti-inflammatory effects of ascorbate pretreatment in C. jejuni-infected mice were not restricted to the intestinal tract but could also be observed in extra-intestinal compartments including liver, kidneys and lungs. In conclusion, due to the potent anti-inflammatory effects observed in the clinical murine C. jejuni-infection model, ascorbate constitutes a promising novel option for prophylaxis and treatment of acute campylobacteriosis."
"Lower extremity skeletal muscle mass (LESM) in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has been linked to adverse clinical events, but it is not known whether it is associated with cognitive difficulties. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 1,235 people (mean age 61.4 ± 8.0 years) with T2D under primary and secondary care in Singapore. Bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) measures of upper extremity skeletal muscle mass (UESM), LESM and appendicular skeletal muscle index (SMI) were related to the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) measures of cognition, in multiple linear regression. In multivariable models, tertile 1 LESM (b = −2.62 (−3.92 to −1.32)) and tertile 2 LESM (b = −1.73 (−2.73 to −0.73)), referenced to tertile 3) were significantly associated with decreased RBANS total score. Significant associations of LESM with cognitive domain performances were observed for tertile 1 (b = −3.75 (−5.98 to −1.52)) and tertile 2 (b = −1.98 (−3.69 to −0.27)) with immediate memory, and for tertile 1 (b = −3.05 (−4.86 to −1.24)) and tertile 2 (b = −1.87 (−3.25 to −0.48)) with delayed memory, and for tertile 1 (b = −2.99 (−5.30 to −0.68)) with visuospatial/constructional ability. Tertile 1 SMI (b = −1.94 (−3.79 to −0.08) and tertile 2 SMI (b = −1.75 (−3.14 to −0.37)) were also associated with delayed memory. There were no associations between UESM with cognitive performance. Lower LESM may be a useful marker of possible co-occuring cognitive dysfunction."
"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) are gut-derived peptide hormones known to play important roles in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion, appetite, and food intake. We have previously demonstrated that both GLP-1 and CCK are produced in the endocrine pancreas of obese mice. Interestingly, while GLP-1 is well known to stimulate insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, direct evidence of CCK promoting insulin release in human islets remains to be determined. Here, we tested whether islet-derived GLP-1 or CCK is necessary for the full stimulation of insulin secretion. We confirm that mouse pancreatic islets secrete GLP-1 and CCK, but only GLP-1 acts locally within the islet to promote insulin release ex vivo. GLP-1 is exclusively produced in approximately 50% of α-cells in lean mouse islets and 70% of α-cells in human islets, suggesting a paracrine α to β-cell signaling through the β-cell GLP-1 receptor. Additionally, we provide evidence that islet CCK expression is regulated by glucose, but its receptor signaling is not required during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We also see no increase in GSIS in response to CCK peptides. Importantly, all these findings were confirmed in islets from non-diabetic human donors. In summary, our data suggest no direct role for CCK in stimulating insulin secretion and highlight the critical role of intra-islet GLP-1 signaling in the regulation of human β-cell function."
"Purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of T1 relaxation time (T1) for differentiating prostate cancer (PCa) from benign tissue as well as high- from low-grade PCa. Twenty-three patients with suspicion for PCa were included in this prospective study. 3 T MRI including a Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence was acquired. Subsequent targeted and systematic prostate biopsy served as a reference standard. T1 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in PCa and reference regions without malignancy as well as high- and low-grade PCa were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The performance of T1, ADC value, and a combination of both to differentiate PCa and reference regions was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. T1 and ADC value were lower in PCa compared to reference regions in the peripheral and transition zone (p < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed high AUCs for T1 (0.92; 95%-CI, 0.87–0.98) and ADC value (0.97; 95%-CI, 0.94 to 1.0) when differentiating PCa and reference regions. A combination of T1 and ADC value yielded an even higher AUC. The difference was statistically significant comparing it to the AUC for ADC value alone (p = 0.02). No significant differences were found between high- and low-grade PCa for T1 (p = 0.31) and ADC value (p = 0.8). T1 relaxation time differs significantly between PCa and benign prostate tissue with lower T1 in PCa. It could represent an imaging biomarker for PCa."
"Intrinsic malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastomas are frequently resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with few hypermutated glioblastomas showing response. Modeling patient-individual resistance is challenging due to the lack of predictive biomarkers and limited accessibility of tissue for serial biopsies. Here, we investigate resistance mechanisms to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy in syngeneic hypermutated experimental gliomas and show a clear dichotomy and acquired immune heterogeneity in ICB-responder and non-responder tumors. We made use of this dichotomy to establish a radiomic signature predicting tumor regression after pseudoprogression induced by ICB therapy based on serial magnetic resonance imaging. We provide evidence that macrophage-driven ICB resistance is established by CD4 T cell suppression and Treg expansion in the tumor microenvironment via the PD-L1/PD-1/CD80 axis. These findings uncover an unexpected heterogeneity of response to ICB in strictly syngeneic tumors and provide a rationale for targeting PD-L1-expressing tumor-associated macrophages to overcome resistance to ICB."
"Sepsis is associated with exacerbated inflammatory response which subsequently results in multiple organ dysfunction. Sepsis accounts for high mortality and morbidity among newborns worldwide. Narciclasine is a plant alkaloid which has shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we investigated the effect and mechanism of action of narciclasine in neonatal sepsis rat models. The excessive release of S100A8/A9 or calprotectin in neonatal sepsis could be detrimental as it could exacerbate the inflammatory responses. We found that narciclasine significantly reduced the plasma levels of S100A8/A9 and also suppressed its expression in the liver and lung. The systemic and local bacterial load was also reduced in the narciclasine treated rats. The systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma and organs (liver and lungs) was significantly reduced in the narciclasine treated rats. The histopathological studies showed that narciclasine prevents the organ damage associated with sepsis and improved the survival of neonatal rats. Sepsis increased the phosphorylated NF-κβ p65 protein expression in the liver. Narciclasine suppressed the phosphorylation of NF-κβ p65 and the degradation of NF-κβ inhibitory protein alpha. It could also suppress the expression of adaptor proteins of the toll like receptor signaling pathway viz., myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). These results suggest that narciclasine protects against sepsis in neonatal rats through the inhibition of calprotectin, pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of NF-κβ signaling pathway."
"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a type of neurological autoimmune disease characterized by attacks of CNS inflammation that are often severe and predominantly affect the spinal cord and optic nerve. The majority of individuals with NMOSD are women, many of whom are of childbearing age. Although NMOSD are rare, several small retrospective studies and case reports have indicated that pregnancy can worsen disease activity and might contribute to disease onset. NMOSD disease activity seems to negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, some of the current NMOSD treatments are known to pose risks to the developing fetus and only limited safety data are available for others. Here, we review published studies regarding the relationship between pregnancy outcomes and NMOSD disease activity. We also assess the risks associated with using disease-modifying therapies for NMOSD during the course of pregnancy and breastfeeding. On the basis of the available evidence, we offer recommendations regarding the use of these therapies in the course of pregnancy planning in individuals with NMOSD."
"Eliciting protective titers of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development, but current vaccine strategies have yet to induce bnAbs in humans. Many bnAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals are encoded by immunoglobulin gene rearrangments with infrequent naive B cell precursors and with unusual genetic features that may be subject to host regulatory control. Here, we administer antibodies targeting immune cell regulatory receptors CTLA-4, PD-1 or OX40 along with HIV envelope (Env) vaccines to rhesus macaques and bnAb immunoglobulin knock-in (KI) mice expressing diverse precursors of CD4 binding site HIV-1 bnAbs. CTLA-4 blockade augments HIV-1 Env antibody responses in macaques, and in a bnAb-precursor mouse model, CTLA-4 blocking or OX40 agonist antibodies increase germinal center B and T follicular helper cells and plasma neutralizing antibodies. Thus, modulation of CTLA-4 or OX40 immune checkpoints during vaccination can promote germinal center activity and enhance HIV-1 Env antibody responses."
"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles which are released from healthy and tumor cells into blood circulation. Unique biomolecular cargos such as RNA and protein are loaded in these vesicles. These molecules may have biological functions such as signaling, cell communications and have the potential to be analyzed as biomarkers. In this initial study, we describe the analysis of exosomes in the serum of healthy subjects, intraductal papillary mucosal neoplasms and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma including the characterization of their RNA cargos by next generation sequencing (EXO-NGS). Results indicate the presence of a wide variety of RNAs including mRNA, miRNA, lincRNA, tRNA and piRNA in these vesicles. Based on the differential mRNA expression observed upon EXO-NGS analysis, we independently evaluated two protein coding genes, matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) and transcription factor T-Box 3 (TBX3) by qRT-PCR for selective expression in the serum samples. Results indicate a variable expression pattern of these genes across serum samples between different study groups. Further, qRT-PCR analysis with the same serum exosomes processed for EXO-NGS, we observed two long non-coding RNAs, malat-1 and CRNDE to be variably expressed. Overall, our observations emphasize the potential value of different exosome components in distinguishing between healthy, premalignant and malignant conditions related to the pancreas."
"Myxofibrosarcoma(MFS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma(STS) in elderly patients. Surgical resection remains the main treatment modality but tumor borders can be difficult to delineate with conventional clinical methods. Incomplete resections are a common problem and local recurrence remains a clinical issue. A technique that has shown great potential in improving surgical treatment of solid tumors is tumor targeted imaging and image-guided surgery with near-infrared fluorescence. To facilitate this technique, it is essential to identify a biomarker that is highly and homogenously expressed on tumor cells, while being absent on healthy non-malignant tissue. The purpose of this study was to identify suitable molecular targets for tumor-targeted imaging of myxofibrosarcoma. Ten potential molecular targets for tumor targeted imaging were investigated with immunohistochemical analysis in myxofibrosarcoma tissue (n = 34). Results were quantified according to the immunoreactive score(IRS). Moderate expression rates were found for uPAR, PDGFRa and EMA/MUC1. High expression rates of VEGF and TEM1 were seen. Strong expression was most common for TEM1 (88.2%). These results confirms that TEM1 is a suitable target for tumor-targeted imaging of myxofibrosarcoma.

"Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring is a set of monitoring techniques consisting of reading electrical activity generated by the nervous system structures during surgeries. In order to guarantee signal quality, contact impedance between the sensing electrodes and the patient’s skin needs to be as low as possible. Hence, monitoring this impedance while signals are measured is an important feature of current medical devices. The most commonly used technique involves injection of a known current and measurement of the voltage drop in the contact interface. This method poses several problems, such as power consumption (critical in battery-powered systems), frequency dependency and regulation issues, which are overcome by using a passive method. The fundamentals of the method proposed in this paper are based on the utilization of the variation suffered by the input random signal when a known resistance is connected in parallel to the input terminals of the low-noise amplifier (LNA) of the analog front-end of the acquisition system. Controlling the connection of the resistors and computing the root mean square of the LNA output voltage has been proved to be a useful tool to assess that the contact impedance is suitably low, allowing the user to know if the neural measurements obtained are valid."
"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) repeat acute exacerbations (AE). Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) is only available for patients in stable phase. Currently, there is a lack of assessment and prediction methods for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) patients during hospitalization. To enhance the monitoring and treatment of AECOPD patients, we develop a novel C5.0 decision tree classifier to predict the prognosis of AECOPD hospitalized patients with objective clinical indicators. The medical records of 410 hospitalized AECOPD patients are collected and 28 features including vital signs, medical history, comorbidities and various inflammatory indicators are selected. The overall accuracy of the proposed C5.0 decision tree classifier is 80.3% (65 out of 81 participants) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI):(0.6991, 0.8827) and Kappa 0.6054. In addition, the performance of the model constructed by C5.0 exceeds the C4.5, classification and regression tree (CART) model and the iterative dichotomiser 3 (ID3) model. The C5.0 decision tree classifier helps respiratory physicians to assess the severity of the patient early, thereby guiding the treatment strategy and improving the prognosis of patients."
"Serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC) is more invasive, has worse outcomes than conventional colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and is characterized by frequent resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and overexpression of fascin1, a key protein in actin bundling that plays a causative role in tumor invasion and is overexpressed in different cancer types with poor prognosis. In silico screening of 9591 compounds, including 2037 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was performed, and selected compounds were analyzed for their fascin1 binding affinity by differential scanning fluorescence. The results were compared with migrastatin as a typical fascin1 inhibitor. In silico screening and differential scanning fluorescence yielded the FDA-approved antidepressant imipramine as the most evident potential fascin1 blocker. Biophysical and different in vitro actin-bundling assays confirm this activity. Subsequent assays investigating lamellipodia formation and migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells in vitro using 3D human tissue demonstrated anti-fascin1 and anti-invasive activities of imipramine. Furthermore, expression profiling suggests the activity of imipramine on the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, in vivo studies using a zebrafish invasion model showed that imipramine is tolerated, its anti-invasive and antimetastatic activities are dose-dependent, and it is associated with both constitutive and induced fascin1 expression. This is the first study that demonstrates an antitumoral role of imipramine as a fascin1 inhibitor and constitutes a foundation for a molecular targeted therapy for SAC and other fascin1-overexpressing tumors."
"The experimental approach for the study of cardiometabolic disorders requires the use of animal models fed with commercial diets whose composition differs notably, even between diets used for control groups. While chow diets are usually made of agricultural by-products, purified low-fat diets (LF) contain a higher percentage of easy metabolizable carbohydrates, together with a reduced amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids, micronutrients and fiber, all associated with metabolic and vascular dysfunction. We hypothesize that the LF diet, commonly used in control animals, could promote adverse vascular and metabolic outcomes. To address this issue, 5-week-old male C57BL6J mice were fed with a standard (Chow) or a LF diet for 6 weeks. Changes in body weight, adiposity, biochemical parameters, systemic and aortic insulin sensitivity and endothelial function were recorded. LF diet did not modify body weight but significantly impaired systemic glucose tolerance and increased triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Endothelial function and aortic insulin sensitivity were significantly impaired in the LF group, due to a reduction of NO availability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting the proper control diet in metabolic studies. It may also suggest that some cardiometabolic alterations obtained in experimental studies using LF as a control diet may be underestimated."
"Treatment of haematological disorders in patients with chronic hepatitis B or resolved infection (anti-HBc-positive) is associated with a risk of hepatitis B reactivation. Moreover, patients with chronic hepatitis C have a higher risk of haematological malignancies than general population. An electronic alert system was developed to promote screening of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) in patients starting haematological therapies. The system included screening and linkage to care and a request for testing in those without data. From March, 2017 to March, 2018 data from 420 consecutive patients with haematological diseases were included. At first prescription before the alerts, the HCV and HBV screening rate was 60.5%. Following the alerts, an additional 115 were screened, increasing the overall screening rate to 87.9%. Anti-HBc alone was detected in 57, anti-HCV in 13, and HBsAg in 2 patients. Overall, 68% of patients with any viral hepatitis markers were previously not know, and the impact was particularly important for anti-HBc detection (47/57 unknown). Nucleoside analogues were prescribed in 28 (49.1%) anti-HBc-positive and the 2 HBsAg-positive patients. Prospective follow-up with HBV DNA and HBsAg testing showed no cases of HBV reactivation. An estimated 1.2 HBV reactivations were avoided as consequence of the alert system. In summary, an electronic alert system increased viral hepatitis screening in patients receiving haematological treatment and led to improvements in the management of these patients, including avoided HBV reactivation."
"Endemic disease transmission is an important ecological process that is challenging to study because of low occurrence rates. Here, we investigate the ecological drivers of two coral diseases–growth anomalies and tissue loss–affecting five coral species. We first show that a statistical framework called the case-control study design, commonly used in epidemiology but rarely applied to ecology, provided high predictive accuracy (67–82%) and disease detection rates (60–83%) compared with a traditional statistical approach that yielded high accuracy (98–100%) but low disease detection rates (0–17%). Using this framework, we found evidence that 1) larger corals have higher disease risk; 2) shallow reefs with low herbivorous fish abundance, limited water motion, and located adjacent to watersheds with high fertilizer and pesticide runoff promote low levels of growth anomalies, a chronic coral disease; and 3) wave exposure, stream exposure, depth, and low thermal stress are associated with tissue loss disease risk during interepidemic periods. Variation in risk factors across host-disease pairs suggests that either different pathogens cause the same gross lesions in different species or that the same disease may arise in different species under different ecological conditions."
"Knowledge about the difference in the global distribution of pathogens and non-pathogens is limited. Here, we investigate it using a multi-sample metagenomics phylogeny approach based on short-read metagenomic sequencing of sewage from 79 sites around the world. For each metagenomic sample, bacterial template genomes were identified in a non-redundant database of whole genome sequences. Reads were mapped to the templates identified in each sample. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each template identified in multiple samples. The countries from which the samples were taken were grouped according to different definitions of world regions. For each tree, the tendency for regional clustering was determined. Phylogenetic trees representing 95 unique bacterial templates were created covering 4 to 71 samples. Varying degrees of regional clustering could be observed. The clustering was most pronounced for environmental bacterial species and human commensals, and less for colonizing opportunistic pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and pathogens. No pattern of significant difference in clustering between any of the organism classifications and country groupings according to income were observed. Our study suggests that while the same bacterial species might be found globally, there is a geographical regional selection or barrier to spread for individual clones of environmental and human commensal bacteria, whereas this is to a lesser degree the case for strains and clones of human pathogens and opportunistic pathogens."
"Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects ~1% of the world population. In total 5−10% of ID cases are due to variants in genes located on the X chromosome. Recently, variants in OGT have been shown to co-segregate with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in multiple families. OGT encodes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), an essential enzyme that catalyses O-linked glycosylation with β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on serine/threonine residues of thousands of nuclear and cytosolic proteins. In this review, we compile the work from the last few years that clearly delineates a new syndromic form of ID, which we propose to classify as a novel Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (OGT-CDG). We discuss potential hypotheses for the underpinning molecular mechanism(s) that provide impetus for future research studies geared towards informed interventions."
"ObjectiveWe sought a shortened MOTHER neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and Finnegan score that would retain comparable performance characteristics of the full instrument.Study designRetrospective cohort.ResultsIn total, 124,170 MOTHER NAS scores between August 2007 and May 2016 from 775 infants (≥36 weeks) were examined. Classification and regression tree model identified the most important subsets of the scored variables. A 9-element shortened scale yielded >90% sensitivity and specificity to predict clinical endpoints based on the full 19-element MOTHER NAS score. Conversion of the data sets to the Finnegan score, and applying the same procedure resulted in a nine-element score with similar performance characteristics.ConclusionShortened scoring instruments were identified with the high-predictive power for clinical endpoints based on the 19-element full MOTHER NAS score. There was no substantial variation in performance for age, supporting the current practice of utilizing a single scoring tool regardless of postnatal age."
"Mechanisms of neuroimmune and mitochondrial dysfunction have been repeatedly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To examine these mechanisms in ASD individuals, we measured the in vivo expression of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), an activated glial marker expressed on mitochondrial membranes. Participants underwent scanning on a simultaneous magnetic resonance–positron emission tomography (MR–PET) scanner with the second-generation TSPO radiotracer [11C]PBR28. By comparing TSPO in 15 young adult males with ASD with 18 age- and sex-matched controls, we showed that individuals with ASD exhibited lower regional TSPO expression in several brain regions, including the bilateral insular cortex, bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral temporal, angular, and supramarginal gyri, which have previously been implicated in autism in functional MR imaging studies. No brain region exhibited higher regional TSPO expression in the ASD group compared with the control group. A subset of participants underwent a second MR–PET scan after a median interscan interval of 3.6 months, and we determined that TSPO expression over this period of time was stable and replicable. Furthermore, voxelwise analysis confirmed lower regional TSPO expression in ASD at this later time point. Lower TSPO expression in ASD could reflect abnormalities in neuroimmune processes or mitochondrial dysfunction."
"Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (UQCRB), a subunit of the mitochondrial complex III, is highly expressed in tissues from colorectal cancer patients. Since UQCRB is highly expressed in colorectal cancer, we investigated miRNAs from mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines to identify new miRNA biomarkers. After sequencing miRNAs in the mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines, miR-4435 was selected as a potential biomarker candidate from the six up-regulated miRNAs. The expression level of miR-4435 in the mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines and colon cancer was increased. Notably, the expression level of miR-4435 was increased in exosomes isolated from cell culture medium, suggesting that miR-4435 is closely related to colon cancer and that large amounts of miR-4435 may be secreted outside of the cells through exosomes. Additionally, exosomes extracted from the serum samples of colorectal cancer patients showed increased miR-4435 levels depending on the cancer progression stage. Moreover, analyses of a miRNA database and mRNA-sequencing data of the mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines revealed that TIMP3, a tumor suppressor, could be a target of miR-4435. Additionally, the expression of miR-4435 was suppressed by UQCRB inhibitor treatment whereas TIMP3 was up-regulated. Upregulation of TIMP3 decreased proliferation of the mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines and a colorectal cancer cell line. TIMP3 was also upregulated in response to miR-4435 inhibitor and UQCRB inhibitor treatments. Furthermore, these findings suggest that miR-4435 is related to an oncogenic function in UQCRB related disease, CRC, and that effects migration and invasion on mutant UQCRB-expressing cell lines and colorectal cancer cell. In conclusion, our results identified miR-4435 as a potential circulating miRNA biomarker of colorectal cancer associated with UQCRB."
"Mosquito-borne diseases like malaria are a major public health problem in tropical countries, such as Madagascar. Female Anopheles mosquito vectors the human malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and is important indicator in malaria surveillance activities. Among the various means of vector control in Madagascar, the use of attractants for mass trapping of target species could be an alternative to insecticides. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether 4-hydroxycoumarin can be used as an attractant for anthropophilic Anopheles spp. vectors of malaria. For this, a field study was conducted using CDC light traps in the village of Ambohidray, Madagascar. 16 days of trapping was conducted and four replicates nights were performed for each product tested. 4-hydroxycoumarin, octenol and two types of blend of these products were tested. The results showed that 4-hydroxycoumarin (2 mg) have a significant attractive effect on Anopheles spp. and significant selectivity towards Anopheles gambiae s.l, and Anopheles mascarensis which are both significant malaria vectors in Madagascar. A synergy of 4-hydroxycoumarin with octenol was found to attract these mosquito vectors. A significant decrease in vector populations was observed during this experiment. These results suggest that 4-hydroxycoumarin could be useful for malaria surveillance and the control of vector populations."
"BackgroundDrug resistance remains as one of the major challenges in melanoma therapy. It is well known that tumour cells undergo phenotypic switching during melanoma progression, increasing melanoma plasticity and resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MAPKi).MethodsWe investigated the melanoma phenotype switching using a partial reprogramming model to de-differentiate murine melanoma cells and target melanoma therapy adaptation against MAPKi.ResultsHere, we show that partially reprogrammed cells are a less proliferative and more de-differentiated cell population, expressing a gene signature for stemness and suppressing melanocyte-specific markers. To investigate adaptation to MAPKi, cells were exposed to B-Raf Proto-Oncogene (BRAF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. De-differentiated cells became less sensitive to MAPKi, showed increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis. Furthermore, T-type calcium channels expression increased in adaptive murine cells and in human adaptive melanoma cells. Treatment with the calcium channel blocker mibefradil induced cell death, differentiation and susceptibility to MAPKi in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionIn summary, we show that partial reprogramming of melanoma cells induces de-differentiation and adaptation to MAPKi. Moreover, we postulated a calcium channel blocker such as mibefradil, as a potential candidate to restore sensitivity to MAPKi in adaptive melanoma cells."
"Injury of the tooth pulp is excruciatingly painful and yet the receptors and neural circuit mechanisms that transmit this form of pain remain poorly defined in both the clinic and preclinical rodent models. Easily quantifiable behavioral assessment in the mouse orofacial area remains a major bottleneck in uncovering molecular mechanisms that govern inflammatory pain in the tooth. In this study we sought to address this problem using the Mouse Grimace Scale and a novel approach to the application of mechanical Von Frey hair stimuli. We use a dental pulp injury model that exposes the pulp to the outside environment, a procedure we have previously shown produces inflammation. Using RNAscope technology, we demonstrate an upregulation of genes that contribute to the pain state in the trigeminal ganglia of injured mice. We found that mice with dental pulp injury have greater Mouse Grimace Scores than sham within 24 hours of injury, suggestive of spontaneous pain. We developed a scoring system of mouse refusal to determine thresholds for mechanical stimulation of the face with Von Frey filaments. This method revealed that mice with a unilateral dental injury develop bilateral mechanical allodynia that is delayed relative to the onset of spontaneous pain. This work demonstrates that tooth pain can be quantified in freely behaving mice using approaches common for other types of pain assessment. Harnessing these assays in the orofacial area during gene manipulation should assist in uncovering mechanisms for tooth pulp inflammatory pain and other forms of trigeminal pain."
"Our aim was to determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a nation-wide population based cohort from Spain (di@bet.es study). The target was the Spanish population. In total 5072 people older than 18 years,were randomly selected from all over Spain). Socio-demographic and clinical data, survey on habits (physical activity and food consumption) and weight, height, waist, hip and blood pressure were recorder. A fasting blood draw and an oral glucose tolerance test were performed. Determinations of serum glucose were made. In the follow-up the same variables were collected and HbA1c was determined. A total of 2408 subjects participated in the follow-up. In total, 154 people developed diabetes (6.4% cumulative incidence in 7.5 years of follow-up). The incidence of diabetes adjusted for the structure of age and sex of the Spanish population was 11.6 cases/1000 person-years (IC95% = 11.1–12.1). The incidence of known diabetes was 3.7 cases/1000 person-years (IC95% = 2.8–4.6). The main risk factors for developing diabetes were the presence of prediabetes in cross-sectional study, age, male sex, obesity, central obesity, increase in weight, and family history of diabetes. This work provides data about population-based incidence rates of diabetes and associated risk factors in a nation-wide cohort of Spanish population."
"The Bcl-xL apoptosis inhibitor plays a major role in vertebrate development. In addition to its effect on apoptosis, Bcl-xL is also involved in cell migration and mitochondrial metabolism. These effects may favour the onset and dissemination of metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Here we focus on the control of cell migration by Bcl-xL in the context of breast cancer cells. We show that Bcl-xL silencing led to migration defects in Hs578T and MDA-MB231 cells. These defects were rescued by re-expressing mitochondria-addressed, but not endoplasmic reticulum-addressed, Bcl-xL. The use of BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-737 and WEHI-539 confirmed that the effect of Bcl-xL on migration did not depend on interactions with BH3-containing death accelerators such as Bax or BH3-only proteins. In contrast, the use of a BH4 peptide that disrupts the Bcl-xL/VDAC1 complex supports that Bcl-xL by acting on VDAC1 permeability contributes to cell migration through the promotion of reactive oxygen species production by the electron transport chain. Collectively our data highlight the key role of Bcl-xL at the interface between cell metabolism, cell death, and cell migration, thus exposing the VDAC1/Bcl-xL interaction as a promising target for anti-tumour therapy in the context of metastatic breast cancer."
"Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment promotes early recovery from muscle injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) upregulation is a key mechanism of HBO, which produces high O2 content in tissues through increased dissolution of oxygen at high pressure. Nitric oxide (NO), a type of ROS, generally stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α and stimulates secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from endothelial cells and macrophages, which then induces angiogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether HBO could promote angiogenesis via induction of NO and induce muscle regeneration in contused rat skeletal muscles. The HBO protocol consisted of 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) 100% oxygen for 120 minutes, once a day for 5 consecutive days. We also evaluated the effects of a ROS inhibitor (NAC) or NOS-specific inhibitor (L-NAME) on HBO. HBO significantly increased NO3−, VEGF, and bFGF levels and stabilized HIF1α within 1 day. HBO promoted blood vessel formation at 3–7 days and muscle healing at 5–7 days after contusion. Administration of both NAC and L-NAME before HBO suppressed angiogenesis and muscle regeneration even after HBO. HBO thus promoted angiogenesis and muscle regeneration mainly through generation of NO in the early phase after muscle contusion injury."
"BackgroundPreclinical studies have shown both pro- and antineoplastic effects of antihistamines. Here, we evaluated the effect of H1 antihistamines on contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk, and whether cationic amphiphilic (CAD) antihistamines could increase the sensitivity to chemotherapy.MethodsFrom the Danish Breast Cancer Group clinical database, we identified all women aged ≥20 years with a first-time diagnosis of breast cancer during 1996–2012. Information on drug use, CBC and potential confounding factors was retrieved from nationwide registries. Using Cox proportional hazard regression models, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CBC associated with H1-antihistamine use.ResultsWe identified 52,723 patients with breast cancer with a total of 310,583 person-years of follow-up. Among them, 1444 patients developed a new primary tumour in the contralateral breast. Post-diagnosis use of H1 antihistamines (≥2 prescriptions) was not strongly associated with CBC risk (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.90–1.31) compared with non-use (<2 prescriptions). Use of CAD antihistamines among patients receiving chemotherapy was not associated with a decrease in CBC risk.ConclusionsTaken together, our findings do not suggest any association of H1-antihistamine use with CBC development."
"The presence of advanced fibrosis is an important measure of the severity of chronic liver disease. Prior works that have examined the gut microbiome as a novel biomarker for advanced fibrosis have only examined patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, our goal was to examine the gut microbiome across varying etiologies of liver disease to create a predictive model for liver fibrosis based upon a microbial signature. Stool samples were obtained from patients with chronic liver disease (n = 50) undergoing FibroScan (ultrasound elastography) at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Healthy control patients (n = 25) were also recruited as a reference population. Fecal samples underwent 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Using differentially abundant microbes, a random forest classifier model was created to distinguish advanced fibrosis from mild/moderate fibrosis. The findings were then validated in a separate cohort of chronic liver disease patients (n = 37). Etiologies for liver disease included non-alcoholic liver disease (58.0%), hepatitis C (26.0%), hepatitis B (10.0%), and alcohol (6.0%). Microbiome composition was distinct in liver patients with advanced fibrosis compared to those with minimal fibrosis and healthy controls (p = 0.003). In multivariate negative binomial modeling, 26 bacterial taxa were differentially abundant in patients with advanced fibrosis as compared to those with minimal/moderate fibrosis (q-value < 0.05). A random forests classifier based on these taxa had an AUROC of 0.90 to predict advanced fibrosis. Prevotella copri, which was enriched in patients with advanced fibrosis, was the most strongly predictive microbe in the classifier. The classifier had an AUROC of 0.82 for advanced fibrosis in the validation cohort and Prevotella copri remained the strongest predictive microbe for advanced fibrosis. There is a distinct microbial signature for patients with advanced fibrosis independent of liver disease etiology and other comorbidities. These results suggest that microbial profiles can be used as a non-invasive marker for advanced fibrosis and support the hypothesis that microbes and their metabolites contribute to hepatic fibrosis."
"ObjectiveEvaluate association between fluid balance and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).Study designRetrospective review of infants <30 weeks gestation admitted to Kentucky Children’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.ResultsInfants with acute kidney injury (AKI) had a 2.4-fold increased risk of IVH (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.46–3.87) and a 3.5-fold increased risk of severe IVH (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.98–6.04). Infants above birthweight on day 4 had a 1.9-fold increased risk of IVH (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05–3.27) and a 2.0-fold increased risk of severe IVH (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.03–3.74). When controlling for confounding factors, infants with AKI or above birthweight on day 4 had a 4.6-fold (aOR 4.60, 95% CI 1.80–11.78) and 3.0-fold (aOR 2.96, 95% CI 1.01–8.65) increased risk of severe IVH, respectively.ConclusionInfants with AKI during the first week of life had a higher association of severe IVH even after controlling for confounding factors."
"Digital technologies such as smartphones are transforming the way scientists conduct biomedical research. Several remotely conducted studies have recruited thousands of participants over a span of a few months allowing researchers to collect real-world data at scale and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research. Unfortunately, remote studies have been hampered by substantial participant attrition, calling into question the representativeness of the collected data including generalizability of outcomes. We report the findings regarding recruitment and retention from eight remote digital health studies conducted between 2014–2019 that provided individual-level study-app usage data from more than 100,000 participants completing nearly 3.5 million remote health evaluations over cumulative participation of 850,000 days. Median participant retention across eight studies varied widely from 2–26 days (median across all studies = 5.5 days). Survival analysis revealed several factors significantly associated with increase in participant retention time, including (i) referral by a clinician to the study (increase of 40 days in median retention time); (ii) compensation for participation (increase of 22 days, 1 study); (iii) having the clinical condition of interest in the study (increase of 7 days compared with controls); and (iv) older age (increase of 4 days). Additionally, four distinct patterns of daily app usage behavior were identified by unsupervised clustering, which were also associated with participant demographics. Most studies were not able to recruit a sample that was representative of the race/ethnicity or geographical diversity of the US. Together these findings can help inform recruitment and retention strategies to enable equitable participation of populations in future digital health research."
"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a major complication affecting patients of any age undergoing surgery. This syndrome impacts everyday life up to months after hospital discharge, and its pathophysiology still remains unclear. Translational research focusing on POCD is based on a wide variety of rodent models, such as the murine tibial fracture, whose severity can limit mouse locomotion and proper behavioral assessment. Besides, influence of skeletal muscle injury, a lesion encountered in a wide range of surgeries, has not been explored in POCD occurrence. We propose a physical model of muscle injury in CX3CR1GFP/+ mice (displaying green fluorescent microglial cells) to study POCD, with morphological, behavioral and molecular approaches. We highlighted: alteration of short- and long-term memory after muscle regeneration, wide microglial reactivity in the brain, including hippocampus area, 24 hours after muscle injury, and an alteration of central brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) balance, 28 days after muscle injury. Our results suggest for the first time that muscle injury can have early as well as late impacts on the brain. Our CX3CR1GFP/+ model can also facilitate microglial investigation, more specifically their pivotal role in neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity, in the pathophysiology of POCD."
"The natural history of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) includes rapid evolution from chemosensitivity to chemoresistance, although mechanisms underlying this evolution remain obscure due to the scarcity of post-relapse tissue samples. We generated circulating tumor cell (CTC)-derived xenografts from patients with SCLC to study intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) via single-cell RNA sequencing of chemosensitive and chemoresistant CTC-derived xenografts and patient CTCs. We found globally increased ITH, including heterogeneous expression of therapeutic targets and potential resistance pathways, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, between cellular subpopulations following treatment resistance. Similarly, serial profiling of patient CTCs directly from blood confirmed increased ITH post-relapse. These findings suggest that treatment resistance in SCLC is characterized by coexisting subpopulations of cells with heterogeneous gene expression leading to multiple, concurrent resistance mechanisms. These findings emphasize the need for clinical efforts to focus on rational combination therapies for treatment-naïve SCLC tumors to maximize initial responses and counteract the emergence of ITH and diverse resistance mechanisms."
"Monosomy 7 [−7] and/or partial loss of chromosome 7 [del(7q)] are associated with poor and intermediate prognosis, respectively, in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but somatic mutations may also play a key complementary role. We analyzed the impact on the outcomes of deep targeted mutational screening in 280 MDS patients with −7/del(7q) as isolated cytogenetic abnormality (86 with del(7q) and 194 with −7). Patients with del(7q) or −7 had similar demographic and disease-related characteristics. Somatic mutations were detected in 79% (93/117) of patients (82% in −7 and 73% in del(7q) group). Median number of mutations per patient was 2 (range 0–8). There was no difference in mutation frequency between the two groups. Patients harbouring ≥2 mutations had a worse outcome than patients with <2 or no mutations (leukaemic transformation at 24 months, 38% and 20%, respectively, p = 0.044). Untreated patients with del(7q) had better overall survival (OS) compared with −7 (median OS, 34 vs 17 months, p = 0.034). In multivariable analysis, blast count, TP53 mutations and number of mutations were independent predictors of OS, whereas the cytogenetic subgroups did not retain prognostic relevance. This study highlights the importance of mutational analysis in terms of prognosis in MDS patients with isolated −7 or del(7q)."
"Cochlear implantation has successfully restored the perception of hearing for nearly 200 thousand profoundly deaf adults and children. More recently, implant candidature has expanded to include those with considerable natural hearing which, when preserved, provides an improved hearing experience in noisy environments. But more than half of these patients lose this natural hearing soon after implantation. To reduce this burden, biosensing technologies are emerging that provide feedback on the quality of surgery. Here we report clinical findings on a new intra-operative measurement of electrical impedance (4-point impedance) which, when elevated, is associated with high rates of post-operative hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. In vivo and in vitro data presented suggest that elevated 4-point impedance is likely due to the presence of blood within the cochlea rather than its geometry. Four-point impedance is a new marker for the detection of cochlear injury causing bleeding, that may be incorporated into intraoperative monitoring protocols during CI surgery."
"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal plasma cell dyscrasia with a median overall survival of 5 to 10 years. MM progresses from the more common but often subclinical precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) to overt MM. There are large racial disparities in all stages of the disease. Compared with Whites, Blacks have an increased MGUS and MM risk and higher mortality rate, and have not experienced the same survival gains over time. The roots of this disparity are likely multifactorial in nature. Comparisons of Black and White MGUS and MM patients suggest that differences in risk factors, biology, and clinical characteristics exist by race or ancestry, which may explain some of the observed disparity in MM. However, poor accrual of Black MGUS and MM patients in clinical and epidemiological studies has limited our understanding of this disparity and hindered its elimination. Disparities in MM survival also exist but appear to stem from inferior treatment utilization and access rather than underlying pathogenesis. Innovative and multidisciplinary approaches are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of disparities that exist at each stage of the MM disease continuum and facilitate their elimination."
"Despite decades of clinical use, mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance are poorly understood. We treated primary murine T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) alone and in combination with the pan-PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 and observed a robust response to DEX that was modestly enhanced by GDC-0941. Continuous in vivo treatment invariably resulted in outgrowth of drug-resistant clones, ~30% of which showed markedly reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression. A similar proportion of relapsed human T-ALLs also exhibited low GR protein levels. De novo or preexisting mutations in the gene encoding GR (Nr3c1) occurred in relapsed clones derived from multiple independent parental leukemias. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing confirmed that loss of GR expression confers DEX resistance. Exposing drug-sensitive T-ALLs to DEX in vivo altered transcript levels of multiple genes, and this response was attenuated in relapsed T-ALLs. These data implicate reduced GR protein expression as a frequent cause of glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL."
"The oncogene epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is frequently expressed in glioblastomas (GBM) but its impact on therapy response is still under controversial debate. Here we wanted to test if EGFRvIII influences the sensitivity towards the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the survival of 336 GBM patients, demonstrating that under standard treatment, which includes TMZ, EGFRvIII expression is associated with prolonged survival, but only in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumors. Using isogenic GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII expression we could demonstrate that EGFRvIII increases TMZ sensitivity and results in enhanced numbers of DNA double-strand breaks and a pronounced S/G2-phase arrest after TMZ treatment. We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII. In summary, our results demonstrate that the oncoprotein EGFRvIII sensitizes a fraction of GBM to current standard of care treatment through the upregulation of DNA MMR."
"FOXM1, a known transcription factor, promotes cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. Here we show that Foxm1 is required for survival, quiescence and self-renewal of MLL-AF9 (MA9)-transformed leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in vivo. Mechanistically, Foxm1 upregulation activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways by directly binding to β-catenin and stabilizing β-catenin protein through inhibiting its degradation, thereby preserving LSC quiescence, and promoting LSC self-renewal in MLL-rearranged AML. More importantly, inhibition of FOXM1 markedly suppresses leukemogenic potential and induces apoptosis of primary LSCs from MLL-rearranged AML patients in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mice. Thus, our study shows a critical role and mechanisms of Foxm1 in MA9-LSCs, and indicates that FOXM1 is a potential therapeutic target for selectively eliminating LSCs in MLL-rearranged AML."
"Background/objectivesTo investigate the association between optical coherence tomography (OCT) markers of lesion activity and changes in visual acuity (VA) during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy of eyes diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD); and how VA and OCT markers are considered in physicians’ decision to retreat with anti-VEGFs.Subjects/methodsRetrospective, non-comparative, non-randomised cohort study involving electronic medical record data collected from 1190 patient eyes with nAMD diagnosis at two sites in the United Kingdom. Two sub-cohorts consisting of 321 and 301 eyes, respectively, were selected for analyses.ResultsIn 321 eyes, absence of IRF or SRF at ≥2 clinic visits resulted in a gain of five ETDRS letters from baseline, compared with two letters gained in eyes with <2 clinic visits with absence of IRF (p = 0.006) or SRF (p = 0.042). Anti-VEGF treatment was administered at 421 clinic visits, and 308 visits were without treatment. Comparing treatment visits with non-treatment visits, the maximum difference in frequency of OCT markers of lesion activity were for intraretinal fluid (IRF; 24% versus 5%) and subretinal fluid (SRF; 32% versus 5%). Pigment epithelial detachment (PED) was reported in 58% of treatment visits compared with 36% in non-treatment visits. VA loss was not a consistent trigger for retreatment as it was present in 63% of injection visits and in 49% of non-injection visits.ConclusionsRetreatment decision making is most strongly influenced by the presence of IRF and SRF and less by the presence of PED or VA loss."
"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most frequently used biomarker for the screening of prostate cancer. Understanding the structure of cancer-specific glycans can help us improve PSA assay. In the present study, we analysed the glycans of PSA obtained from culture medium containing cancer tissue-originated spheroids (CTOS) which have similar characteristics as that of the parent tumour to explore the new candidates for cancer-related glycoforms of PSA. The glycan profile of PSA from CTOS was determined by comparing with PSA from normal seminal plasma and cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1) using lectin chromatography and mass spectrometry. PSA from CTOS was mostly sialylated and the content of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin reactive glycan (LacdiNAc) was similar to that of PSA derived from seminal plasma and 22Rv1. Conversely, concanavalin A (Con A)-unbound PSA was definitely detected from the three cancer origins but was almost negligible in seminal PSA. Two novel types of PSA were elucidated in the Con A-unbound fraction: one is a high molecular weight PSA with highly branched N-glycans, and the other is a low molecular weight PSA without N-glycans. Furthermore, the existence of Lewis X antigen group on PSA was indicated. These PSAs will be candidates for new cancer-related markers."
"The presence of active neurogenic niches in adult humans is controversial. We focused attention to the human olfactory neuroepithelium, an extracranial site supplying input to the olfactory bulbs of the brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analyzing 28,726 cells, we identified neural stem cell and neural progenitor cell pools and neurons. Additionally, we detailed the expression of 140 olfactory receptors. These data from the olfactory neuroepithelium niche provide evidence that neuron production may continue for decades in humans."
"The genetic background of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) with chronic pruritus is complex. Filaggrin (FLG) is an essential gene in the epidermal barrier formation s. Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in FLG associated with skin barrier dysfunction constitute the most well-known genetic risk factor for AD. In this study, we focused on the frequency and effect of FLG loss-of-function variants in association with self-reported age-of-onset of AD. The dataset consisted of 386 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples. We observe a significant association between FLG LOF status and age-of-onset, with earlier age of onset of AD observed in the FLG LOF carrier group (p-value 0.0003, Wilcoxon two-sample test). We first tested this on the two most prevalent FLG variants. Interestingly, the effect is even stronger when considering all detected FLG LOF variants. Having two or more FLG LOF variants associates with the onset of AD at 2 years of age. In this study, we have shown enrichment of rare variants in the EDC region in cases compared with controls. Age-of-onset analysis shows not only the effect of the FLG and likely EDC variants in terms of the heightened risk of AD, but foremost enables to predict early-onset, lending further credence to the penetrance and causative effect of the identified variants. Understanding the genetic background and risk of early-onset is suggestive of skin barrier dysfunction etiology of AD with chronic pruritus"
"With a five-year survival rate of 9%, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest of all cancers. The rapid mortality makes PDAC difficult to research, and inspires a resolve to create reliable, tractable cellular models for preclinical cancer research. Organoids are increasingly used to model PDAC as they maintain the differentiation status, molecular and genomic signatures of the original tumour. In this paper, we present novel methodologies and experimental approaches to develop PDAC organoids from PDX tumours, and the simultaneous development of matched primary cell lines. Moreover, we also present a method of recapitulating primary cell line cultures to organoids (CLOs). We highlight the usefulness of CLOs as PDAC organoid models, as they maintain similar transcriptomic signatures as their matched patient-derived organoids and patient derived xenografts (PDX)s. These models provide a manageable, expandable in vitro resource for downstream applications such as high throughput screening, functional genomics, and tumour microenvironment studies."
"As the prevalence of obesity continues to grow worldwide, the health and financial burden of obesity-related comorbidities grows too. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is clearly associated with increased adiposity. Importantly, women are at higher risk of CVD when obese and insulin resistant, in particular at higher risk of developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and ischemic heart disease. Increased aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor activation, aberrant estrogenic signaling and elevated levels of androgens are among some of the proposed mechanisms explaining the heightened CVD risk. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, understanding nontraditional risk factors specific to women, like excess weight gain during pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and menopause are central to designing personalized interventions aimed to curb the epidemic of CVD. In the present review, we examine the available evidence supporting a differential cardiovascular impact of increased adiposity in women compared with men and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms behind these differences. We also discuss women-specific cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance."
"ObjectiveTo identify differences in feeding skill performance among preterm infants at term equivalent age compared with full-term infants.Study designNinety-two infants (44 preterm infants born ≤32 weeks gestation at term equivalent age and 48 full-term infants within 4 days of birth) had a standardized oral feeding assessment.ResultPreterm infants at term equivalent age had lower Neonatal Eating Outcome Assessment scores (67.8 ± 13.6 compared with 82.2 ± 8.1; p < 0.001) and were more likely to have poor arousal (p = 0.04), poor tongue positioning (p = 0.04), suck–swallow–breathe discoordination (p < 0.001), inadequate sucking bursts (p = 0.01), tonal abnormalities (p < 0.001), discoordination of the jaw and tongue during sucking (p < 0.001), lack of positive engagement with the feeder and/or discomfort (p < 0.001), signs of aspiration (p < 0.001), difficulty regulating breathing (p < 0.001), and have an inability to maintain an appropriate state (p < 0.001), and complete the feeding (<0.001).ConclusionA broad range of feeding-related difficulties appear to remain evident in preterm infants at term equivalent age."
"Cardiac surgeries may expose pulmonary arterial tissue to systemic conditions, potentially resulting in failure of that tissue. Our goal was to quantitatively assess pulmonary artery adaptation due to changes in mechanical environment. In 17 sheep, we placed a pulmonary autograft in aortic position, with or without macroporous mesh reinforcement. It was exposed to systemic conditions for 6 months. All sheep underwent 3 ECG-gated MRI’s. Explanted tissue was subjected to mechanical and histological analysis. Results showed progressive dilatation of the unreinforced autograft, while reinforced autografts stabilized after two months. Some unreinforced pulmonary autograft samples displayed more aorta-like mechanical behavior with increased collagen deposition. The mechanical behavior of reinforced autografts was dominated by the mesh. The decrease in media thickness and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells was more pronounced in reinforced than in unreinforced autografts. In conclusion, altering the mechanical environment of a pulmonary artery causes changes in its mechano-biological properties."
"CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are dichotomous lineages in adaptive immunity. While conventionally viewed as distinct fates that are fixed after thymic development, accumulating evidence indicates that these two populations can exhibit significant lineage plasticity, particularly upon TCR-mediated activation. We define a novel CD4−CD8αβ+ MHC II-recognizing population generated by lineage conversion from effector CD4+ T cells. CD4−CD8αβ+ effector T cells downregulated the expression of T helper cell-associated costimulatory molecules and increased the expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated cytotoxic molecules. This shift in functional potential corresponded with a CD8+-lineage skewed transcriptional profile. TCRβ repertoire sequencing and in vivo genetic lineage tracing in acutely infected wild-type mice demonstrated that CD4−CD8αβ+ effector T cells arise from fundamental lineage reprogramming of bona fide effector CD4+ T cells. Impairing autophagy via functional deletion of the initiating kinase Vps34 or the downstream enzyme Atg7 enhanced the generation of this cell population. These findings suggest that effector CD4+ T cells can exhibit a previously unreported degree of skewing towards the CD8+ T cell lineage, which may point towards a novel direction for HIV vaccine design."
"Ga-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT is a new tool for the assessment of prostate cancer. Standard imaging time is 60 minutes post injection of radiotracer. At 60 minutes, there is physiologic accumulation of radiotracer in the urinary bladder which may cause some lesions in its vicinity to be obscured. Our aim is to determine if early imaging at 3 minutes in addition to standard imaging at 60 minutes can improve the detection of PSMA-avid lesions. A retrospective review of 167 consecutive patients was conducted. Overall, 115 patients (68.9%) were ruled to have prostate cancer based on imaging as seen on early or standard PET/CT images. In 106/115 (64%), the lesions were detected on both early and standard imaging; in 8/115 (6.9%), the lesions were only detected on early imaging; in 1/115 (0.6%) the lesion was detected only on standard imaging. The addition of early imaging significantly improved the overall detection rate of PSMA-avid lesions (p = 0.039). The ratio of patients with lesions detected on early imaging but not on standard imaging in restaging group was 7/88 and was higher than that in staging group 1/79 (p = 0.043). We recommend early imaging in addition to the standard imaging in Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT, particularly in patients presenting for restaging of prostate cancer."
"PDCD4, the protein encoded by the tumor suppressor gene PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) has been implicated in the control of cellular transcription and translation by modulating the activity of specific transcription factors and suppressing the translation of mRNAs with structured 5′-UTRs. Most studies of human PDCD4 have employed tumor cell lines, possibly resulting in a biased picture of its role in normal cells. Here, we have studied the function of PDCD4 in a telomerase-immortalized human epithelial cell line. We show for the first time that PDCD4 is required for the G1/S-transition, demonstrating its crucial role in the cell cycle. Inhibition of p53-dependent activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 overrides the requirement for PDCD4 for the G1/S-transition, suggesting that PDCD4 counteracts basal p53 activity to prevent activation of the G1/S checkpoint by p53. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling data show that silencing of PDCD4 changes the expression levels and translation of many mRNAs, providing an unbiased view of the cellular processes that are affected by PDCD4 in an epithelial cell line. Our data identify PDCD4 as a key regulator of cell cycle- and DNA-related functions that are inhibited when it is silenced, suggesting that decreased expression of PDCD4 might contribute to tumor development by compromising genomic integrity."
"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) selectively promotes translation of mRNAs with atypically long and structured 5′-UTRs and has been implicated in drug resistance. Through genome-wide transcriptome and translatome analysis we revealed eIF4E overexpression could promote cellular activities mediated by ERα and FOXM1 signalling pathways. Whilst eIF4E overexpression could enhance the translation of both ERα and FOXM1, it also led to enhanced transcription of FOXM1. Polysome fractionation experiments confirmed eIF4E could modulate the translation of ERα and FOXM1 mRNA. The enhancement of FOXM1 transcription was contingent upon the presence of ERα, and it was the high levels of FOXM1 that conferred Tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, tamoxifen resistance was conferred by phosphorylation independent eIF4E overexpression. Immunohistochemistry on 134 estrogen receptor (ER+) primary breast cancer samples confirmed that high eIF4E expression was significantly associated with increased ERα and FOXM1, and significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism whereby phosphorylation independent eIF4E translational reprogramming in governing the protein synthesis of ERα and FOXM1 contributes to anti-estrogen insensitivity in ER+ breast cancer. In eIF4E overexpressing breast cancer, the increased ERα protein expression in turn enhances FOXM1 transcription, which together with its increased translation regulated by eIF4E, contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Coupled with eIF4E translational regulation, our study highlights an important mechanism conferring tamoxifen resistance via both ERα dependent and independent pathways."
"Cervical cancers are almost always induced by HPV infections, of which HPV16 and HPV18 are predominant. Cancers associated with these strains are induced through DNA repair factors and have a differential response to radiation therapy. Hence this study focuses on finding DNA repair gene expression differences in HPV16 and HPV18 positive cervical cancers after radiation therapy. A higher number of somatic mutations were observed in HPV16 positive cervical tumours for patients that were disease free when compared to those who recurred/progressed. Moreover, hierarchal clustering of RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was conducted to identify groups of DNA repair genes associated with a differential prognosis for cervical cancer following postoperative radiation therapy. TP53BP1, MCM9 (at higher than mean levels), POLR2F and SIRT6 (at lower than mean levels), were associated with an increase in patients experiencing cervical cancer recurrence/progression following postoperative radiation therapy when HPV18 positive, but not HPV16 positive. The expression patterns of these genes provide an explanation for the higher rate of postoperative radiation therapy resistance associated with HPV18 positive cervical cancer patients. Therefore, HPV18 positive cervical tumours may be more likely retain a greater non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination pathway activity, which could dampen the effect of postoperative radiation therapy. Moreover, greater susceptibility to postoperative radiation therapy could be caused by the reliance of cervical cancer cells upon the single-strand annealing and nucleotide excision pathways for repair of DNA damage."
"The close proximity of esophagus to the left atrial posterior wall predisposes esophagus to thermal injury during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate risk factors of esophageal injury (EI) caused by catheter ablation for AF. Patients who underwent first-time AF ablation from July 2013 to June 2018 were included. The esophagus was visualized by oral soluble contrast during ablation for all patients and a subset of patients were selected to undergo endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to estimate EI post ablation. Degree of EI was categorized as Kansas City classification: type 1: erythema; type 2: ulcers (2a: superficial ulcers; 2b: deep ulcers); type 3: perforation (3a: perforation without communication with the atria; 3b: atrioesophageal fistula [AEF]). Of 3,852 patients, 236 patients (61.5 ± 9.7 years; male, 69%) received EUS (EUS group) and 3616 (63.2 ± 10.9 years; male, 61.1%) without EUS (No-EUS group). In EUS group, EI occurred in 63 patients (type 1 EI in 35 and type 2 EI in 28), and no type 3 EI was observed during follow up. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, an overlap between the ablation lesion and esophagus was an independent predictor of EI (odds ratio, 21.2; 95% CI: 6.23–72.0; P < 0.001). In No-EUS group, esophagopericardial fistula (EPF; n = 3,0.08%) or AEF (n = 2,0.06%) was diagnosed 4–37 days after ablation. In 3 EPF patients, 2 completely recovered with conservative management and 1 died. Two AEF patients died. Ablation at the vicinity of the esophagus predicts risk of EI. EUS post ablation may prevent the progression of EI and should be considered in management of EI. It remains challenging to identify patients with high risk of EI."
"PurposeTo examine the clinical presentation, histopathological characteristics and surgical success of patients that underwent Kelly punch punctoplasty.MethodsA retrospective consecutive case series of all patients diagnosed with punctal stenosis and referred to Kelly punch punctoplasty and mini-monoka insertion between January 2017 and December 2017. The demographic, clinical and prognosis parameters were retrieved and analyzed. Moreover, a histopathological examination was performed on the tissue retrieved from the Kelly punch at the end of the procedure in order to evaluate the presence of muscle in the tissue, as well as chronic inflammation.ResultsThe series was composed of 44 eyes of 28 patients. All patients’ complaints prior to surgery were epiphora: 18 patients had bilateral epiphora, 5 presented with right-eye epiphora and 5 with left-eye epiphora. The average Munk degree of epiphora before surgery was 3 and at least 3 months after surgery 1.04 (matched pairs, p < 0.0001). Two patients underwent the second punctoplasty. In haematoxylin and eosin staining, the Riolan muscle was not visible in the mucosal layer in 40 specimens. In four specimens, the muscle was observed. A Masson's trichrome staining ensured that the Riolan muscle existed only in those four specimens.DiscussionKelly punch punctoplasty is a simple and minimally invasive procedure for punctal dilation with high functional success rate. Moreover, in histopathological specimens, in all but four of the cases there was no muscle indicated. Intact Riolan muscle enables the punctum to stay in the right circular shape and position, and the lacrimal pump to maintain its pressure gradient."
"Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe pediatric liver disease resulting in necroinflammatory obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tree. BA presents within the first few months of life as either an isolated finding or with additional syndromic features. The etiology of isolated BA is unknown, with evidence for infectious, environmental, and genetic risk factors described. However, to date, there are no definitive causal genes identified for isolated BA in humans, and the question of whether single gene defects play a major role remains open. We performed exome-sequencing in 101 North American patients of European descent with isolated BA (including 30 parent-child trios) and considered several experimental designs to identify potentially deleterious protein-altering variants that may be involved in the disease. In a case-only analysis, we did not identify genes with variants shared among more than two probands, and burden tests of rare variants using a case-case control design did not yield significant results. In the trio analysis of 30 simplex families (patient and parent trios), we identified 66 de novo variants in 66 genes including potentially deleterious variants in STIP1 and REV1. STIP1 is a co-chaperone for the heat-shock protein, HSP90, and has been shown to have diverse functions in yeast, flies and mammals, including stress-responses. REV1 is known to be a key player in DNA repair pathway and to interact with HSP90. In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that a simple genetic model is responsible for the majority of cases of isolated BA. Our finding of de novo variants in genes linked to evolutionarily conserved stress responses (STIP1 and REV1) suggests that exploration of how genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure may interact to cause BA is warranted."
"Current therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) aim to delay progression or replace damaged neurons by restoring the original neuronal structures. The poor regenerative capacity of neural tissue highlights the need for the development of cellular environments to model the pathogenesis of PD. In the current work, we have characterised the growth, survival and response to PD mimetics of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and U-87MG glioblastoma cell lines cultured on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and Jeffamine® doped polyacrylonitrile (PJ) nano-scaffolds. Differentiation induced by a range of agents was evaluated by immunoassays of neural protein biomarkers. PAN and PJ nanofibre scaffolds provided suitable three-dimensional (3D) environment to support the growth, differentiation and network formation of dopaminergic neuron- and astrocyte-like cell populations, respectively. The scaffolds selectively supported the survival and differentiation of both cell populations with prolonged neuronal survival when exposed to PD mimetics in the presence of astrocytes in a co-culture model. Such 3D nanoscaffold-based assays could aid our understanding of the molecular basis of PD mimetic-induced Parkinsonism and the discovery of neuroprotective agents."
"Study designSystematic review and meta-analysis.ObjectivesWe aimed to investigate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) against sham on muscle strength and motor functionality after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).SettingUniversity of São Paulo, Brazil.MethodsA preplanned protocol was registered (PROSPERO, CRD42016050444). Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Library and BVS databases were searched independently by two authors up to March 2018. Cochrane Collaboration’s Tool was used for the risk of bias assessments. Generic inverse variance and random-effects model were used to calculate pooled effect sizes (ES), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values in meta-analyses.ResultsSix randomized clinical trials met inclusion criteria (n = 78 iSCI individuals) and were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed a marginal significant pooled effect of active tDCS in improving motor functionality with a small ES (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI = −0.00 to 0.53, p = 0.05, I2 = 0%). On the other hand, the pooled effect of active tDCS on muscle strength did not reach statistical significance, in parallel with a small ES (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI = −0.21 to 0.92, p = 0.22, I2 = 0%) when compared with sham tDCS. No significant adverse events were reported.ConclusionsOverall, there was a significant effect of tDCS in improving motor functionality following iSCI. However, a small ES and the marginal p-value suggest that these results should be interpreted with caution. Further high-quality clinical trials are needed to support or refute the use of tDCS in daily clinical practice."
"Central memory T (TCM) cells patrol lymph nodes and perform conventional memory responses on restimulation: proliferation, migration and differentiation into diverse T cell subsets while also self-renewing. Resident memory T (TRM) cells are parked within single organs, share properties with terminal effectors and contribute to rapid host protection. We observed that reactivated TRM cells rejoined the circulating pool. Epigenetic analyses revealed that TRM cells align closely with conventional memory T cell populations, bearing little resemblance to recently activated effectors. Fully differentiated TRM cells isolated from small intestine epithelium exhibited the potential to differentiate into TCM cells, effector memory T cells and TRM cells on recall. Ex-TRM cells, former intestinal TRM cells that rejoined the circulating pool, heritably maintained a predilection for homing back to their tissue of origin on subsequent reactivation and a heightened capacity to redifferentiate into TRM cells. Thus, TRM cells can rejoin the circulation but are advantaged to re-form local TRM when called on."
"Comprehensive profiling of actionable mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is vital to guide targeted therapy, thereby improving the survival rate of patients. Despite the high incidence and mortality rate of NSCLC in Vietnam, the actionable mutation profiles of Vietnamese patients have not been thoroughly examined. Here, we employed massively parallel sequencing to identify alterations in major driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ALK and ROS1) in 350 Vietnamese NSCLC patients. We showed that the Vietnamese NSCLC patients exhibited mutations most frequently in EGFR (35.4%) and KRAS (22.6%), followed by ALK (6.6%), ROS1 (3.1%), BRAF (2.3%) and NRAS (0.6%). Interestingly, the cohort of Vietnamese patients with advanced adenocarcinoma had higher prevalence of EGFR mutations than the Caucasian MSK-IMPACT cohort. Compared to the East Asian cohort, it had lower EGFR but higher KRAS mutation prevalence. We found that KRAS mutations were more commonly detected in male patients while EGFR mutations was more frequently found in female. Moreover, younger patients (<61 years) had higher genetic rearrangements in ALK or ROS1. In conclusions, our study revealed mutation profiles of 6 driver genes in the largest cohort of NSCLC patients in Vietnam to date, highlighting significant differences in mutation prevalence to other cohorts."
"Treatment of community urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum β lactamase (ESBL)- producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) is more expensive than treating ESBL-negative opposites. Evaluation of the prevalence of ESBL-production among urinary E. coli isolates is crucial due to its great impact on the choice of proper antimicrobials. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to detect and characterize ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from outpatients with signs of UTIs in Upper Egypt. Urinary E. coli isolates were identified by 16S rRNA and their ESBL-production was confirmed by Modified Double Disc Synergy Test (MDDST) and ESBL- CHROMagar media. Isolates were then subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for new Clermont phylogrouping, ESBL genes detection and CTX-M typing. The study enrolled 583 patients with clinically diagnosed UTIs. Uropathogens were found in 400 urine samples (68.6%) out of which 134 E. coli isolates were identified. Among the examined uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), 80 (59.7%) were recognized as ESBL-producers. Greater than half of the ESBL-producers were multi-drug resistant (MDR) (62%). All of them were susceptible to meropenem. Most of the E. coli isolates were distributed in 4 phylogenetic groups: B2 = 42 (52.5%), F = 17 (21.25%) and Clade I or II = 10 (12.5%). The predominant gene types were TEM 60 (75%) and CTX-M gene 45 (56.25%). The CTX-M-1 group was the most prevalent (62.2%), including the CTX-M-15 enzyme, followed by the CTX-M-2 group, CTX-M-8 group and CTX-M-9 group. In conclusion, the results present alarming evidence of a serious spread of ESBL genes in Egypt, especially the epidemiological CTX-M 15, with the potential for the dissemination of MDR UPEC strains in the community."
"Current treatments for clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) are insufficient because two-thirds of patients with metastases progress within two years. Here we report the identification and characterization of a cancer stem cell (CSC) population in ccRCC. CSCs are quantitatively correlated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Transcriptional profiling and single cell sequencing reveal that these CSCs exhibit an activation of WNT and NOTCH signaling. A significant obstacle to the development of rational treatments has been the discrepancy between model systems and the in vivo situation of patients. To address this, we use CSCs to establish non-adherent sphere cultures, 3D tumor organoids, and xenografts. Treatment with WNT and NOTCH inhibitors blocks the proliferation and self-renewal of CSCs in sphere cultures and organoids, and impairs tumor growth in patient-derived xenografts in mice. These findings suggest that our approach is a promising route towards the development of personalized treatments for individual patients."
"Little data currently exist regarding whether and how different characteristics of a patient and session influence outcomes of genetic counseling (GC). We conducted an exploratory retrospective chart review of data from a specialist psychiatric GC clinic (where patients complete the Genetic Counseling Outcome Scale (GCOS) as part of routine care before and after GC). We used ANOVA and linear regression to analyze GCOS change scores in relation to twelve patient/session-related variables. Three hundred and seven charts were included in analyses. Overall, GCOS scores increased significantly after GC, with large effect size (p < 0.0005, d = 1.10), and significant increases in all GCOS subdomains except adaptation. Significant associations with GCOS change score were identified for three variables: mode of delivery of GC (in-person/telephone/telehealth, p = 0.048, η2 = 0.020), primary indication for the appointment (understanding recurrence risk versus other primary indications, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.037), and baseline GCOS score (p < 0.000, R = 0.353). Our data showing that those with low baseline GCOS scores benefit most from GC could be used to explore the possibility of triaging those referred for GC based on this variable, and/or to identify individuals to refer to GC."
"Study designCase series on four dogs.ObjectivesTo determine the alleviation of motor symptoms in spinal cord injury (SCI) by tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT).SettingDifferent Berlin veterinary clinics, Germany.MethodsWe report on the effect of intramuscular injections of low-dose TeNT into paretic hind limb muscles 2–157 weeks after SCI due to lumbar disc herniation in a clinical case series on four dogs. All dogs underwent unsuccessful or incomplete surgical decompression prior to TeNT treatment. TeNT was injected on a compassionate basis. Stance, gait ability and the diameter of the rectus femoris muscle were assessed as parameters.ResultsAll four dogs improved their stance and three of these dogs improved in gait at 4 and 6 weeks after TeNT injections without evidence of side effects or spreading of TeNT effects. At the same time, the size of the rectus femoris muscle diameter increased considerably as compared with baseline (baseline: 100%; 4 weeks: 148.7% ± 10.9%; 6 weeks: 137.1% ± 7.9%).ConclusionsFacilitation of α-motor neurons by TeNT injections into paretic hind limb muscles of four dogs improved standing and/or gait abilities and partly reversed muscle atrophy after SCI. The absence of generalized or painful muscle spasms supports the safety of low-dose TeNT. Therefore, TeNT might evolve as a promising therapeutic option for muscle paresis of central origin, e.g. in individuals with SCI, stroke or multiple sclerosis."
"Resistance to cancer therapy is a challenge because of innate tumor heterogeneity and constant tumor evolution. Since the pathway of resistance cannot be predicted, combination therapies may address this progression. We discovered that in addition to IGF1 and IGF2, IGFBP-3 binds bFGF, HGF, neuregulin, and PDGF AB with nanomolar affinity. Because growth factors drive resistance, simultaneous inhibition of multiple growth factor pathways may improve the efficacy of precision therapy. Growth factor sequestration by IGFBP-3-Fc enhances the activity of EGFR inhibitors by decreasing cell survival and inhibiting bFGF, HGF, and IGF1 growth factor rescue and also potentiates the activity of other cancer drugs. Inhibition of tumor growth in vivo with adjuvant IGFBP-3-Fc with erlotinib versus erlotinib after treatment cessation supports that the combination reduces cell survival. Inhibition of multiple growth factor pathways may postpone resistance and extend progression-free survival in many cancer indications."
"Red yeast rice (RYR) extract is widely used for improving cardiovascular outcomes and lipid profiles. However, RYR efficacy on cardiovascular outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) patients remains unclear. This meta-analysis assessed efficacy of RYR extract in MI patients with borderline hypercholesterolemia. PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched from inception through May 2019 for relevant publications. Seven studies with 10,699 MI patients diagnosed with borderline hypercholesterolemia were included. Follow-up periods ranged from 4 weeks – 4.5 years and the studies were overall of high quality with low risk of bias. RYR extract (1,200 mg/day) reduced nonfatal MI (risk ratio (RR) = 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52), revascularization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71), and sudden death (RR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94). RYR extract also lowered LDL (weighted mean difference (WMD) = −20.70 mg/dL, 95% CI −24.51 to −16.90), TC (WMD = −26.61 mg/dL, 95% CI −31.65 to −21.58), TG (WMD = − 24.69 mg/dL, 95% CI −34.36 to −15.03), and increased HDL levels (WMD = 2.71 mg/dL, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.17). This meta-analysis indicated that RYR extract in MI patients with borderline hypercholesterolemia is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and lipid profiles."
"BackgroundMortality and ECMO rates for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) remain ~30%. In 2016, we changed our CDH guidelines to minimize stimulation while relying on preductal oxygen saturation, lower mean airway pressures, stricter criteria for nitric oxide (iNO), and inotrope use. We compared rates of ECMO, survival, and survival without ECMO between the two epochs.Design/MethodsRetrospective review of left-sided CDH neonates at the University of Utah/Primary Children’s Hospital NICUs during pre (2003–2015, n = 163) and post (2016–2019, n = 53) epochs was conducted. Regression analysis controlled for defect size and intra-thoracic liver.ResultsFollowing guideline changes, we identified a decrease in ECMO (37 to 13%; p = 0.001) and an increase in survival without ECMO (53 to 79%, p = 0.0001). Overall survival increased from 74 to 89% (p = 0.035).Conclusion(s)CDH management guideline changes focusing on minimizing stimulation, using preductal saturation and less aggressive ventilator/inotrope support were associated with decreased ECMO use and improved survival."
"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders, with few effective neuropharmacological treatments, making treatments development critical. While noninvasive neuromodulation can successfully treat depression, few treatment targets have been identified specifically for anxiety disorders. Previously, we showed that shock threat increases excitability and connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Here we tested the hypothesis that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting this region would reduce induced anxiety. Subjects were exposed to neutral, predictable, and unpredictable shock threat, while receiving double-blinded, 1 Hz active or sham IPS rTMS. We used global brain connectivity and electric-field modelling to define the single-subject targets. We assessed subjective anxiety with online ratings and physiological arousal with the startle reflex. Startle stimuli (103 dB white noise) probed fear and anxiety during the predictable (fear-potentiated startle, FPS) and unpredictable (anxiety-potentiated startle, APS) conditions. Active rTMS reduced both FPS and APS relative to both the sham and no stimulation conditions. However, the online anxiety ratings showed no difference between the stimulation conditions. These results were not dependent on the laterality of the stimulation, or the subjects’ perception of the stimulation (i.e. active vs. sham). Results suggest that reducing IPS excitability during shock threat is sufficient to reduce physiological arousal related to both fear and anxiety, and are consistent with our previous research showing hyperexcitability in this region during threat. By extension, these results suggest that 1 Hz parietal stimulation may be an effective treatment for clinical anxiety, warranting future work in anxiety patients."
"TP53 mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor prognosis. Since no targeted therapy is available to restore p53 function, it is of great interest to test whether other pathways activated by TP53 mutations can be therapeutically targeted. Here, we showed HIF-1α target genes are enriched in TP53-mutated versus TP53-wild-type AML. To determine the role of this activation, we tested efficacy of HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin in TP53-mutated AML samples in vitro and in vivo. Echinomycin was broadly effective against a panel of primary AML blast cells, with low nanomolar IC50s and, based on colony-forming unit assay, was tenfold more effective in eliminating AML stem cells. Echinomycin selectively eliminated CD34+CD38− AML cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of echinomycin, we established a xenograft model of TP53-mutated AML. Echinomycin was broadly effective against xenografts from multiple AML samples in vivo, and more effective than cytarabine + daunorubicin chemotherapy. Importantly, while cytarabine + daunorubicin enriched for AML stem cells, echinomycin nearly eliminated this population. Using TP53-mutated AML cell line THP1 and patient-derived AML cells, we tested a new echinomycin formulation with longer half-life and significantly improved therapeutic effect. Our data suggest a novel approach to treat AML with TP53 mutations."
"Homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway deficiency (HRD) is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) as well as in the sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we obtained data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on HGSOC and identified scores for the loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions, and calculated the HRD score. We then investigated the relationships among the score, genetic/epigenetic alterations in HRR-related genes, and the clinical data. We found that BRCA1/2 mutations were enriched in the group with HRD scores ≥63. Compared with the groups with scores ≤62, this group had a good prognosis; we thus considered HRD scores ≥63 to be the best cutoff point for identifying HRD cases in HGSOC. Classification of HGSOC cases by the HRD status revealed a better prognosis for HRD cases caused by genetic alterations (genetic HRD) than those caused by epigenetic changes and those caused by undetermined reasons (p = 0.0002). Among cases without macroscopic residual tumors after primary debulking surgery, 11 of 12 genetic HRD cases survived after the median observation period of 6.6 years, showing remarkably high survival rates (p = 0.0059). In conclusion, HGSOC can be classified into subtypes with different prognoses according to HRD status. This classification could be useful for personalized HGSOC treatment."
"Due to their high specific surface area, graphene oxide and graphene oxide-base nanoparticles have great potential both in dual-drug delivery and combination chemotherapy. Herein, we developed cisplatin (Pt) and doxorubicin (DOX) dual-drug-loaded PEGylated nano-graphene oxide (pGO) to facilitate combined chemotherapy in one system. In this study, nano-sized pGO-Pt/DOX ranged around 161.50 nm was fabricated and characterized using zeta-potential, AFM, TEM, Raman, UV-Vis, and FTIR analyses. The drug delivery efficacy of Pt was enhanced through the introduction of pGO, and the final weight ratio of DOX: Pt: pGO was optimized to 0.376: 0.376: 1. In vitro studies revealed that pGO-Pt/DOX nanoparticles could be effectively delivered into tumor cells, in which they induced prominent cell apoptosis and necrosis and exhibited higher growth inhibition than the single drug delivery system or free drugs. The pGO-Pt/DOX induced the most prominent cancer cell apoptosis and necrosis rate with 18.6%, which was observed almost 2 times higher than that of pGO-Pt or pGO-DOX groups. in the apoptosis and necrotic quadrants In vivo data confirmed that the pGO-Pt/DOX dual-drug delivery system attenuated the toxicity of Pt and DOX to normal organs compared to free drugs. The tumor inhibition data, histopathology observations, and immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the dual-drug delivery system presented a better anticancer effect than free drugs. These results clearly indicated that the pGO-Pt/DOX dual-drug delivery system provided the means for combination drug delivery in cancer treatment."
"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can transduce hepatocytes efficiently in vivo in various animal species, including humans. Few reports, however, have examined the utility of pigs in gene therapy. Pigs are potentially useful in preclinical studies because of their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. Here, we evaluated the utility of microminipigs for liver-targeted gene therapy. These pigs were intravenously inoculated with an AAV8 vector encoding the luciferase gene, and gene expression was assessed by an in vivo imaging system. Robust transgene expression was observed almost exclusively in the liver, even though the pig showed a low-titer of neutralizing antibody (NAb) against the AAV8 capsid. We assessed the action of NAbs against AAV, which interfere with AAV vector-mediated gene transfer by intravascular delivery. When a standard dose of vector was administered intravenously, transgene expression was observed in both NAb-negative and low-titer (14×)-positive subjects, whereas gene expression was not observed in animals with higher titers (56×). These results are compatible with our previous observations using nonhuman primates, indicating that pigs are useful in gene therapy experiments, and that the role of low-titer NAb in intravenous administration of the AAV vector shows similarities across species."
"Parkinson’s disease is a synucleinopathy that is characterized by motor dysfunction, death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates. Evidence suggests that α-Syn aggregation can originate in peripheral tissues and progress to the brain via autonomic fibers. We tested this by inoculating the duodenal wall of mice with α-Syn preformed fibrils. Following inoculation, we observed gastrointestinal deficits and physiological changes to the enteric nervous system. Using the AAV-PHP.S capsid to target the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase for peripheral gene transfer, we found that α-Syn pathology is reduced due to the increased expression of this protein. Lastly, inoculation of α-Syn fibrils in aged mice, but not younger mice, resulted in progression of α-Syn histopathology to the midbrain and subsequent motor defects. Our results characterize peripheral synucleinopathy in prodromal Parkinson’s disease and explore cellular mechanisms for the gut-to-brain progression of α-Syn pathology."
"Genomic alterations shape cell phenotypes and the structure of tumor ecosystems in poorly defined ways. To investigate these relationships, we used imaging mass cytometry to quantify the expression of 37 proteins with subcellular spatial resolution in 483 tumors from the METABRIC cohort. Single-cell analysis revealed cell phenotypes spanning epithelial, stromal and immune types. Distinct combinations of cell phenotypes and cell–cell interactions were associated with genomic subtypes of breast cancer. Epithelial luminal cell phenotypes separated into those predominantly impacted by mutations and those affected by copy number aberrations. Several features of tumor ecosystems, including cellular neighborhoods, were linked to prognosis, illustrating their clinical relevance. In summary, systematic analysis of single-cell phenotypic and spatial correlates of genomic alterations in cancer revealed how genomes shape both the composition and architecture of breast tumor ecosystems and will enable greater understanding of the phenotypic impact of genomic alterations."
"A key goal of cancer systems biology is to use big data to elucidate the molecular networks by which cancer develops. However, to date there has been no systematic evaluation of how far these efforts have progressed. In this Analysis, we survey six major systems biology approaches for mapping and modelling cancer pathways with attention to how well their resulting network maps cover and enhance current knowledge. Our sample of 2,070 systems biology maps captures all literature-curated cancer pathways with significant enrichment, although the strong tendency is for these maps to recover isolated mechanisms rather than entire integrated processes. Systems biology maps also identify previously underappreciated functions, such as a potential role for human papillomavirus-induced chromosomal alterations in ovarian tumorigenesis, and they add new genes to known cancer pathways, such as those related to metabolism, Hippo signalling and immunity. Notably, we find that many cancer networks have been provided only in journal figures and not for programmatic access, underscoring the need to deposit network maps in community databases to ensure they can be readily accessed. Finally, few of these findings have yet been clinically translated, leaving ample opportunity for future translational studies. Periodic surveys of cancer pathway maps, such as the one reported here, are critical to assess progress in the field and identify underserved areas of methodology and cancer biology."
"Capecitabine is selectively converted from 5′-DFUR to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in tumours by thymidine phosphorylase (TP). We investigated the addition of 5-nitrouracil (5-NU), a TP inhibitor, into blood samples for precise measurements of plasma 5-FU concentrations. The plasma concentration of 5-FU was measured after capecitabine administration. Two samples were obtained at 1 or 2 h after capecitabine administration and 5-NU was added to one of each pair. Samples were stored at room temperature or 4 °C and 5-FU concentrations were measured immediately or 1.5 or 3 h later. The mean plasma 5-FU concentration was significantly higher at room temperature than at 4 °C (p < 0.001). The 5-FU concentration was significantly increased in the absence of 5-NU than in the presence of 5-NU (p < 0.001). The 5-FU change in concentration was greater in the absence of 5-NU, and reached 190% of the maximum compared with baseline. A significant interaction was found between temperature and 5-NU conditions (p < 0.001). Differences between the presence or absence of 5-NU were greater at room temperature than under refrigerated conditions. 5-FU plasma concentrations after capecitabine administration varied with time, temperature, and the presence or absence of 5-NU. This indicates that plasma concentrations of 5-FU change dependent on storage conditions after blood collection."
"Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis belong to the Mitis group streptococci, which mostly are commensals in the human oral cavity. Though they are oral commensals, they can escape their niche and cause infective endocarditis, a severe infection with high mortality. Several virulence factors important for the development of infective endocarditis have been described in these two species. However, the background for how the commensal bacteria, in some cases, become pathogenic is still not known. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the pathogenic potential, we performed a comparative analysis of 38 blood culture strains, S. sanguinis (n = 20) and S. gordonii (n = 18) from patients with verified infective endocarditis, along with 21 publicly available oral isolates from healthy individuals, S. sanguinis (n = 12) and S. gordonii (n = 9). Using whole genome sequencing data of the 59 streptococci genomes, functional profiles were constructed, using protein domain predictions based on the translated genes. These functional profiles were used for clustering, phylogenetics and machine learning. A clear separation could be made between the two species. No clear differences between oral isolates and clinical infective endocarditis isolates were found in any of the 675 translated core-genes. Additionally, random forest-based machine learning and clustering of the pan-genome data as well as amino acid variations in the core-genome could not separate the clinical and oral isolates. A total of 151 different virulence genes was identified in the 59 genomes. Among these homologs of genes important for adhesion and evasion of the immune system were found in all of the strains. Based on the functional profiles and virulence gene content of the genomes, we believe that all analysed strains had the ability to become pathogenic."
"TET2 and EZH2 play important roles in the epigenetic regulation in many cancers. However, their specific roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, the expression, methylation or mutation of EZH2 and TET2 was determined and further correlated with the levels of the chromosome instability (CIN) genes MAD2 and CDC20. We down-regulated EZH2 and TET2 in AML cell lines and assessed the effect on CIN using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Our results showed that TET2, EZH2, MAD2 and CDC20 were aberrantly expressed in AML patients. The expression level of MAD2 or CDC20 was positively correlated with that of TET2 or EZH2. Hypermethylation of the TET2 gene down-regulated its transcription. Down-regulation of EZH2 or TET2 expression inhibited apoptosis, affected MAD2 and CDC20 expression, and promoted CIN in AML cells. Decitabine treatment restored TET2 methylation and EZH2 transcription and ameliorated CIN in AML. Therefore, TET2 and EZH2 play a tumor-inhibiting role in AML that affects CIN via MAD2 and CDC20."
"Repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation of expanded CGG repeats (CGG RAN) from the FMR1 5′-leader produces toxic proteins that contribute to neurodegeneration in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Here we describe how unexpanded CGG repeats and their translation play conserved roles in regulating fragile X protein (FMRP) synthesis. In neurons, CGG RAN acts as an inhibitory upstream open reading frame to suppress basal FMRP production. Activation of mGluR5 receptors enhances FMRP synthesis. This enhancement requires both the CGG repeat and CGG RAN initiation sites. Using non-cleaving antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), we selectively blocked CGG RAN. This ASO blockade enhanced endogenous FMRP expression in human neurons. In human and rodent neurons, CGG RAN-blocking ASOs suppressed repeat toxicity and prolonged survival. These findings delineate a native function for CGG repeats and RAN translation in regulating basal and activity-dependent FMRP synthesis, and they demonstrate the therapeutic potential of modulating CGG RAN translation in fragile X-associated disorders."
"The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in prostate cancer (PC) development and progression. Inappropriate activation of the stroma potentiates the growth and transformation of epithelial tumor cells. Here, we show that upregulation of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines, in stromal cells elevates production of reactive oxygen species, triggers an inflammatory response including activation of IL-6, and promotes tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MAOA enhances IL-6 transcription through direct Twist1 binding to a conserved E-box element at the IL-6 promoter. MAOA in stromal fibroblasts provides tumor cell growth advantages through paracrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling. Tissue microarray analysis revealed co-expression correlations between individual pairs of proteins of the stromal MAOA-induced Twist1/IL-6/STAT3 pathway in clinical specimens. Downstream of stromal MAOA, STAT3 also promotes cell stemness and transcriptionally activates expression of cancer stem cell marker CD44 in PC cells. MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively suppressed prostate tumor growth in mice in a stroma-specific targeted manner. Collectively, these findings characterize the contribution of MAOA to stromal activation in PC pathogenesis and provide a rationale for targeting MAOA in stromal cells to treat PC."
"In this single-arm non-comparative trial, 13 patients in an Australian hospital with severe Staphylococcus aureus infections were intravenously administered a good manufacturing practice-quality preparation of three Myoviridae bacteriophages (AB-SA01) as adjunctive therapy. AB-SA01 was intravenously administered twice daily for 14 d and the clinical, haematological and blood biochemical parameters of the recipients were monitored for 90 d. The primary outcome was the assessment of safety and tolerability (that is, pain and redness at the infusion site and systemic adverse reactions, such as fever, tachycardia, hypotension, diarrhoea or abdominal pain and the development of renal or hepatic dysfunction). No adverse reactions were reported, and our data indicate that AB-SA01 administered in this way is safe in severe S. aureus infections, including infective endocarditis and septic shock. Future controlled trials will be needed to determine the efficacy of AB-SA01 but no phage resistance evolved in vivo and the measurements of bacterial and phage kinetics in blood samples suggest that 12 h dosing of 109 plaque-forming units may be a rational basis for further studies. Trial Registration: Westmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee HREC/17/WMEAD/275; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03395769; Clinical Trials Notification (Australian Therapeutic Goods Association): CT-2018-CTN-02372-1."
"Ferroptosis is widely involved in degenerative diseases in various tissues including kidney, liver and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple primary and therapy-resistant cancers. Accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides in cellular membranes is the hallmark and rate-limiting step of ferroptosis; however, the enzymes contributing to lipid peroxidation remain poorly characterized. Using genome-wide, CRISPR–Cas9-mediated suppressor screens, we identify cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) as necessary for ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells exhibiting inherent and induced susceptibility to ferroptosis. By genetic depletion of POR in cancer cells, we reveal that POR contributes to ferroptosis across a wide range of lineages and cell states, and in response to distinct mechanisms of ferroptosis induction. Using systematic lipidomic profiling, we further map POR’s activity to the lipid peroxidation step in ferroptosis. Hence, our work suggests that POR is a key mediator of ferroptosis and potential druggable target for developing antiferroptosis therapeutics."
"Type I interferons, particularly interferon-alpha (IFN-α), play a vital role in the host's anti-viral defenses by interfering with viral replication. However, the virus rapidly evolves to exploit the IFN-α response for its replication, spread, and pathogenic function. In this study, we attempted to determine IFN-α susceptibility and productivity of infectious transmitted/founder (TF) (n = 8) and non-transmitted (NT) viruses (n = 8) derived from HIV-1 infected infants. Independent experiments were carried out to determine IFN-α resistance, replication fitness, and viral productivity in CD4+ T cells over a short period. In vitro studies showed that TF viruses were resistant to IFN-α during the very near moment of transmission, but in the subsequent time points, they became susceptible to IFN-α. We did not observe much difference in replicative fitness of the TF viruses in cultures treated with and without IFN-α, but the difference was significant in the case of NT viruses obtained from the same individual. Despite increased susceptibility to IFN-α, NT viruses produced more viral particles than TF viruses. Similar results were also obtained in cultures treated with maraviroc (MVC). The study identified unique characteristics of TF viruses thus prompting further investigation into virus-host interaction occurring during the early stages of HIV infection."
"Recent studies associated certain type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects, mainly driven by the central role of mitochondria in cellular metabolism. Considering the importance of the control region (CR) on the regulation of the mtDNA gene expression, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of mtDNA CR mutations in two CVDs: stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). MtDNA CR mutations (both fixed and in heteroplasmy) were analysed in two demographically-matched case-control samples, using 154 stroke cases, 211 MI cases and their corresponding control individuals. Significant differences were found, reporting mutations m.16145 G > A and m.16311 T > C as potential genetic risk factors for stroke (conditional logistic regression: p = 0.038 and p = 0.018, respectively), whereas the m.72 T > C, m.73 A > G and m.16356 T > C mutations could act as possible beneficial genetic factors for MI (conditional logistic regression: p = 0.001, p = 0.009 and p = 0.016, respectively). Furthermore, our findings also showed a high percentage of point heteroplasmy in MI controls (logistic regression: p = 0.046; OR = 0.209, 95% CI [0.045–0.972]). These results demonstrate the possible role of mtDNA mutations in the CR on the pathogenesis of stroke and MI, and show the importance of including this regulatory region in genetic association studies."
"Normative brain atlases are a standard tool for neuroscience research and are, for example, used for spatial normalization of image datasets prior to voxel-based analyses of brain morphology and function. Although many different atlases are publicly available, they are usually biased with respect to an imaging modality and the age distribution. Both effects are well known to negatively impact the accuracy and reliability of the spatial normalization process using non-linear image registration methods. An important and very active neuroscience area that lacks appropriate atlases is lesion-related research in elderly populations (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis) for which FLAIR MRI and non-contrast CT are often the clinical imaging modalities of choice. To overcome the lack of atlases for these tasks and modalities, this paper presents high-resolution, age-specific FLAIR and non-contrast CT atlases of the elderly generated using clinical images."
"trans-Fatty acids (TFAs) are unsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds in trans configuration. Epidemiological evidence has linked TFA consumption with various disorders, including cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show a novel toxic mechanism of TFAs triggered by DNA damage. We found that elaidic acid (EA) and linoelaidic acid, major TFAs produced during industrial food manufacturing (so-called as industrial TFAs), but not their corresponding cis isomers, facilitated apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Consistently, EA enhanced UV-induced embryonic lethality in C. elegans worms. The pro-apoptotic action of EA was blocked by knocking down Sab, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein localizing at mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates mutual amplification of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. EA enhanced doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and JNK activation, both of which were suppressed by Sab knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of either mitochondrial ROS generation, JNK, or Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) as a Sab-associated protein. These results demonstrate that in response to DNA damage, TFAs drive the mitochondrial JNK-Sab-ROS positive feedback loop and ultimately apoptosis, which may provide insight into the common pathogenetic mechanisms of diverse TFA-related disorders."
"Melanoma is the leading cause of death among cutaneous neoplasms. Best outcome relies on early detection and accurate pathologic diagnosis. For the great majority of melanocytic tumors, histopathologic examination can reliably distinguish nevi from melanomas. However, there is a subset of melanocytic tumors that cannot be definitively classified as benign or malignant using histopathological criteria alone. These tumors are usually diagnosed using terms that imply various degrees of uncertainty in regards to their malignant potential and create the possibility for over or undertreatment. For such tumors, additional ancillary tests would be beneficial in adjudicating a more definitive diagnosis. In recent years, DNA-based molecular ancillary tests, specifically comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, have been developed to help guide the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic proliferations. This study will present an updated overview of these two major ancillary tests, which are currently being used in clinical practice to assist in the diagnosis of challenging melanocytic neoplasms."
"Progeroid syndromes are a group of rare genetic disorders, which mimic natural aging. Unraveling the molecular defects in such conditions could impact our understanding of age-related syndromes such as Alzheimer’s or cardiovascular diseases. Here we report a de novo heterozygous missense variant in the intermediate filament vimentin (c.1160 T > C; p.(Leu387Pro)) causing a multisystem disorder associated with frontonasal dysostosis and premature aging in a 39-year-old individual. Human vimentin p.(Leu387Pro) expression in zebrafish perturbed body fat distribution, and craniofacial and peripheral nervous system development. In addition, studies in patient-derived and transfected cells revealed that the variant affects vimentin turnover and its ability to form filaments in the absence of wild-type vimentin. Vimentin p.(Leu387Pro) expression diminished the amount of peripilin and reduced lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocytes, recapitulating key patient’s features in vivo and in vitro. Our data highlight the function of vimentin during development and suggest its contribution to natural aging."
"BackgroundRetinal microaneurysms (MAs) are among the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and are typically detected by fluorescein angiography (FA). Confocal MultiColor is a noninvasive-imaging technique able to analyze different retinal features by capturing three simultaneous reflectance images. The main aim of the present study was to characterize morphological features of MAs by means of MultiColor images and to compare these with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and FA findings.MethodsA cross-sectional, observational study setting was chosen. Multimodal imaging included MultiColor, SD-OCT and FA images. We performed a qualitative analysis in order to assess the relationship between MultiColor and its green- and red-reflectance components, SD-OCT (hyperreflective, hyporeflective and mixed reflectivity) and FA findings. MAs detected on our MultiColor images were then categorized in accordance with a previously published histological classification.ResultsIn our study FA images were used to detect 153 MAs in 30 eyes displaying DR. MultiColor was able to distinguish 122 MAs (80%). We identified green (16%), red (19%), and mixed (65%) MAs, corresponding to different reflectivity features detected by SD-OCT. MAs not visualized on MultiColor images corresponded to tiny hyperreflective lesions on SD-OCT. We compared our imaging findings with a histological MA classification reported in the literature. Our findings showed a strict relationship between MA subtypes and SD-OCT, suggesting that the composition of MAs (cells + endothelium + fibrosis) may influence the signal detected in MultiColor images.ConclusionsMultiColor appears to be a useful technique for investigating MA features in patients with DR."
"Adjuvants are central to the efficacy of subunit vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation. These data provide insights into mechanisms of action of alum and introduce a readily translatable approach to significantly improve humoral immunity to subunit vaccines using a clinical adjuvant."
"Study designCross-sectional survey.ObjectivesMost studies on neurological recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) assess treatment effects using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS grade) or motor points recovery. To what extent neurological recovery is considered clinically meaningful is unknown. This study investigated the perceived clinical benefit of various degrees of neurological recovery one year after C5 AIS-A tSCI.SettingThe Netherlands.MethodsBy means of a web-based survey SCI patients and physicians evaluated the benefit of various scenarios of neurological recovery on a scale from 0 to 100% (0% no benefit to 100% major benefit). Recovery to AIS-C and D, was split into C/C+ and D/D+, which was defined by the lower and upper limit of recovery for each grade.ResultsA total of 79 patients and 77 physicians participated in the survey. Each AIS grade improvement from AIS-A was considered significant benefit (all p < 0.05), ranging from 47.8% (SD 26.1) for AIS-B to 86.8% (SD 24.3) for AIS-D+. Motor level lowering was also considered significant benefit (p < 0.05), ranging from 66.1% (SD 22.3) for C6 to 81.7% (SD 26.0) for C8.ConclusionsMeaningful recovery can be achieved without improving in AIS grade, since the recovery of functional motor levels appears to be as important as improving in AIS grade by both patients and physicians. Moreover, minor neurological improvements within AIS-C and D are also considered clinically meaningful. Future studies should incorporate more detailed neurological outcomes to prevent potential underestimation of neurological recovery by only using the AIS grade."
"We performed an independent comparison of neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibody (ab) levels seven months after initiation of three-dose, six-month vaccination schedules with the bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in adolescent Finnish and Indian females, respectively. We used a semi-automated Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay and observed significantly higher HPV16/18 peak ab-levels in bivalent as compared to quadrivalent vaccine recipients. Bivalent vaccine induced cross-neutralizing HPV31/33/45/52/58 antibodies significantly more frequently and to higher levels than the quadrivalent vaccine. The correlation of bivalent vaccine-induced HPV45 ab-levels with HPV16/18 ab-levels was stronger than that of corresponding quadrivalent vaccine-induced ab-levels, suggesting a qualitatively different cross-reactive response. Our findings on the comparison of the immunogenicity of two HPV vaccine tested in two different populations indicate that further head-to-head studies are warranted."
"The development of personalized therapies represents an urgent need owing to the high rate of cancer recurrence and systemic toxicity of conventional drugs. So far, targeted toxins have shown promising results as potential therapeutic compounds. Specifically, toxins conjugated to antibodies or fused to growth factors/enzymes have been largely demonstrated to selectively address and kill cancer cells. We investigated the anti-tumor potential of a chimeric recombinant fusion protein formed by the Ribosome Inactivating Protein saporin (SAP) and the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), whose receptor has been shown to be over-expressed on the surface of aggressive tumors. ATF-SAP was recombinantly produced by the P. pastoris yeast and its activity was assessed on a panel of bladder and breast cancer cell lines. ATF-SAP resulted to be highly active in vitro, as nano-molar concentrations were sufficient to impair viability on tumor cell lines. In contrast to untargeted toxins, the chimeric fusion protein displayed a significantly improved toxic effect in uPAR-expressing cells, demonstrating that the selective activity was due to the presence of the targeting moiety. Fibroblasts were not sensitive to ATF-SAP despite uPAR expression, indicating that cell-specific receptor-mediated internalization pathway(s) might be considered. The in vivo anti-tumor effect of the chimera was shown in a bladder cancer xenograft model. Current findings indicate ATF-SAP as a suitable anti-tumoral therapeutic option to cope with cancer aggressiveness, as a single treatment or in combination with traditional therapeutic approaches, to appropriately address the intra- and inter- tumor heterogeneity."
"The gene encoding adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3 (ADGRL3, also referred to as latrophilin 3 or LPHN3) has been associated with ADHD susceptibility in independent ADHD samples. We conducted a systematic review and a comprehensive meta-analysis to summarize the associations between the most studied ADGRL3 polymorphisms (rs6551665, rs1947274, rs1947275, and rs2345039) and both childhood and adulthood ADHD. Eight association studies (seven published and one unpublished) fulfilled criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We also incorporated GWAS data for ADGRL3. In order to avoid overlapping samples, we started with summary statistics from GWAS samples and then added data from gene association studies. The results of our meta-analysis suggest an effect of ADGRL3 variants on ADHD susceptibility in children (n = 8724/14,644 cases/controls and 1893 families): rs6551665 A allele (Z score = −2.701; p = 0.0069); rs1947274 A allele (Z score = −2.033; p = 0.0421); rs1947275 T allele (Z score = 2.339; p = 0.0978); and rs2345039 C allele (Z score = 3.806; p = 0.0026). Heterogeneity was found in analyses for three SNPs (rs6551665, rs1947274, and rs2345039). In adults, results were not significant (n = 6532 cases/15,874 controls): rs6551665 A allele (Z score = 2.005; p = 0.0450); rs1947274 A allele (Z score = 2.179; p = 0.0293); rs1947275 T allele (Z score = −0.822; p = 0.4109); and rs2345039 C allele (Z score = −1.544; p = 0.1226). Heterogeneity was found just for rs6551665. In addition, funnel plots did not suggest publication biases. Consistent with ADGRL3’s role in early neurodevelopment, our findings suggest that the gene is predominantly associated with childhood ADHD."
"Parkinson’s disease (PD) has numerous motor and non-motor symptoms. Among non-motor manifestations impulse control disorders (ICDs) stand out. ICDs include compulsions for gambling, shopping, eating, and sexual behavior, and “related disorders” such as hobbyism, simple motor activities, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. There is no rating scale translated and adapted transculturally into Brazilian Portuguese language. Therefore, we cross-culturally adapted and investigated the measurement properties of the Brazilian version of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS). Fifty-three patients participated in the study. Inter-evaluator and test–retest (patient and health professional) reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient) were all excellent (0.93, 0.93, and 0.99). The internal consistency was high (α = 0.92). The Minimal detectable change (MDC) value was 5.8 (patient) and 2.3 (health professional) points. There was a floor, but no ceiling, effect. In summary, the Brazilian version of the QUIP-RS has high reliability and content validity."
"Background/objectiveTo determine if treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (eAMD) using proton beam therapy (PBT) combined with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is safe and effective long term.Subject/methodsThirty eyes with newly diagnosed eAMD were enrolled in a phase I/II prospective, sham-controlled double-masked university study. Eyes were randomized 1:1:1–24 GyE, 16 GyE or sham radiation, and treated with three initial monthly intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Subsequent anti-VEGF reinjection was based on monthly optical coherence tomography and examination for 2 years and standard of care thereafter.ResultsA total of 23 eyes completed 2-year study follow-up, of which 16 maintained monthly follow-up. Mean best-correct visual acuity (BCVA) at 2 years was similar among treatment groups (p > 0.05). The 24 GyE group required fewer anti-VEGF injections when compared with the sham group at 2 years (4.67 ± 1.9 vs 9.67 ± 3.5; p = 0.017). Extended follow-up (mean 4 years) available in 22 eyes showed persistent reduced need for anti-VEGF therapy among eyes treated with 24 GyE compared with sham radiation (2.0 ± 1.6 vs 4.84 ± 2.4 per year, p = 0.008). New and increasing geographic atrophy (GA), noted in some eyes in all treatment groups, resulted in decreased mean BCVA from baseline for the 24 GyE group on extended follow-up (p = 0.009). Possible mild radiation retinopathy noted in 15% of eyes was not visually significant.ConclusionsInitial treatment combining PBT (24 GyE) with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy appears to decrease the need for anti-VEGF reinjection in eyes with newly diagnosed eAMD. Radiation retinopathy risk was low and does not appear visually significant. Long-term vision was limited by GA development especially in the 24 GyE group."
"Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 8 (SLAMF8) / B-lymphocyte activator macrophage expressed/CD353 is a member of the CD2 family. SLAMF8 suppresses macrophage function but enhances the growth of neoplastic mast cells via SHP-2. In this study, we found that some anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) samples were immunohistochemically positive for SLAMF8. However, we found no significant differences between SLAMF8-positive and SLAMF8-negative ALCL samples with respect to age, gender, site, or prognosis. We also identified SLAMF8 expression in ALCL cell lines, Karpas299, and SU-DHL-1. SLAMF8 knockdown decreased the activation of SHP-2 and the growth of these cell lines, and increased the apoptosis of these cell lines. In addition, we observed the interaction between SLAMF8 and SHP-2 in these cell lines using the DuoLink in situ kit. Taken together, these results suggest that SLAMF8 may enhance the growth of ALCL via SHP-2 interaction."
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS1. Astrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis2, but little is known about the heterogeneity of astrocytes and its regulation. Here we report the analysis of astrocytes in multiple sclerosis and its preclinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with cell-specific Ribotag RNA profiling, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq), genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and in vivo CRISPR–Cas9-based genetic perturbations. We identified astrocytes in EAE and multiple sclerosis that were characterized by decreased expression of NRF2 and increased expression of MAFG, which cooperates with MAT2α to promote DNA methylation and represses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling in astrocytes drives the expression of MAFG and MAT2α and pro-inflammatory transcriptional modules, contributing to CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. Our results identify candidate therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis."
"PKR-like kinase (PERK) plays a significant role in inducing angiogenesis in various cancer types including glioblastoma. By proteomics analysis of the conditioned medium from a glioblastoma cell line treated with a PERK inhibitor, we showed that peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) expression is regulated by PERK under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, PERK activation via CCT020312 (a PERK selective activator) increased the cleavage and thus the generation of PAM cleaved cytosolic domain (PAM sfCD) that acts as a signaling molecule from the cytoplasm to the nuclei. PERK was also found to interact with PAM, suggesting a possible involvement in the generation of PAM sfCD. Knockdown of PERK or PAM reduced the formation of tubes by HUVECs in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo data highlighted the importance of PAM in the growth of glioblastoma with reduction of PAM expression in engrafted tumor significantly increasing the survival in mice. In summary, our data revealed PAM as a potential target for antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma."
"Aggressive cancers often have activating mutations in growth-controlling oncogenes and inactivating mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. In neuroblastoma, amplification of the MYCN oncogene and inactivation of the ATRX tumor-suppressor gene correlate with high-risk disease and poor prognosis. Here we show that ATRX mutations and MYCN amplification are mutually exclusive across all ages and stages in neuroblastoma. Using human cell lines and mouse models, we found that elevated MYCN expression and ATRX mutations are incompatible. Elevated MYCN levels promote metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive-oxygen species generation, and DNA-replicative stress. The combination of replicative stress caused by defects in the ATRX–histone chaperone complex, and that induced by MYCN-mediated metabolic reprogramming, leads to synthetic lethality. Therefore, ATRX and MYCN represent an unusual example, where inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene and activation of an oncogene are incompatible. This synthetic lethality may eventually be exploited to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma."
"ObjectivesAccelerated gain in fat mass (FM) in early life increases the risk for adult diseases. Longitudinal data on infant body composition are crucial for clinical and research use, but very difficult to obtain due to limited measurement tools and unsuccessful measurements between age 6–24 months. We compared FM% by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), with cushion to reduce movement artifacts, with FM% by air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) and evaluated the reliability of this cushion during DXA by comparing FM% with and without cushion. Subsequently, we constructed sex-specific longitudinal body composition charts from 1–24 months.MethodsIn 692 healthy, term-born infants (Sophia Pluto Cohort), FM% was measured by ADP from 1–6 months and DXA with cushion from 6–24 months. At 6 months, FM% was measured in triplicate by ADP and DXA with and without cushion(n = 278), later on in smaller numbers.ResultsAt 6 months, mean FM% by DXA with cushion was 24.1 and by ADP 25.0, mean difference of 0.9% (Bland–Altman p = 0.321, no proportional bias). Mean FM% by DXA without cushion was 12.5% higher compared to ADP (Bland–Altman p < 0.001). DXA without cushion showed higher mean FM% compared to DXA with cushion (+11.6%, p < 0.001) at 6 months. Longitudinally, FM% increased between 1–6 months and decreased from 6–24 months(both p < 0.001).ConclusionsIn infants, DXA scan with cushion limits movement artifacts and shows reliable FM%, comparable to ADP. This allowed us to construct longitudinal body composition charts until 24 months. Our study shows that FM% increases from 1–6 months and gradually declines until 24 months."
"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Since high-dose glucocorticoids might not lead to full recovery of muscle function, physical exercise is also an important intervention, but some exercises exacerbate chronic inflammation and muscle fibrosis. It is unknown how physical exercise can have both beneficial and detrimental effects in chronic myopathy. Here we show that senescence of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) in response to exercise-induced muscle damage is needed to establish a state of regenerative inflammation that induces muscle regeneration. In chronic inflammatory myopathy model mice, exercise does not promote FAP senescence or resistance against tumor necrosis factor–mediated apoptosis. Pro-senescent intervention combining exercise and pharmacological AMPK activation reverses FAP apoptosis resistance and improves muscle function and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the absence of FAP senescence after exercise leads to muscle degeneration with FAP accumulation. FAP-targeted pro-senescent interventions with exercise and pharmacological AMPK activation may constitute a therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory myopathy."
"A multifunctional sensor capable of simultaneous sensing of temperature, pressure, and proximity has been developed. This transparent and body-attachable device is also capable of providing heat under low voltage. The multi-sensor consists of metal fibers fabricated by electrospinning and electroplating. The device comprises randomly deposited metal fibers, which not only provide heating but also perform as thermal and proximity sensors, and orderly aligned metal fibers that act as a pressure sensor. The sensor is fabricated by weaving straight rectangular electrodes on a transparent substrate (a matrix). The sensitivity is readily enhanced by installing numerous matrices that facilitate higher sensing resolution. The convective heat transfer coefficient of the heater is h = 0.014 W·cm−2·°C−1. The temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and pressure sensitivity (ηP) are 0.038 °C−1 and 5.3 × 10−3 kPa−1, respectively. The superior sensitivity of the device is confirmed via quantitative comparison with similar devices. This multifunctional device also has a superior convective heat transfer coefficient than do other heaters reported in the literature."
"Older patients with severe physical trauma are at high risk of developing neuropsychiatric syndromes with global impairment of cognition, attention, and consciousness. We employed a thoracic trauma (TxT) mouse model and thoroughly analyzed age-dependent spatial and temporal posttraumatic alterations in the central nervous system. Up to 5 days after trauma, we observed a transient 50% decrease in the number of excitatory synapses specifically in hippocampal pyramidal neurons accompanied by alterations in attention and motor activity and disruption of contextual memory consolidation. In parallel, hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression was highly upregulated, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were significantly reduced. In vitro experiments revealed that CRH application induced neuronal autophagy with rapid lysosomal degradation of BDNF via the NF-κB pathway. The subsequent synaptic loss was rescued by BDNF as well as by specific NF-κB and CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) antagonists. In vivo, the chronic application of a CRHR1 antagonist after TxT resulted in reversal of the observed histological, molecular, and behavioral alterations. The data suggest that neuropsychiatric syndromes (i.e., delirium) after peripheral trauma might be at least in part due to the activation of the hippocampal CRH/NF-κB/BDNF pathway, which results in a dramatic loss of synaptic contacts. The successful rescue by stress hormone receptor antagonists should encourage clinical trials focusing on trauma-induced delirium and/or other posttraumatic syndromes."
"Strategies to cure HIV-infected patients by virus-targeting drugs have failed to date. We identified a HIV-1-seropositive woman who spontaneously suppressed HIV replication and had normal CD4-cell counts, no HIV-disease, no replication-competent virus and no cell HIV DNA detected with a routine assay. We suspected that dramatic HIV DNA degradation occurred post-infection. We performed multiple nested-PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing and applied a multiplex-PCR approach. Furthermore, we implemented a new technique based on two hybridization steps on beads prior to next-generation sequencing that removed human DNA then retrieved integrated HIV sequences with HIV-specific probes. We assembled ≈45% of the HIV genome and further analyzed the G-to-A mutations putatively generated by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes that can change tryptophan codons into stop codons. We found more G-to-A mutations in the HIV DNA from the woman than in that of her transmitting partner. Moreover, 74% of the tryptophan codons were changed to stop codons (25%) or were deleted as a possible consequence of gene inactivation. Finally, we found that this woman’s cells remained HIV-susceptible in vitro. Our findings show that she does not exhibit innate HIV-resistance but may have been cured of it by extrinsic factors, a plausible candidate for which is the gut microbiota."
"Ongoing social, political and ecological changes in the 21st century have placed more people at risk of life-threatening acute and chronic infections than ever before. The development of new diagnostic, prophylactic, therapeutic and curative strategies is critical to address this burden but is predicated on a detailed understanding of the immensely complex relationship between pathogens and their hosts. Traditional, reductionist approaches to investigate this dynamic often lack the scale and/or scope to faithfully model the dual and co-dependent nature of this relationship, limiting the success of translational efforts. With recent advances in large-scale, quantitative omics methods as well as in integrative analytical strategies, systems biology approaches for the study of infectious disease are quickly forming a new paradigm for how we understand and model host–pathogen relationships for translational applications. Here, we delineate a framework for a systems biology approach to infectious disease in three parts: discovery — the design, collection and analysis of omics data; representation — the iterative modelling, integration and visualization of complex data sets; and application — the interpretation and hypothesis-based inquiry towards translational outcomes."
"The beneficial effects of lipoic acid (LA) in cancer treatment have been well documented in the last decade. Indeed, LA exerts crucial antiproliferative effects by reducing breast cancer cell viability, cell cycle progression and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanisms of action (MOA) underlying these antiproliferative effects remain to be elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that LA decreases breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting IGF-1R maturation via the downregulation of the proprotein convertase furin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the MOA by which LA inhibits furin expression in estrogen receptor α (ERα) (+) and (−) breast cancer cell lines. We unveil that LA exerts a pro-oxidant effect on these cell lines, the resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated being responsible for the reduction in the expression of the major (CREB) protein. This transcription factor is overexpressed in many types of cancers and regulates the expression of furin in breast cancer cells independently of ERα, as evidenced herein by the inhibition of furin expression following CREB silencing. Consequently, our findings expose for the first time the complete MOA of LA via the CREB/furin axis leading to inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation."
"Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is proposed to be effective in reducing pain and improving functional outcome in chronic plantar fasciitis. However, no long-term reports exist on the changes in plantar fascia (PF) elasticity after ESWT. We aimed to evaluate the changes in PF stiffness in patients with plantar fasciitis undergoing ESWT. The visual analogue scale (VAS, 0–100) was used for evaluating heel pain severity. B-mode sonography and strain sonoelastography were used for evaluating the PF thickness and stiffness. The sonoelastogram was analyzed using hue histogram analysis (value: 0–255, from stiffer to softer). All evaluations were recorded before ESWT, and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after ESWT. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare pain VAS, PF thickness, and PF hue value at different follow-up time-points. Twenty-two participants (8 men, 14 women) completed all measurements for 12 months. The VAS of heel pain, PF thickness, and PF hue values at pre-ESWT, and 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month evaluations after ESWT were 62.4 ± 4.2, 49.3 ± 5.8, 38.3 ± 5.7, 27.9 ± 5.3, 18.9 ± 4.7, and 13.2 ± 3.0 (p < 0.01 in all measurements post ESWT versus pre-ESWT); 5.57 ± 0.22 mm, 5.64 ± 0.18 mm, 5.45 ± 0.24 mm, 5.37 ± 0.20 mm, 5.08 ± 0.20 mm, and 4.62 ± 0.15 mm (p < 0.01 at 6-month; otherwise p > 0.05); and 24.5 ± 2.4, 35.2 ± 3.1, 31.0 ± 4.1, 30.5 ± 3.9, 21.4 ± 2.1, and 15.9 ± 1.6 (p < 0.01 at 1-week and 6-month; otherwise p > 0.05), respectively. In conclusion, the heel pain intensity and PF thickness reduced gradually over 12 months after ESWT. The PF stiffness decreased during the first week and increased thereafter; at the 12-month follow-up, stiffness was more than at pre-ESWT."
"Gastric hyperplastic polyps (GHPs) have a potential risk of neoplastic transformation, but the responsible mechanisms have not yet been established. We conducted a study involving 55 patients (33 female) who had undergone endoscopic or surgical resection of GHPs. We compared 16 patients who had GHPs showing neoplastic transformation with 39 patients who had non-neoplastic GHPs. We analyzed differences in serology, gastroscopic manifestations and pathology between the two groups in order to establish risk factors that may be associated with neoplastic transformation. The mean age of the cohort was 61.73 ± 9.024 years. The prevalence of positive serum gastric parietal cell antibody (PCA) was 61.8%. 30 of the GHPs with neoplastic formation had a “strawberry-like” appearance with erosions of polyps (P = 0.000). A history of anaemia was a risk factor for GHPs which demonstrated neoplastic transformation (odds ratio [OR], 3.729; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.099–12.649; P = 0.035). Although the differences were not significant, our data showed higher prevalences of positive serum PCA (P = 0.057), hypergastrinemia (P = 0.062) and female gender (P = 0.146) in the GHP patients who had neoplastic transformation. Multiple polyps in the corpus (P = 0.024) occurred more frequently in serum PCA positive patients. Hypergastrinemia occurred more frequently in Helicobacter pylori negative patients and of these 20/22 patients had a positive PCA (P = 0.007). GHPs are associated with autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG). AMAG is probably one of the risk factors for GHPs to undergo neoplastic transformation."
"Most breast cancer (BC) risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (raSNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are believed to cis-regulate the expression of genes. We hypothesise that cis-regulatory variants contributing to disease risk may be affecting microRNA (miRNA) genes and/or miRNA binding. To test this, we adapted two miRNA-binding prediction algorithms—TargetScan and miRanda—to perform allele-specific queries, and integrated differential allelic expression (DAE) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, to query 150 genome-wide significant (\(P\le 5\times {10}^{-8}\)) raSNPs, plus proxies. We found that no raSNP mapped to a miRNA gene, suggesting that altered miRNA targeting is an unlikely mechanism involved in BC risk. Also, 11.5% (6 out of 52) raSNPs located in 3′-untranslated regions of putative miRNA target genes were predicted to alter miRNA::mRNA (messenger RNA) pair binding stability in five candidate target genes. Of these, we propose RNF115, at locus 1q21.1, as a strong novel target gene associated with BC risk, and reinforce the role of miRNA-mediated cis-regulation at locus 19p13.11. We believe that integrating allele-specific querying in miRNA-binding prediction, and data supporting cis-regulation of expression, improves the identification of candidate target genes in BC risk, as well as in other common cancers and complex diseases."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human health worldwide, and the rapid detection and quantification of resistance, combined with antimicrobial stewardship, are key interventions to combat the spread and emergence of AMR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems are the collective set of diagnostic processes that facilitate the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of AMR and antibiotic susceptibility. Over the past 30 years, only a few high-throughput AST methods have been developed and widely implemented. By contrast, several studies have established proof of principle for various innovative AST methods, including both molecular-based and genome-based methods, which await clinical trials and regulatory review. In this Review, we discuss the current state of AST systems in the broadest technical, translational and implementation-related scope."
"We developed a diet and lifestyle score based on high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and investigated its association with odds of adenoma. We performed stepwise linear regression to develop the predicted hsCRP score among 23,330 participants in the Health Examinee Study and examined its association with colorectal adenoma among 1,711 participants in a cross-sectional study of colorectal adenoma. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of colorectal adenoma using logistic regression models. Variances in hsCRP explained by body mass index were 61.1% in men and 64.5% in women in the prediction model. The increasing predicted hsCRP score was positively associated with colorectal adenoma (ORquartile 4 VS quartile 1 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12–2.62; Ptrend = 0.011 in men; ORquartile 4 VS quartile 1 2.86, 95% CI: 1.26–6.49; Ptrend = 0.019 in women). In subgroups, the associations differed by age and menopausal status among women, with stronger associations among women aged less than 50 years (OR≥median VS <median 3.74, 95% CI: 1.77–7.90, p for interaction 0.014) or premenopausal women (OR≥median vs <median 4.21, 95% CI: 2.12–8.36, p for interaction <0.001). The associations were more pronounced in the advanced or distal colon/rectum in men and in the advanced or proximal colon in women. The associations were attenuated after further adjustment for body mass index. In conclusion, we found that the predicted hsCRP score was positively associated with colorectal adenoma, suggesting that diet and lifestyle lowering inflammation may be a strategy to prevent colorectal neoplasia."
"B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) secretion is stimulated by cardiac dysfunction. However, it is unclear how finely myocardial ischaemia contributes to BNP secretion and whether increases in BNP secretion contribute to coronary vasodilation. This study investigated the direct interaction between plasma BNP levels and cardiac ischaemia using the baseline distal-to-aortic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa). We examined the baseline Pd/Pa and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in 167 patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. The plasma BNP level appeared to be associated with the baseline Pd/Pa in the study population, and this association appeared to become clear only in patients with an FFR ≤ 0.80. To examine the effect of the baseline Pd/Pa on the BNP level in these patients, structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed. The baseline Pd/Pa significantly affected the BNP level (β: −0.37, p = 0.003) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (β: 0.43, p = 0.001). To examine the role of BNP in coronary vasodilation, we proposed another path model using a novel value obtained by dividing the FFR by the baseline Pd/Pa (FFR/baseline Pd/Pa) as an index of the hyperaemic response. The BNP level significantly affected the FFR/baseline Pd/Pa (β: 0.48, p = 0.037). This study demonstrated that BNP finely responded to an exacerbation of cardiac ischaemia and that increases in BNP secretion effectively ameliorated coronary vasoconstriction."
"The best-known role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) in cancer is the metabolic inactivation of drug therapies. By conjugating glucuronic acid to lipophilic drugs, UGTs impair the biological activity and enhance the water solubility of these agents, driving their elimination. Multiple clinical observations support an expanding role for UGTs as modulators of the drug response and in mediating drug resistance in numerous cancer types. However, accumulating evidence also suggests an influence of the UGT pathway on cancer progression. Dysregulation of the expression and activity of UGTs has been associated with the progression of several cancers, arguing for UGTs as possible mediators of oncogenic pathways and/or disease accelerators in a drug-naive context. The consequences of altered UGT activity on tumour biology are incompletely understood. They might be associated with perturbed levels of bioactive endogenous metabolites such as steroids and bioactive lipids that are inactivated by UGTs or through non-enzymatic mechanisms, thereby eliciting oncogenic signalling cascades. This review highlights the evidence supporting dual roles for the UGT pathway, affecting cancer progression and drug resistance. Pharmacogenomic testing of UGT profiles in patients and the development of therapeutic options that impair UGT actions could provide useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers and enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs."
"Chronic nicotine exposure during pregnancy has been shown to induce physiological and anatomical alterations in offspring. Previously, we investigated the complexity of dopamine (DA) neuron firing in the sub-regions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) following perinatal nicotine exposure. Using approximate entropy, we found that within the middle sub-region, the parainterfascicular nucleus (PIF), there was higher complexity indicating more random neural firing and a less homogeneous neuron population. Therefore, we sought to investigate the neuron populations within the sub-regions of the VTA following perinatal nicotine exposure. We used real time PCR in order to find the relative quantity of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), DA, and glutamate neurons within three sub-regions: the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP), parainterfascicular nucleus (PIF), and paranigral nucleus (PN). Our results showed that the PIF region of the VTA contained a more diverse population of neurons resulting in a more complex system. In addition, we found that DA neurons are more activated in PN sub-region of the VTA, which mediates the rewarding effects of drugs including nicotine. Lastly, using immunohistochemistry, we observed an overall decrease in DA neurons following perinatal nicotine exposure."
"BackgroundRiboflavin deficiency confers a predisposition for esophageal cancer. The role of plasma riboflavin levels in development and prognosis of individuals with digestive tract inflammation and ulcer (DTIU), digestive tract polyps (DTPs), and ESCC is not well understood.MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional study, including 177 DTIU, 80 DTP, and 324 ESCC cases, to measure the plasma riboflavin levels among the three populations. Correlation between plasma riboflavin levels (categorized as ≥31.8, 6.5–31.8 and ≤6.5 nmol/L groups) and clinical characteristics, as well as survival of ESCC patients (556 cases) was analyzed.ResultsThere was no difference in plasma riboflavin levels between DTIU, DTP, and ESCC cases (P > 0.05). Plasma riboflavin levels were inversely correlated with invasive depth (correlation coefficient = −0.09, P = 0.026) and lymph node metastasis (correlation coefficient = −0.11, P = 0.010) of ESCC, and ESCC patients with low riboflavin levels had poor recurrence-free survival (P = 0.035) and overall survival (P = 0.003). Decreased riboflavin was a prognostic factor for poor overall survival (HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.19–3.07, P = 0.007).ConclusionsPlasma riboflavin levels in DTIU, DTP, and ESCC patients are similar. Plasma riboflavin levels are associated with the development and prognosis of ESCC."
"ObjectiveTo compare the frequency and severity of neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnancies treated with and without late preterm antenatal corticosteroids.Study designWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of late preterm deliveries at LAC + USC (2015–2018). Neonatal outcomes were compared between pregnancies treated with and without corticosteroids.Results93 pregnancies (39.9%) received corticosteroids and 140 (60.1%) did not. Neonates born to women given corticosteroids were more likely to be hypoglycemic (47.3 vs. 29.3%, ORadj 2.25, padj = 0.01). The mean initial glucose (45.6 mg/dL vs. 51.9 mg/dL, p = 0.01) and glucose nadir (39.1 mg/dL vs. 45.4 mg/dL, p < 0.001) were significantly lower if the neonates received corticosteroids. Neonates admitted to the NICU solely for hypoglycemia were more likely to be born to women treated with corticosteroids (ORadj 4.71, padj = 0.01).ConclusionAdministration of late preterm corticosteroids was associated with an increased incidence and severity of neonatal hypoglycemia."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a rapid decline in renal function and is characterized by excessive renal inflammation and programmed death of resident cells. AKI shows high morbidity and mortality, and severe or repeated AKI can transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD); however, very few effective and specific therapies are available, except for supportive treatment. Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), are significantly altered in AKI models and have been suggested to play critical roles in the repair process of AKI because of their roles in cell regeneration and renal repair. In recent years, a series of studies have shown evidence that growth factors, receptors, and downstream effectors may be highly involved in the mechanism of AKI and may function in the early stage of AKI in response to stimuli by regulating inflammation and programmed cell death. Moreover, certain growth factors or correlated proteins act as biomarkers for AKI due to their sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, growth factors originating from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via paracrine signaling or extracellular vesicles recruit leukocytes or repair intrinsic cells and may participate in AKI repair or the AKI-CKD transition. In addition, growth factor-modified MSCs show superior therapeutic potential compared to that of unmodified controls. In this review, we summarized the current therapeutic and diagnostic strategies targeting growth factors to treat AKI in clinical trials. We also evaluated the possibilities of other growth factor-correlated molecules as therapeutic targets in the treatment of AKI and the AKI-CKD transition."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI), once viewed predominantly as a self-limited and reversible condition, is now recognized as a growing problem associated with significant risks of adverse long-term health outcomes. Many cohort studies have established important relationships between AKI and subsequent risks of recurrent AKI, hospital re-admission, morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as the development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. In both high-income countries (HICs) and low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs), several challenges exist in providing high-quality, patient-centered care following AKI. Despite advances in our understanding about the long-term risks following AKI, large gaps in knowledge remain about effective interventions that can improve the outcomes of patients. Therapies for high blood pressure, glycaemic control (for patients with diabetes), renin–angiotensin inhibition and statins might be important in improving long-term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes after AKI. Novel strategies that incorporate risk stratification approaches, educational interventions and new models of ambulatory care following AKI have been described, and some of these are now being implemented and evaluated in clinical studies in HICs. Care for AKI in LMICs must overcome additional barriers due to limited resources for diagnosis and management."
"Study designRandomized double blind, placebo-controlled trial.ObjectivesTo examine the effect of early intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) on bone markers and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in persons with acute ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) A traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).SettingTwo inpatient rehabilitation units.MethodsThirteen men, 2 women, aged 19–65, C4-T10 AIS A SCI, received 5 mg intravenous ZA vs. placebo 12–21 days post injury. Markers of bone formation (procollagen N-1 terminal propeptide [P1NP]), bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide [CTX]), and aBMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for hip (femur—proximal, intertrochanteric, neck), and knee (distal femur, proximal tibia) were obtained at baseline, 2 weeks post infusion (P1NP, CTX only), 4 and 12 months post injury.ResultsP1NP remained unchanged, while CTX decreased in ZA but increased in controls at 2 weeks (mean difference = −97%, p < 0.01), 4 months (mean difference = −54%, p < 0.05), but not 12 months (mean difference = 3%, p = 0.23). Changes in aBMD at the hip favored ZA at 4 months (mean difference 10.3–14.1%, p < 0.01) and 12 months (mean difference 10.8–13.1%, p < 0.02). At 4 months, changes in aBMD favored ZA at the distal femur (mean difference 6.0%, 95% CI: 0.7–11.2, p < 0.03) but not proximal tibia (mean difference 8.3%, 95% CI: −6.9 to 23.6, p < 0.23). Both groups declined in aBMD at 12 months, with no between group differences.ConclusionZA administered ≤21 days of complete traumatic SCI maintains aBMD at the hip and distal femur at 4 months post injury. This effect is partially maintained at 12 months."
"ObjectiveTo evaluate potential differences and to show the risk associated with small for gestational age (SGA) at birth and discharge among infants born to mothers of various Asian/Pacific islander (PI) races.Study designIn this retrospective cohort study, infants with weight <1500 g or 23–28 weeks gestation, born in California during 2008–2012 were included. Logistic regression models were used.ResultsAsian and PI infants in ten groups had significant differences in growth parameters, socioeconomic factors, and some morbidities. Overall incidences of SGA at birth and discharge were 21% and 50%, respectively; Indian race had the highest numbers (29%, 63%). Infants of parents with the same race were at increased risk of SGA at birth and discharge compared with mixed race parents.ConclusionSpecific Asian race should be considered when evaluating preterm growth. Careful consideration for the appropriateness of grouping Asian/PI races together in perinatal studies is warranted."
"Ancillary testing during the initial workup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is largely performed using aspirated materials. We utilized multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF) imaging with digital image analysis to perform an in situ analysis of the microenvironment in NPM1-mutated AML using diagnostic bone marrow biopsy tissues (N = 17) and correlated these findings with diagnostic next-generation sequencing (NGS, N = 17), flow cytometry (FC, N = 14), and first remission (CR1) NPM1-specific molecular MRD (n = 16) data. The total CD3-positive T-cell percentages correlated positively between FC and MIF (r = 0.53, p = 0.05), but were significantly lower by MIF (1.62% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.009). The percentage of mutant NPM1-positive (NPM1c+) cells ranged from 9.7 to 90.8% (median 45.4%) and did not correlate with the NPM1 mutant allele fraction by NGS (p > 0.05). The percentage of CD34+/NPM1c+ cells ranged from 0 to 1.8% (median 0.07%). The percentage of NPM1c+ cells correlated inversely (34% vs. 62%, p = 0.03), while the percentages of CD3−/NPM1c− cells (64% vs. 35%, p = 0.03), and specifically CD3−/CD4−/NPM1c− cells (26% vs. 13%, p = 0.04), correlated positively with subsequent MRD. Discordances between MIF and FC/NGS data suggest that aspirate materials are likely an imperfect reflection of the core biopsy tissue. Furthermore, increased numbers of NPM1 wild-type cells within the microenvironment at diagnosis correlate with the subsequent presence of MRD."
"The poor prognosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients is due to progression and targeted drug resistance, but the underlying molecular mechanisms need further elucidation. This study examined the biological function and related mechanisms of gankyrin in ccRCC based on the results of our previous study. To this end, in vitro functional experiments; in vivo models of subcutaneous tumor formation, lung metastasis, and orthotopic ccRCC; and antibody chip detection, co-IP, ChIP assays were performed to examine the biological role and molecular mechanisms of gankyrin in ccRCC. Two hundred fifty-six ccRCC patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts to examine the prognostic value of gankyrin and other markers through IHC and statistical analyses. We observed that the gankyrin-overexpressing ccRCC cell lines 786-O and 769-P exhibited increased proliferation, invasion, migration, tumorigenicity, and pazopanib resistance and decreased apoptosis, while gankyrin knockdown achieved the opposite results. Mechanistically, gankyrin recruited STAT3 via direct binding, and STAT3 binding to the CCL24 promoter promoted its expression. Reciprocally, an increase in autocrine CCL24 enhanced the expression of gankyrin and STAT3 activation via CCR3 in ccRCC, forming a positive autocrine-regulatory loop. Furthermore, in vivo experimental results revealed that blocking the positive loop through gankyrin knockdown or treatment with the CCR3 inhibitor SB328437 reversed the resistance to pazopanib and inhibited lung metastasis in ccRCC. Moreover, a positive correlation between gankyrin and STAT3 or CCL24 expression in ccRCC specimens was observed, and improved accuracy for ccRCC patient prognosis was achieved by combining gankyrin and STAT3 or CCL24 expression with existing clinical prognostic indicators, including the TNM stage and SSIGN score. In summary, targeting the gankyrin/STAT3/CCL24/CCR3 autocrine-regulatory loop may serve as a remedy for patients with advanced ccRCC, and combining gankyrin and STAT3 or CCL24 expression with the current clinical indicators better predicts ccRCC patient prognosis."
"This meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether the extant literature justifies any definitive conclusions about whether and how SITBs may be associated with brain differences. A total of 77 papers (N = 4,903) published through January 1, 2019 that compared individuals with and without SITBs were included, resulting in 882 coordinates. A pooled meta-analysis assessing for general risk for SITBs indicated a lack of convergence on structural differences. When all types of control groups were considered, functional differences in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right amygdala, left hippocampus, and right thalamus were significant using multi-level kernel density analysis (pcorrected < 0.05) but nonsignificant using activation-likelihood estimation. These results suggest that a propensity for internally-oriented, emotional processing coupled with under-active pain processing could potentially underlie SITBs, but additional research is needed to test this possibility. Separate analyses for types of SITBs suggested that the brain differences associated with deliberate self-harm were consistent with the overall findings. Checkered moderator effects were detected. Overall, the meta-analytic evidence was not robust. More studies are needed to reach definitive conclusions about whether SITBs are associated with brain differences."
"Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy—a class of disorders in which the tau protein forms insoluble inclusions in the brain—that is characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances1,2,3. The H1 haplotype of MAPT (the tau gene) is present in cases of CBD at a higher frequency than in controls4,5, and genome-wide association studies have identified additional risk factors6. By histology, astrocytic plaques are diagnostic of CBD7,8; by SDS–PAGE, so too are detergent-insoluble, 37 kDa fragments of tau9. Like progressive supranuclear palsy, globular glial tauopathy and argyrophilic grain disease10, CBD is characterized by abundant filamentous tau inclusions that are made of isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats11,12,13,14,15. This distinguishes such ‘4R’ tauopathies from Pick’s disease (the filaments of which are made of three-repeat (3R) tau isoforms) and from Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) (in which both 3R and 4R isoforms are found in the filaments)16. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to analyse the structures of tau filaments extracted from the brains of three individuals with CBD. These filaments were identical between cases, but distinct from those seen in Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease and CTE17,18,19. The core of a CBD filament comprises residues lysine 274 to glutamate 380 of tau, spanning the last residue of the R1 repeat, the whole of the R2, R3 and R4 repeats, and 12 amino acids after R4. The core adopts a previously unseen four-layered fold, which encloses a large nonproteinaceous density. This density is surrounded by the side chains of lysine residues 290 and 294 from R2 and lysine 370 from the sequence after R4."
"Impaired thermoregulation and lowered average daily gains (ADG) result when livestock graze toxic endophyte (Epichloë coenophialum)-infected tall fescue (E+) and are hallmark signs of fescue toxicosis (FT), a disease exacerbated by increased temperature and humidity (+temperature-humidity index; +THI). We previously reported FT is associated with metabolic and microbiota perturbations under thermoneutral conditions; here, we assessed the influence of E+ grazing and +THI on the microbiota:metabolome interactions. Using high-resolution metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, plasma/urine metabolomes and the fecal microbiota of Angus steers grazing non-toxic or E+ tall fescue were evaluated in the context of +THI. E+ grazing affected the fecal microbiota profile; +THI conditions modulated the microbiota only in E+ steers. E+ also perturbed many metabolic pathways, namely amino acid and inflammation-related metabolism; +THI affected these pathways only in E+ steers. Integrative analyses revealed the E+ microbiota correlated and co-varied with the metabolomes in a THI-dependent manner. Operational taxonomic units in the families Peptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Ruminococcaceae correlated with production parameters (e.g., ADG) and with multiple plasma/urine metabolic features, providing putative FT biomarkers and/or targets for the development of FT therapeutics. Overall, this study suggests that E+ grazing increases Angus steer susceptibility to +THI, and offers possible targets for FT interventions."
"Novel molecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) are continuously being discovered, including epigenetic regulation. Among epigenetic marks, the role of DNA hypomethylation in shaping heart morphology and function in vivo and the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy and/or HF, especially in adults, has not been clearly established. Here we show that the strong expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is obviously downregulated in the WT adult rat heart with age. By contrast, the expression of Dnmt1 is upregulated suddenly in heart tissues from pressure overload-induced HF mice and adriamycin-induced cardiac injury and HF mice, consistent with the increased expression of Dnmt1 observed in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) patients. To further assess the role of Dnmt1, we generated myocardium-specific Dnmt1 knockout (Dnmt1 KO) rats using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Echocardiographic and histopathological examinations demonstrated that Dnmt1 deficiency is associated with resistance to cardiac pathological changes and protection at the global and organization levels in response to pathological stress. Furthermore, Dnmt1 deficiency in the myocardium restricts the expressional reprogramming of genes and activates pathways involved in myocardial protection and anti-apoptosis in response to pathological stress. Transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses revealed that these changes in regulation are linked to alterations in the methylation status of genes due to Dnmt1 knockout. The present study is the first to investigate in vivo the impact of genome-wide cardiac DNA methyltransferase deficiency on physiological development and the pathological processes of heart tissues in response to stress. The exploration of the role of epigenetics in the development, modification, and prevention of cardiomyopathy and HF is in a very preliminary stage but has an infinite future."
"HIV infection can be effectively treated by lifelong administration of combination antiretroviral therapy, but an effective vaccine will likely be required to end the HIV epidemic. Although the majority of current vaccine strategies focus on the induction of neutralizing antibodies, there is substantial evidence that cellular immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells can sustain long-term disease-free and transmission-free HIV control and may be harnessed to induce both therapeutic and preventive antiviral effects. In this Review, we discuss the increasing evidence derived from individuals who spontaneously control infection without antiretroviral therapy as well as preclinical immunization studies that provide a clear rationale for renewed efforts to develop a CD8+ T cell-based HIV vaccine in conjunction with B cell vaccine efforts. Further, we outline the remaining challenges in translating these findings into viable HIV prevention, treatment and cure strategies."
"The ability of breast cancer cells to interconvert between epithelial and mesenchymal states contributes to their metastatic potential. As opposed to cell autonomous effects, the impact of epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) on primary and metastatic tumor microenvironments remains poorly characterized. Herein we utilize global gene expression analyses to characterize a metastatic model of EMP as compared to their non-metastatic counterparts. Using this approach, we demonstrate that upregulation of the extracellular matrix crosslinking enzyme tissue transglutaminase-2 (TG2) is part of a novel gene signature that only emerges in metastatic cells that have undergone induction and reversion of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consistent with our model system, patient survival is diminished when primary tumors demonstrate enhanced levels of TG2 in conjunction with its substrate, fibronectin. Targeted depletion of TG2 inhibits metastasis, while overexpression of TG2 is sufficient to enhance this process. In addition to being present within cells, we demonstrate a robust increase in the amount of TG2 and crosslinked fibronectin present within extracellular vesicle (EV) fractions derived from metastatic breast cancer cells. Confocal microscopy of these EVs suggests that FN undergoes fibrillogenesis on their surface via a TG2 and Tensin1-dependent process. Upon in vivo administration, the ability of tumor-derived EVs to induce metastatic niche formation and enhance subsequent pulmonary tumor growth requires the presence and activity of TG2. Finally, we develop a novel 3D model of the metastatic niche to demonstrate that conditioning of pulmonary fibroblasts via pretreatment with tumor-derived EVs promotes subsequent growth of breast cancer cells in a TG2-dependent fashion. Overall, our studies illustrate a novel mechanism through which EMP contributes to metastatic niche development and distant metastasis via tumor-derived EVs containing aberrant levels of TG2 and fibrillar FN."
"Both hydrostatic and osmotic pressures are altered in the tumour microenvironment. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumour with high invasiveness and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that physical and osmotic forces regulate glioblastoma (GBM) invasiveness. The osmotic pressure of GBM cell culture medium was adjusted using sodium chloride or water. Alternatively, cells were subjected to increased hydrostatic force. The proteolytic profile and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) were investigated using zymography and real-time qPCR. The EMT markers assessed were Snail-1, Snail-2, N-cadherin, Twist and vimentin. Invasion was investigated in vitro using extracellular matrix-coated Transwell inserts. In response to osmotic and mechanical pressure, GBM cell lines U87 and U251 and patient-derived neural oncospheres upregulated the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and/or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as some of the EMT markers tested. The adherent cell lines invaded more when placed in media of increased osmolality. Therefore, GBM respond to osmotic or mechanical pressure by increasing matrix degrading enzyme production, and adopting a phenotype reminiscent of EMT. Better understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which increased pressure promotes GBM invasiveness may help to develop innovative therapeutic approaches."
"The pathogenesis of DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient endometrial carcinoma (EC) is driven by inactivating methylation or less frequently mutation of an MMR gene (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, or MSH6). This study evaluated the prognostic and clinicopathologic differences between methylation-linked and nonmethylated MMR-deficient endometrioid ECs. We performed MMR immunohistochemistry and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and classified 682 unselected endometrioid ECs as MMR proficient (MMRp, n = 438) and MMR deficient (MMRd, n = 244), with the latter subcategorized as methylated (MMRd Met) and nonmethylated tumors. Loss of MMR protein expression was detected in 35.8% of the tumors as follows: MLH1 + PMS2 in 29.8%, PMS2 in 0.9%, MSH2 + MSH6 in 1.3%, MSH6 in 2.8%, and multiple abnormalities in 0.9%. Of the 244 MMRd cases, 76% were methylation-linked. MMR deficiency was associated with older age, high grade of differentiation (G3), advanced stage (II–IV), larger tumor size, abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 positivity in immune cells and combined positive score, wild-type p53, negative L1CAM, ARID1A loss, and type of adjuvant therapy. MMRd-Met phenotype correlated with older age and larger tumor size, and predicted diminished disease-specific survival in the whole cohort. In the MMRd subgroup, univariate analysis demonstrated an association between disease-specific survival and disease stage II–IV, high grade (G3), deep myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, ER negativity, and L1CAM positivity. In conclusion, MMR methylation profile correlates with clinicopathologic characteristics of endometrioid EC, and MMRd-Met phenotype predicts lower disease-specific survival. MMR deficiency, but not MLH1 methylation status, correlates with T-cell inflammation and PD-L1 expression."
"The ATM kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and a well-established tumour suppressor whose loss is the cause of the neurodegenerative and cancer-prone syndrome Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T). A-T patients and Atm−/− mouse models are particularly predisposed to develop lymphoid cancers derived from deficient repair of RAG-induced DSBs during V(D)J recombination. Here, we unexpectedly find that specifically disturbing the repair of DSBs produced by DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) by genetically removing the highly specialised repair enzyme TDP2 increases the incidence of thymic tumours in Atm−/− mice. Furthermore, we find that TOP2 strongly colocalizes with RAG, both genome-wide and at V(D)J recombination sites, resulting in an increased endogenous chromosomal fragility of these regions. Thus, our findings demonstrate a strong causal relationship between endogenous TOP2-induced DSBs and cancer development, confirming these lesions as major drivers of ATM-deficient lymphoid malignancies, and potentially other conditions and cancer types."
To investigate mortality in periviable neonates ≤23 weeks gestational age and calculate its impact on overall neonatal mortality rate over a 12-year period (1998–2009). Verify if periviable mortality decreased in the period (2010–2015). Retrospective review. Neonatal mortality rate per 1000 live births was 11.4. Three hundred forty-nine live birth infants weighed ≤500 g and 336 died. Their proportion to the total neonatal mortality rate was 48.6%; out of 298 periviables 146 (43%) were ≤20 weeks gestational age. In 269 (80%) we could not determine the cause of death. Two hundred ninety-seven neonates (88.3%) died in the delivery room. Sixteen (5%) had an autopsy. Neonatal mortality rate from periviability was 96.2% and constituted half of the overall rate in the period (1998–2009). There was not significant reduction of periviable mortality between 2010 and 2015. Current live birth definition and a reporting system that considers a 100 g periviable live birth infant as a neonatal death has placed Ohio and the United States at a significant disadvantage compared to other countries using different reporting systems.
"Radar systems allow for contactless measurements of vital signs such as heart sounds, the pulse signal, and respiration. This approach is able to tackle crucial disadvantages of state-of-the-art monitoring devices such as the need for permanent wiring and skin contact. Potential applications include the employment in a hospital environment but also in home care or passenger vehicles. This dataset consists of synchronised data which are acquired using a Six-Port-based radar system operating at 24 GHz, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and a respiration sensor. 11 test subjects were measured in different defined scenarios and at several measurement positions such as at the carotid, the back, and several frontal positions on the thorax. Overall, around 223 minutes of data were acquired at scenarios such as breath-holding, post-exercise measurements, and while speaking. The presented dataset contains reference-labeled ECG signals and can therefore easily be used to either test algorithms for monitoring the heart rate, but also to gain insights about characteristic effects of radar-based vital sign monitoring."
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in cancer biology, but their functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain unexplored. Full length of circRNA_002581 was amplified and sequenced, followed by RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA-Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization and dual luciferase reporter gene analysis to confirm the existence of the circRNA_002581–miR-122–CPEB1 regulatory axis in vitro. CircRNA_002581 knockdown was used to study its roles in high concentration of free fatty acids-induced NASH-like cell model and a methionine and choline deficiency (MCD) diet-induced NASH mice model. Autophagy flux and related potential PTEN–AMPK–mTOR pathway were tested by western blot. CircRNA_002581 overexpression significantly relieved the inhibitory role of miR-122 on its target CPEB1 by sponging miR-122. CircRNA_002581 knockdown markedly attenuated lipid droplet accumulation, reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, H2O2, and increased ATP level in both mice and cellular models of NASH. Mechanistically, circRNA_002581 interference significantly rescue the defective autophagy evidenced by increased autophagosome number, upregulated LC3-II/I level, and decreased p62 level. Further chloroquine-mediated total autophagy inhibition antagonizes the protective effect of circRNA_002581 knockdown. Finally, CPEB1–PTEN–AMPK–mTOR pathway is shown to link the autophagy and circRNA_002581 knockdown-mediated NASH alleviation. CircRNA_002581–miR-122–CPEB1 axis actively participates in the pathogenesis of NASH through PTEN–AMPK–mTOR pathway-related autophagy suppression. Targeting circRNA_002581 is a potential therapeutic strategy for NASH through partial autophagy restoration."
"Vaccinating dogs against rabies is an effective means of reducing human rabies. We subjected 1327 clinically diagnosed human rabies death and mass dog vaccination (MDV) data during 2006–2018 to quantify the impacts of MDV on human rabies incidence in Bangladesh and a subset of rabies death data (422) for clinico-epidemiological analysis. A positive and increasing trend of MDV (p = 0.01 and tau = 0.71) and a negative and declining trend (p < 0.001 and tau = −0.88) of human rabies cases (Correlation coefficient: −0.82) have been observed. Among 422 deaths, the majority (78%) of the victims sought treatment from traditional healers, and 12% received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The mean incubation period of rabies in cases with exposure sites on the head & neck (35 days) was shorter than the upper limb (mean = 64 days, p = 0.02) and lower limb (mean = 89 days, p < 0.01). MDV has been found to be effective for reducing human rabies cases in Bangladesh. Creating awareness among the animal bite victims to stop reliance on traditional healers rather seeking PEP, addressing the role of traditional healers through awareness education programme with respect to the treatment of dog bites, ensuring availability of PEP, and continuing to scale up MDV may help to prevent human rabies deaths."
"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a complex disease consisting of various components including steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning degeneration, with or without fibrosis. Therefore, it is difficult to diagnose NASH with only one imaging modality. This study was aimed to evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting NASH and to develop a non-invasive multiparametric MR index for the detection of NASH in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. This prospective study included 47 NAFLD patients who were scheduled to undergo or underwent ultrasound-guided liver biopsy within 2 months. Biopsy specimens were graded as NASH or non-NASH. All patients underwent non-enhanced MRI including MR spectroscopy (MRS), MR elastography (MRE), and T1 mapping. Diagnostic performances of MRS, MRE, and T1 mapping for grading steatosis, activity, and fibrosis were evaluated. A multiparametric MR index combining fat fraction (FF), liver stiffness (LS) value, and T1 relaxation time was developed using linear regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the newly devised MR index. Twenty NASH patients and 27 non-NASH patients were included. Using MRS, MRE, and T1 mapping, the mean areas under the curve (AUCs) for grading steatosis, fibrosis, and activity were 0.870, 0.951, and 0.664, respectively. The multiparametric MR index was determined as 0.037 × FF (%) + 1.4 × LS value (kPa) + 0.004 × T1 relaxation time (msec) −3.819. ROC curve analysis of the MR index revealed an AUC of 0.883. The cut-off value of 6 had a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 85.2%. The multiparametric MR index combining FF, LS value, and T1 relaxation time showed high diagnostic performance for detecting NASH in NAFLD patients."
"A successful pregnancy requires sophisticated regulation of uterine microenvironment to guarantee the existence of semi-allogeneic conceptus without immune rejection. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells exert a suppressive effect on Tfh-cell expansion, B-cell response, and antibody production. Although accumulating evidence has demonstrated that dysregulations of Tfr cells can bring on various immunological diseases, their immunomodulatory roles during pregnancy still remain unheeded. Herein, we introduced an allogeneic normal-pregnant mouse model and found that CD4+CXCR5hiPD-1hiFoxp3+ Tfr cells were preferentially accumulated in the uterus at mid-gestation and displayed a distinct phenotype. In addition, the absence of PDL1 resulted in increased fetal resorption by favoring Tfr cells accumulation and upregulating PD-1 expression on these cells. However, PDL1 blockade affected neither the ratio of Tfh/Tfr cells nor the maturation and differentiation of B cells. Overall, our results are the first to present a correlation of Tfr cells accumulation with healthy allogeneic pregnancy and PDL1 blockade-induced miscarriage, and to indicate that appropriate assembly of Tfr cells is important for pregnancy maintenance. Since blockade of PD-1-PDL1 pathway leads to more Tfr cells and fetal losses, the reproductive safety must be taken into consideration when PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy is used in pregnancy."
"BackgroundCixutumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting insulin-like growth factor I receptor, did not improve undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rate at 28 weeks when combined with androgen deprivation in the randomized phase II SWOG S0925 trial for patients with new metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. We now present mature survival analyses, along with pre-specified secondary and exploratory endpoints.MethodsWe randomized 210 patients to androgen deprivation with or without cixutumumab, 105 per treatment arm. We used Kaplan–Meier curves to analyze overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, and castration resistance-free survival by treatment arm, disease volume, and risk group. We explored differences in survival by treatment arm via covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for disease volume and risk.ResultsNo difference was seen between treatment arms in overall survival (HR 1.01 [0.70–1.45]; p = 0.97), radiographic progression-free survival (HR 1.17 [0.85–1.60]; p = 0.35), or castration resistance-free survival (HR 1.02 [0.75–1.41]; p = 0.88). At baseline, 105/198 (53.0%) patients had high-risk features and 119/210 (56.7%) had high-volume disease; 16.7% of patients had discordant classifications of high or low category for risk and volume. Adjusting for risk or volume yielded no differences in overall survival between arms. Inferior survival was observed in high-risk (HR 1.89 [1.29–2.80]; p = 0.001) and high-volume (HR 2.75 [1.84–4.10]; p < 0.0001) disease. Disease volume was a better fit to survival data than risk group (AIC 878.3 vs. 889.2). Compared to patients achieving undetectable PSA at 28 weeks, inferior survival was observed in patients whose PSA was >0.2 to ≤4.0 ng/mL (HR 3.72 [1.99–6.95]; p < 0.0001) or >4.0 ng/mL (HR 7.13 [4.24–11.9]; p < 0.0001).ConclusionsIn new metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, addition of cixutumumab to androgen deprivation did not improve survival. Baseline risk and disease volume carried prognostic value for this distinct trial population, although disease volume added more prognostic information. PSA treatment response was a strong intermediate endpoint for survival."
"Although postoperative cholangioscopy (POC) guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) is considered to be a conventional technique for residual biliary calculi, its efficacy still needs to be improved to fit in the managemet of refractory calculi. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined lithotripsy of mechanical clamping and electrohydraulics in fragmentation and removal of refractory calculi. Totally, 281 patients, who suffered from residual biliary calculi after hepatectomy and underwnet POC from August 2016 to June 2018 were involved. The first 128 patients were subjected to conventional EHL, and later consective 153 to combined lithotripsyof mechanical clamping and EHL. Perioperative data, technical information, treatment outcomes and follow-up results were collected. Clinical characteristics were statistically comparable (P > 0.05). The overall POC interventional sessions (2.0 ± 0.65 vs. 2.9 ± 1.21 sessions), average operating time (99.1 ± 34.88 vs. 128.6 ± 72.87 minutes), incidence of intraoperative hemobilia (4.58% vs. 10.93%), cholangitis (6.54% vs. 14.06%), postoperative complications (10.45% vs. 21.87%), T-tube retaining time after first POC (20.7 ± 5.35 vs. 28.1 ± 8.28 days), and treatment costs ($2375 ± 661.72 vs. $3456.7 ± 638.07) were significantly lower in the combined lithotripsy group than those in the EHL group (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the two groups in calculi recurrence at half-a year, or one year follow-up. In conclusion, combined lithotripsy of mechanical clamping and electrohydraulics can safely and effectively benefit postoperative patients along with refractory residual biliary calculi."
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) accounts for nearly one fifth of all childhood cancers and current challenges in B-ALL treatment include resistance, relapse and late-onset side effects due to the chemotherapy. To overcome these hurdles, novel therapies need to be investigated. One promising target is Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a key regulator of the cell cycle. In this study, the Plk family expression is investigated in primary peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from ten pediatric B-ALL patients. For the first time, short interfering RiboNucleic Neutrals (siRNNs) that enter cells without a transfection reagent are used to target Plk1 mRNA in primary cells from pediatric B-ALL patients. Our results show that the expression of Plk1 and Plk4 is significantly higher in pediatric B-ALL patients compared to healthy donors. Moreover, treatment of primary peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from pediatric B-ALL patients, cultured ex vivo, with Plk1-targeting siRNNs results in cleavage of Plk1 mRNA. Importantly, the Plk1 knockdown is specific and does not affect other Plk members in contrast to many small molecule Plk1 inhibitors. Thus, Plk1 is a potential therapeutic target in pediatric B-ALL and selective targeting of Plk1 can be achieved by the use of siRNNs."
"While the past decade has seen meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes for multiple myeloma patients, a subset of patients does not benefit from current therapeutics for unclear reasons. Many gene expression-based models of risk have been developed, but each model uses a different combination of genes and often involves assaying many genes making them difficult to implement. We organized the Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, a crowdsourced effort to develop models of rapid progression in newly diagnosed myeloma patients and to benchmark these against previously published models. This effort lead to more robust predictors and found that incorporating specific demographic and clinical features improved gene expression-based models of high risk. Furthermore, post-challenge analysis identified a novel expression-based risk marker, PHF19, which has recently been found to have an important biological role in multiple myeloma. Lastly, we show that a simple four feature predictor composed of age, ISS, and expression of PHF19 and MMSET performs similarly to more complex models with many more gene expression features included."
"Mutations in non-coding DNA regions are increasingly recognized as cancer drivers. These mutations can modify gene expression in cis or by inducing high-order chormatin structure modifications with long-range effects. Previous analysis reported the detection of recurrent and functional non-coding DNA mutations in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) genome, such as those in the 3′ untranslated region of NOTCH1 and in the PAX5 super-enhancer. In this report, we used whole genome sequencing data produced by the International Cancer Genome Consortium in order to analyze regions with previously reported regulatory activity. This approach enabled the identification of numerous recurrently mutated regions that were frequently positioned in the proximity of genes involved in immune and oncogenic pathways. By correlating these mutations with expression of their nearest genes, we detected significant transcriptional changes in genes such as PHF2 and S1PR2. More research is needed to clarify the function of these mutations in CLL, particularly those found in intergenic regions."
"Scalp nerve block with ropivacaine has been shown to provide perioperative analgesia. However, the best concentration of ropivacaine is still unknown for optimal analgesic effects. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the effects of scalp nerve block with varied concentration of ropivacaine on postoperative pain and intraoperative hemodynamic variables in patients undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia. Eighty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive scalp block with either 0.2% ropivacaine, 0.33% ropivacaine, 0.5% ropivacaine, or normal saline. Intraoperative hemodynamics and post-operative pain scores at 2, 4, 6, 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. We found that scalp blockage with 0.2% and 0.33% ropivacaine provided adequate postoperative pain relief up to 2 h, while administration of 0.5% ropivacaine had a longer duration of action (up to 4 hour after craniotomy). Scalp nerve block with varied concentration of ropivacaine blunted the increase of mean arterial pressure in response to noxious stimuli during incision, drilling, and sawing skull bone. 0.2% and 0.5% ropivacaine decreased heart rate response to incision and drilling. We concluded that scalp block using 0.5% ropivacaine obtain preferable postoperative analgesia compared to lower concentrations. And scalp block with ropivacaine also reduced hemodynamic fluctuations in craniotomy operations."
"Meniscus pathology may promote early osteoarthritis. This study assessed human meniscus functionality (i.e. its response to loading) ex vivo based on quantitative T1, T1ρ, and T2 mapping as a function of histological degeneration and loading. Forty-five meniscus samples of variable degeneration were harvested from the lateral meniscus body region of 45 patients during total knee arthroplasties. Samples underwent serial mapping on a 3.0-T MRI scanner (Achieva, Philips) using a force-controlled and torque-inducing compressive loading device. Samples were measured at three loading positions, i.e. unloaded, loaded to 2 bar (compression force 37 N) and 4 bar (69 N). Histology (Pauli classification) and biomechanics (Elastic Modulus) served as references. Based on histology, samples were trichotomized as grossly intact (n = 14), mildly degenerative (n = 16), and moderate-to-severely degenerative (n = 15) and analyzed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests. For T1, we found loading-induced decreases in all samples, irrespective of degeneration. For T1ρ, zonal increases in intact (apex) and decreases in degenerative samples (base) were found, while for T2, changes were ambiguous. In conclusion, force-controlled loading and serial MR imaging reveal response-to-loading patterns in meniscus. Zonal T1ρ response-to-loading patterns are most promising in differentiating degeneration, while T1 and T2 aren’t clearly related to degeneration.and may provide an imaging-based indication of functional tissue properties."
"Lumbar degenerative disc diseases cause low back pain (LBP). The maintenance of the height and stability of the intervertebral disc (IVD) space is an effective treatment for LBP. The following study evaluated the effects of fibroblast injection on intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) in a preclinical setting. Compared with the IDD group, the fibroblast treatment group demonstrated effective maintenance of IVD height, reduced endplate degeneration, and improved nuclear magnetic resonance signals and overall histological structure. In doing so, fibrotic IVDs maintained the stability and biomechanics of the vertebra. This finding is in agreement with clinical findings that human nucleus pulposus (NP) fibrosis is essential for the maintenance of IVD height and mechanical properties in patients following percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that injected fibroblasts not only proliferated but also induced NP cells to adopt a fibrotic phenotype via the secretion of TGF-β. Finally, to better mimic human conditions, the efficacy of autologous fibroblast injection in the treatment of IDD was further examined in a nonhuman primate cynomolgus monkey model due to their capacity for upright posture. We showed that the injection of fibroblasts could maintain the IVD height and rescue IVD signals in cynomolgus monkeys. Taken together, the results of our study reveal that autologous fibroblast injection can enhance the natural process of fibrosis during acute and subacute stages of stress-induced IDD. Fibrotic IVDs can maintain the stability, biological activity, and mechanical properties of the intervertebral space, thus providing a new direction for the treatment of intervertebral space-derived lumbar degenerative diseases."
"Since electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are considered less toxic than conventional tobacco smoking, the use of e-cigarettes has increased, and the market for e-cigarette liquids (e-liquids) is continuously increasing. However, many studies showed that e-cigarettes may cause various harmful effects in lung, oral and heart. In this study, we investigated the effects of e-liquids on otitis media (OM) using human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs). Menthol-flavored e-liquid induced significant cell death in HMEECs (IC50: 1.45 ± 0.14%) and tobacco-flavored e-liquid led to increase in inflammatory cytokine levels and higher mucin production. Flavored e-liquids decreased the mRNA levels of genes encoding epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in HMEECs. Apoptosis and autophagy reactions were induced by exposure of HMEECs to menthol- and tobacco-flavored e-liquids. Tobacco-flavored e-liquids caused a greater increase in the levels of autophagosome marker, LC3-II, compared to menthol-flavored e-liquids, which was followed by cell death. These results demonstrate that flavored e-liquids cause cytotoxicity via apoptosis, autophagy, inflammatory response, and mucin production in HMEECs. The flavors present in e-liquids might be a risk factor for the development of otitis media."
"ObjectiveTo evaluate mortality and short-term morbidities in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (<1000 g) in a birth cohort in North India.MethodsIn-hospital data of 231 ELBW infants (Jan 2013 to Sept 2018) were collected from a prospectively maintained electronic database by using standard definitions.ResultsThe mean (SD) gestation and birth weight were 27.9 (2.2) weeks and 783 (133) g, respectively. Major morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome (n = 132, 57%), moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 62, 26.8%), hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (n = 65, 28%), intracranial hemorrhage ≥ grade II (n = 38, 16%), and culture-positive sepsis (n = 44, 19%). Median (IQR) duration of hospital stay (survivors) was 50 (17–79) days. The overall survival was 62%. On logistic regression, severe birth asphyxia, gestation ≤26 weeks, and respiratory distress syndrome were major predictors of mortality.ConclusionIn the current ELBW cohort, nearly two-thirds survived until discharge, who had considerable morbidities needing prolonged hospital stay. This study can be utilized for counseling and planning of care of ELBW infants in similar settings."
"Despite the introduction of novel targeted therapies, chemotherapy still remains the primary treatment for metastatic melanoma in poorly funded healthcare environments or in case of disease relapse, with no reliable molecular markers for progression-free survival (PFS) available. As chemotherapy primarily eliminates cancer cells by apoptosis, we here evaluated if the expression of key apoptosis regulators (Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Smac, Procaspase-9, Apaf-1, Procaspase-3 and XIAP) allows prognosticating PFS in stage III/IV melanoma patients. Following antibody validation, marker expression was determined by automated and manual scoring of immunohistochemically stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from treatment-naive metastatic melanoma biopsies. Interestingly and counter-intuitively, low expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak and Smac indicated better prognosis (log-rank p < 0.0001, p = 0.0301 and p = 0.0227 for automated and p = 0.0422, p = 0.0410 and p = 0.0073 for manual scoring). These findings were independently validated in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) metastatic melanoma cohort (TCGA-SKCM) at transcript level (log-rank p = 0.0004, p = 0.0104 and p = 0.0377). Taking expression heterogeneity between the markers in individual tumour samples into account allowed defining combinatorial Bax, Bak, Smac signatures that were associated with significantly increased PFS (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0028 at protein and transcript level, respectively). Furthermore, combined low expression of Bax, Bak and Smac allowed predicting prolonged PFS (> 12 months) on a case-by-case basis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) = 0.79). Taken together, our results therefore suggest that Bax, Bak and Smac jointly define a signature with potential clinical utility in chemotherapy-treated metastatic melanoma."
"Modern diagnostic methods (next-generation sequencing) are one of the current hopes with regard to a personalised medicine. By applying detailed genetic analysis, it is possible to not only improve the prediction of potential risks (as, e.g., concerning hereditary breast cancer) but also the precision of therapy by targeting it to a specific genetic variant. However, there is no international standard for creating, structuring and/or transferring the results of a genetic test report. This type of test report often contains large amounts of complex information, and a standardised and consistent structure would offer potential benefits to all. These include reduced expenditure of time (due to the elimination of information-conversion steps), improved safety (due to a reduction in the occurrence of transmission errors, misunderstanding or misinterpretation of content) and improved clinical information gathering (by the respective linkage to scientific data and literature). Especially in regard to secondary use, a standardised (electronic) format would improve the suitability of these data in retrospective studies and basic research. In this study, we analysed the format and content of 96 genetic testing reports (germline and somatic) from Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Based on these results, we summarised and discussed potentially critical data that were demonstrated to be reported inconsistently, and propose a baseline structure for reporting that would also ease future electronic conversion."
"Control of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) remains a major challenge in Burkina Faso. Surveillance of the burden due to MiP based on routinely collected data at a fine-scale level, followed by an appropriate analysis and interpretation, may be crucial for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of existing control measures. We described the spatio-temporal dynamics of MiP at the community-level and assessed health program effects, mainly community-based health promotion, results-based financing, and intermittent-preventive-treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). Community-aggregated monthly MiP cases were downloaded from Health Management Information System and combined with covariates from other sources. The MiP spatio-temporal pattern was decomposed into three components: overall spatial and temporal trends and space-time interaction. Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal Poisson models were used to fit the MiP incidence rate and assess health program effects. The overall annual incidence increased between 2015 and 2017. The findings reveal spatio-temporal heterogenicity throughout the year, which peaked during rainy season. From the model without covariates, 96 communities located mainly in the Cascades, South-West, Center-West, Center-East, and Eastern regions, exhibited significant relative-risk levels. The combined effect (significant reducing effect) of RBF, health promotion and IPTp-SP strategies was greatest in 17.7% (17/96) of high burden malaria communities. Despite intensification of control efforts, MiP remains high at the community-scale. The provided risk maps are useful tools for highlighting areas where interventions should be optimized, particularly in high-risk communities."
"Lung surfactants are used for reducing alveolar surface tension in preterm infants to ease breathing. Phospholipid films with surfactant proteins regulate the activity of alveolar macrophages and reduce inflammation. Aberrant skin wound healing is characterized by persistent inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate if lung surfactant can promote wound healing. Preclinical wound models, e.g. cell scratch assays and full-thickness excisional wounds in mice, and a randomized, phase I clinical trial in healthy human volunteers using a suction blister model were used to study the effect of the commercially available bovine lung surfactant on skin wound repair. Lung surfactant increased migration of keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent manner with no effect on fibroblasts. Significantly reduced expression levels were found for pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes in murine wounds. Because of these beneficial effects in preclinical experiments, a clinical phase I study was initiated to monitor safety and tolerability of surfactant when applied topically onto human wounds and normal skin. No adverse effects were observed. Subepidermal wounds healed significantly faster with surfactant compared to control. Our study provides lung surfactant as a strong candidate for innovative treatment of chronic skin wounds and as additive for treatment of burn wounds to reduce inflammation and prevent excessive scarring."
"This study evaluates the use of L-PRF as an autologous scaffold in nerve regeneration, and Schwann cells (SCs) proliferation and secretion of neurotrophic factors and its anti-inflammatory effect on SC Porphyromonas Gingivalis-Lipopolysaccharide (PG-LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in vitro. SEM was done to investigate various features of L-PRF. L-PRF-extracts was used to investigate the release of growth factors and treatment of SCs line. ELISA was applied to examine the release of IGF-1. The proliferative effect of L-PRF on SCs was assessed with CCK-8 assay. The effect of L-PRF on the mRNA and protein expression of SC neurotrophic factors were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA. CCK-8 assay and RT-qPCR were used to determine the required concentration and the action time of PG-LPS before the anti-inflammatory effect of L-PRF was determined by measuring the changes in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-a with RT-qPCR and ELISA. There are different features in L-PRF. Fourteen days was sufficient to release adequate GF. The mRNA expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines were notably raised by PG-LPS in 3-hours treatment. L-PRF can increase SC proliferation, neurotrophic factors secretion, and suppress SC PG-LPS-induced inflammatory responses in vitro. L-PRF has the potential as an autologous biological additive for peripheral nerve regeneration in the event of nerve inflammation and injuries."
"The founder variant DHCR7:c.964-1G>C causing autosomal recessive Smith–Lemli–Opitz (SLOS) was introduced into the Israeli preconception carrier program for Ashkenazi Jews in 2017 because of the high carrier frequency in this population (2.3%). Other disease-causing variants in DHCR7 are relatively rare in Israeli population. Discrepancy between the carrier frequency and disease prevalence raises the question of the actual risks for affected offspring for couples detected by the screening program. We performed a literature review of all relevant publications regarding homozygous DHCR7:c.964-1G>C fetuses/patients. We also collected clinical data about couples identified in the national screening program, including reproductive history. Out of 32 homozygous fetuses, six died in utero, 11 pregnancies were terminated during second trimester, and 15 children were born. All died between first days of life till 3 months of age. Reproductive history of SLOS-at-risk couples showed that after correction for ascertainment bias, out of 61 pregnancies, there was an absence of affected fetuses/children and an excess of miscarriages even if assumed that all the homozygous fetuses were miscarried. Out of these, eight families were Israelis, they had a total of one sick child, 21 healthy children, and 21 miscarriages. Our observations support the previous knowledge that homozygosity for c.964-1G>C in DHCR7 leads to a severe phenotype or early miscarriage. An unexpected observation was the excess of early miscarriages. This phenomenon is unclear and awaits further studies."
"NOTCH receptor signaling plays a pivotal role in liver homeostasis and hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the role of NOTCH pathway mutations and the NOTCH target gene HES5 in liver tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of 54 human HCC specimens and compared the prevalence of NOTCH pathway component mutations with the TCGA-LIHC cohort (N = 364). In addition, we functionally characterized the NOTCH target HES5 and the patient-derived HES5-R31G mutation in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model applying different oncogenic backgrounds, to dissect the role of HES5 in different tumor subgroups in vivo. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in 14 immediate NOTCH pathway genes affecting 24.1% and 16.8% of HCC patients in the two independent cohorts, respectively. Among these, the HES5-R31G mutation was predicted in silico to have high biological relevance. Functional analyses in cell culture showed that HES5 reduced cell migration and clonogenicity. Further analyses revealed that the patient-derived HES5-R31G mutant protein was non-functional due to loss of DNA binding and greatly reduced nuclear localization. Furthermore, HES5 exhibited a negative feedback loop by directly inhibiting the NOTCH target HES1 and downregulated the pro-proliferative MYC targets ODC1 and LDHA. Interestingly, HES5 inhibited MYC-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas it promoted AKT-dependent liver tumor formation and stem cell features in a murine model. Thus, NOTCH pathway component mutations are commonly observed in HCC. Furthermore, the NOTCH target gene HES5 has both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions in liver cancer proposing a driver gene dependency and it promotes tumorigenesis with its interaction partner AKT."
"In recent years complex networks have been identified as powerful mathematical frameworks for the adequate modeling of many applied problems in disparate research fields. Assuming a Master Equation (ME) modeling the exchange of information within the network, we set up a perturbative approach in order to investigate how node alterations impact on the network information flow. The main assumption of the perturbed ME (pME) model is that the simultaneous presence of multiple node alterations causes more or less intense network frailties depending on the specific features of the perturbation. In this perspective the collective behavior of a set of molecular alterations on a gene network is a particularly adapt scenario for a first application of the proposed method, since most diseases are neither related to a single mutation nor to an established set of molecular alterations. Therefore, after characterizing the method numerically, we applied as a proof of principle the pME approach to breast cancer (BC) somatic mutation data downloaded from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. For each patient we measured the network frailness of over 90 significant subnetworks of the protein-protein interaction network, where each perturbation was defined by patient-specific somatic mutations. Interestingly the frailness measures depend on the position of the alterations on the gene network more than on their amount, unlike most traditional enrichment scores. In particular low-degree mutations play an important role in causing high frailness measures. The potential applicability of the proposed method is wide and suggests future development in the control theory context."
"The association of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and death in the elderly is unknown. In the SWEETCO 65+ study we analyzed prospectively a Swiss Cohort of Elderly Patients with Venous Thromboembolism (SWITCO 65+). 888 patients were enrolled for the SWEETCO 65+ analysis. HbA1c was determined at baseline and divided into three categories (HbA1c < 5.7%, normal range; 5.7–6.49%, pre-diabetic range; and >6.5%, diabetic range). Median follow-up was 2.5 years. The primary endpoint was recurrent VTE. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and major bleeds. The total prevalence of diabetes was 22.1%. The risk of recurrent VTE was similar in patients with HbA1c with pre-diabetes (adjusted subhazard ratio (aSHR) 1.07 [0.70 to 1.63]) and diabetes (aSHR 0.73 [0.39 to 1.37]) as compared to those with a HbA1c in the normal range. However, a HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (median IQ range 7.0 [6.70;7.60]) was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.83 [1.21 to 2.75]). In summary we found no association between HbA1c and major bleeding. Elevated HbA1c levels are not associated with recurrent VTE but with increased all-cause mortality in an elderly population with acute VTE."
"Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) mimics liver cirrhosis in many aspects, and no efficient imaging method to differentiate the two diseases has been reported to date. In this study, the imaging and pathological characteristics were analysed for both IPH and cirrhosis. From January 2015 to March 2019, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and pathological results from 16 IPH and 16 liver cirrhosis patients, as well as imaging results of 16 normal patients as a control group, were retrospectively reviewed. The age of the patients was 39 ± 20 years. There was a significant difference in the mean lumen diameter, wall thickness and ratio of thickness to diameter between the IPH and liver cirrhosis patients in the main and sagittal portal veins (P < 0.05), as well as in the lumen diameter and ratio of thickness to diameter between the IPH and liver cirrhosis patients in the Segment 3 (S3) portal vein (P < 0.05). In IPH patients, the main imaging changes were portal vein wall thickening, stenosis or occlusion, a low enhancement area along the portal vein in the delay phase in contrast-enhanced imaging, and a non-homogeneous change in T1WI. The corresponding pathological changes included interlobular vein thickening, stenosis, occlusion, portal area fibrosis, and atrophy or apoptosis of hepatocytes. The main imaging characteristic of liver cirrhosis was a nodular change in T1WI, and the related pathological change was pseudolobule formation. The imaging characteristics of IPH include thickening of the portal vein vascular wall, stenosis of the portal vein lumen and the absence of diffuse cirrhosis-like nodules. These imaging features have a definite pathological basis and could help make differential diagnoses between IPH and cirrhosis."
"Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) permits the reconstruction of super-resolved microvascular images at clinically relevant penetration depths, which can be potentially leveraged to provide non-invasive quantitative measures of tissue hemodynamics and hypoxic status. We demonstrate that ULM microbubble data processing methods, applied to images acquired with a Verasonics Vantage 256 system, can provide a non-invasive imaging surrogate biomarker of tissue oxygenation status. This technique was applied to evaluate the microvascular structure, vascular perfusion, and hypoxia of a renal cell carcinoma xenograft model grown in the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. Histological microvascular density was significantly correlated to ULM measures of intervessel distance (R = −0.92, CI95 = [−0.99,−0.42], p = 0.01). The Distance Metric, a measure of vascular tortuosity, was found to be significantly correlated to hypoxyprobe quantifications (R = 0.86, CI95 = [0.17, 0.99], p = 0.03). ULM, by providing non-invasive in vivo microvascular structural information, has the potential to be a crucial clinical imaging modality for the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of solid tumors."
"Mechano-acoustic signals emanating from the heart and lungs contain valuable information about the cardiopulmonary system. Unobtrusive wearable sensors capable of monitoring these signals longitudinally can detect early pathological signatures and titrate care accordingly. Here, we present a wearable, hermetically-sealed high-precision vibration sensor that combines the characteristics of an accelerometer and a contact microphone to acquire wideband mechano-acoustic physiological signals, and enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple health factors associated with the cardiopulmonary system including heart and respiratory rate, heart sounds, lung sounds, and body motion and position of an individual. The encapsulated accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) utilizes nano-gap transducers to achieve extraordinary sensitivity in a wide bandwidth (DC-12 kHz) with high dynamic range. The sensors were used to obtain health factors of six control subjects with varying body mass index, and their feasibility in detection of weak mechano-acoustic signals such as pathological heart sounds and shallow breathing patterns is evaluated on patients with preexisting conditions."
"Critical-size bone defects, which require large-volume tissue reconstruction, remain a clinical challenge. Bone engineering has the potential to provide new treatment concepts, yet clinical translation requires anatomically and physiologically relevant preclinical models. The ovine critical-size long-bone defect model has been validated in numerous studies as a preclinical tool for evaluating both conventional and novel bone-engineering concepts. With sufficient training and experience in large-animal studies, it is a technically feasible procedure with a high level of reproducibility when appropriate preoperative and postoperative management protocols are followed. The model can be established by following a procedure that includes the following stages: (i) preoperative planning and preparation, (ii) the surgical approach, (iii) postoperative management, and (iv) postmortem analysis. Using this model, full results for peer-reviewed publication can be attained within 2 years. In this protocol, we comprehensively describe how to establish proficiency using the preclinical model for the evaluation of a range of bone defect reconstruction options."
"Germline mutations in PTEN account for ~10% of cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with coincident macrocephaly. To explore the importance of nuclear PTEN in the development of ASD and macrocephaly, we previously generated a mouse model with predominantly cytoplasmic localization of Pten (Ptenm3m4/m3m4).Cytoplasmic predominant Pten localization results in a phenotype of extreme macrocephaly and autistic-like traits. Transcriptomic analysis of the Ptenm3m4/m3m4 cortex found upregulated gene pathways related to myeloid cell activation, myeloid cell migration, and phagocytosis. These transcriptomic findings were used to direct in vitro assays on Pten wild-type and Ptenm3m4/m3m4 microglia. We found increased Iba1 and C1q expression with enhanced phagocytic capacity in Ptenm3m4/m3m4 microglia, indicating microglial activation. Moreover, through a series of neuron-microglia co-culture experiments, we found Ptenm3m4/m3m4 microglia are more efficient at synaptic pruning compared with wild-type controls. In addition, we found evidence for neuron-microglia cross-talk, where Ptenm3m4/m3m4 neurons elicit enhanced pruning from innately activated microglia. Subsequent in vivo studies validated our in vitro findings. We observed a concurrent decline in the expression of Pten and synaptic markers in the Ptenm3m4/m3m4 cortex. At ~3 weeks of age, with a 50% drop in Pten expression compared with wild-type levels, we observed enhanced activation of microglia in the Ptenm3m4/m3m4 brain. Collectively, our data provide evidence that dysregulated Pten in microglia has an etiological role in microglial activation, phagocytosis, and synaptic pruning, creating avenues for future studies on the importance of PTEN in maintaining microglia homeostasis."
"Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a major complication of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and a leading cause for hospital admissions and death. We aimed to study the spectrum of clinical and laboratory features of ACS and to assess the predisposing factors and predictors of severity. A retrospective case-control cohort was studied by retrieving patient information from electronic medical records after ethical approval. One hundred adolescents and adults with SCA and hospital admissions for ACS were identified through the discharge summaries, along with 20 additional patients presenting with VOC, but without ACS (controls). Among the patients with ACS, fever (>38.5 °C), reduced oxygen saturation (<95) and asplenia significantly differed when compared to those of controls (p < 0.05, chi-squared test). The degree of severity was reflected in the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), simple and exchange transfusions, and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and multi-lobar atelectasis/consolidation, which were significantly higher in the cases with ACS than in the controls. Lower haemoglobin (Hb) and high WBC counts were also significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05, Student’s t test). Using logistic regression, our study further demonstrated that asplenia, fever, and reduced O2 saturation, along with low Hb and leukocytosis, were important predictors for the development of ACS."
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is among the most aggressive forms of breast cancer with limited therapeutic options. TAK1 is implicated in aggressive behavior of TNBC, while means are not fully understood. Here, we report that pharmacological blockade of TAK1 signaling hampered ribosome biogenesis (RBG) by reducing expression of RBG regulators such as RRS1, while not changing expression of ribosomal core proteins. Notably, TAK1 blockade upregulated expression of p53 target genes in cell lines carrying wild type (wt) TP53 but not in p53-mutant cells, suggesting involvement of ribosomal stress in the response. Accordingly, p53 activation by blockade of TAK1 was prevented by depletion of ribosomal protein RPL11. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of TAK1 or RELA resulted in RPL11-dependent activation of p53 signaling. Knockdown of RRS1 was sufficient to disrupt nucleolar structures and resulted in activation of p53. TCGA data showed that TNBCs express high levels of RBG regulators, and elevated RRS1 levels correlate with unfavorable prognosis. Cytotoxicity data showed that TNBC cell lines are more sensitive to TAK1 inhibitor compared to luminal and HER2+ cell lines. These results show that TAK1 regulates p53 activation by controlling RBG factors, and the TAK1-ribosome axis is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC."
"Recently, super-enhancers (SEs) have been identified as a unique type of transcriptional regulation involved in cancer development. SEs exhibit a size, high transcription factor density, and strong binding to the transcriptional machinery compared with typical enhancers. SEs play an essential role in cell growth, differentiation, and disease initiation and progression including tumorigenesis. In particular, cancer-specific SEs have been proven to be key oncogenic drivers types of tumor cells. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that cancer-specific SEs can mediate the dysregulation of signaling pathways and promote cancer cell growth. Additionally, therapeutic strategies directly targeting SE components, for example, by disrupting SE structure or inhibiting SE cofactors, have shown a good curative effect on various cancers."
"Human is subjected from his surrounding to various hepatotoxins, which aggravates his liver. Nowadays, natural polyphenols have attracted great interest in health improvement, especially liver health. The present research, therefore, assessed the hepatotherapeutic potency of the isolated polyphenols (VVF1) from seedless (pulp and skin) black Vitis vinifera (VV) against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Further, VVF1 was fractionated into resveratrol-enriched (VVF2) and phenolics-enriched (VVF3) fractions to study (in vitro) the possible synergism of their coexistence. The highest content of phenolics in VVF1 displayed in vitro synergistic antioxidant and anti-hepatotoxic activities comparing to VVF2, VVF3, and silymarin (SM, reference drug). More importantly, it exhibited multiple in vivo regulatory functions via diminishing oxidative stress and inflammation, which in turn decreased necroptosis and pro-fibrotic mediators (mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1). In addition to these novel findings, VVF1 had higher anti-hepatotoxic potency than that of SM in most of the studied parameters. The histopathological analysis confirmed the improving role of VVF1 in the serious hepatic damage induced by CCl4. Thus, the synergistic functions of VVF1 polyphenols could be a promising new anti-hepatotoxic agent for targeting both necroptotic and profibrotic mediators."
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a devastating condition that is reaching epidemic levels owing to the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity, as well as ageing of the population. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, CKD is slowly progressive and leads to irreversible nephron loss, end-stage renal disease and/or premature death. Factors that contribute to CKD progression include parenchymal cell loss, chronic inflammation, fibrosis and reduced regenerative capacity of the kidney. Current therapies have limited effectiveness and only delay disease progression, underscoring the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to either stop or reverse progression. Preclinical studies have identified several approaches that reduce fibrosis in experimental models, including targeting cytokines, transcription factors, developmental and signalling pathways and epigenetic modulators, particularly microRNAs. Some of these nephroprotective strategies are now being tested in clinical trials. Lessons learned from the failure of clinical studies of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) blockade underscore the need for alternative approaches to CKD therapy, as strategies that target a single pathogenic process may result in unexpected negative effects on simultaneously occurring processes. Additional promising avenues include preventing tubular cell injury and anti-fibrotic therapies that target activated myofibroblasts, the main collagen-producing cells."
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer unresponsive to traditional receptor-targeted treatments, leading to a disproportionate number of deaths. Invasive breast cancer is believed to evolve from non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Detection of triple-negative DCIS (TN-DCIS) is challenging, therefore strategies to study molecular events governing progression of pre-invasive TN-DCIS to invasive TNBC are needed. Here, we study a canine TN-DCIS progression and investigate the DNA methylation landscape of normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), DCIS and invasive breast cancer. We report hypo- and hypermethylation of genes within functional categories related to cancer such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell migration. DNA methylation changes associated with cancer-related genes become more pronounced at invasive breast cancer stage. Importantly, we identify invasive-only and DCIS-specific DNA methylation alterations that could potentially determine which lesions progress to invasive cancer and which could remain as pre-invasive DCIS. Changes in DNA methylation during TN-DCIS progression in this canine model correspond with gene expression patterns in human breast tissues. This study provides evidence for utilizing methylation status of gene candidates to define late-stage (DCIS and invasive), invasive stage only or DCIS stage only of TN-DCIS progression."
"ObjectiveTo study the association between perinatal sentinel events (PSE) and brain MRI/neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH).DesignThis is a retrospective single-center study. Data collection included perinatal history, brain MRI, and neurodevelopmental outcome.ResultsOut of the 182 neonates, 53 (29%) neonates had PSE and 129 (71%) neonates did not have PSE. Neonates with PSE had more normal MRIs (76%) compared with neonates without PSE (55%), p = 0.01. PSE was associated with favorable motor (p = 0.02), language outcome (p = 0.03), and trend to better cognitive scores (p = 0.13). In PSE, favorable motor outcome persisted (OR for impairment 0.15 (0.003–0.84), p = 0.03) after adjusting for the degree of encephalopathy and brain MRI injury. Injury on brain MRI despite TH after PSE was associated with unfavorable neurodevelopmental outcome (p < 0.001).ConclusionNeonates with HIE receiving TH after PSE had less severe injury on brain MRI after rewarming, and improved motor and language outcomes at 18–36 months."
"Lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) is a lysophospholipid, its generating enzyme, phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1), reportedly plays roles in stomach and colon cancers. Here, we examined the potential roles of LysoPS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ninety-seven HCC patients who underwent surgical treatment were enrolled in this study and approved by the institutional review board. Among LysoPS-related enzymes and receptors, increased PS-PLA1 or LysoPS receptor 1 (LPS1) mRNA was observed in HCC tissues compared to non-HCC tissues. PS-PLA1 mRNA in HCC was associated with no clinical parameters, while LPS1 mRNA in HCC was correlated inversely with tumor differentiation. Furthermore, higher serum PS-PLA1 was observed in HCC patients compared to healthy control and correlated with PS-PLA1 mRNA in non-HCC tissues and with serum AST or ALT. Additionally, serum levels of PS-PLA1 were higher in HCC patients with HCV-related liver injury than in those with HBV or non-HBV-, non-HCV-related liver diseases. In conclusion, among LysoPS-related enzymes and receptors, PS-PLA1 and LPS1 mRNA were increased in HCC. Based on the correlation between the serum PS-PLA1 and the mRNA level of PS-PLA1 in non-HCC tissues, the liver may be the main source of serum PS-PLA1, and serum PS-PLA1 levels may be a useful marker for liver injury."
"Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in many diseases. A recent study revealed that aerobic glycolysis in lung tissue is closely related to pulmonary fibrosis, and also occurs during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. However, whether LPS induces aerobic glycolysis in lung fibroblasts remains unknown. The present study demonstrated that LPS promotes collagen synthesis in the lung fibroblasts through aerobic glycolysis via the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR/PFKFB3 pathway. Challenging the human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line with LPS activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, significantly upregulated the expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), enhanced the aerobic glycolysis, and promoted collagen synthesis. These phenomena could be reversed by the PI3K-Akt inhibitor LY294002, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, PFKFB3 inhibitor 3PO, or PFKFB3 silencing by specific shRNA, or aerobic glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG. In addition, PFKFB3 expression and aerobic glycolysis were also detected in the mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which could be reversed by the intraperitoneal injection of PFKFB3 inhibitor 3PO. Taken together, this study revealed that in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, LPS might mediate lung fibroblast aerobic glycolysis through the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR/PFKFB3 pathway."
"Aging is associated with declines in physical and cognitive performance. While there is no doubt about beneficial effects of physical exercise on proxies of strength and balance, the overall evidence for positive effects of resistance and balance training on executive functions is rather inconsistent. Whether the simultaneous exercising of strength and balance, i.e., instability resistance training, promotes executive functions in older adults is unknown. In the present trial, we tested the effects of unstable vs. stable resistance training on executive functions. Sixty-eight healthy older adults aged 65–79 years were randomly assigned to either an instability free-weight resistance training or one of two stable machine-based resistance training programs. Each group exercised twice a week on non-consecutive days for 10 weeks. Four tests to evaluate specific domains of executive functions were administered prior and following training: working memory, processing speed, response inhibition and set-shifting. The instability resistance training group improved working memory, processing speed and response inhibition from pre to post-test. In contrast, we found no improvements in executive functions for both stable resistance training groups. Our results demonstrate that 10 weeks of instability resistance training suffice to improve executive functions in older adults."
"Tears contain pheromones that trigger specific behavioral responses. In the mouse, male tear fluid is involved in long and short-term effects such as the receptive behavior and pregnancy block in females and the aggression in males. In contrast, pup tears exert an inhibitory effect on male mating behavior, also promoting sexual rejection in females. In the rat, a male lacrimal protein acts as an intraspecific and heterospecific signal enhancing sexual behavior in females and evoking avoidance behavior in mouse. However, behavioral effects of female tears on male behavior have yet to be described. Here, we report that female lacrimal fluid of different mouse strains contains a relatively small and involatile factor that abolishes inter-male aggression switching it into a copulatory behavior. The production of this molecule by the lacrimal glands is not affected by the estrous cycle but it is sensitive to ovariectomy, thus suggesting a control mediated by hormones. Moreover, this lacrimal anti-aggression pheromone modulates the activity of the lateral habenula, a brain area responsible for the valence of the aggressive interactions."
"The lysis of red blood cells was shown to occur in human ruptured atherosclerotic lesions and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of the brain. Liberated cell-free hemoglobin was found to undergo oxidation in both pathologies. We hypothesize that hemoglobin-derived peptides are generated during hemoglobin oxidation both in complicated atherosclerotic lesions and IVH of the brain, triggering endothelial cell dysfunction. Oxidized hemoglobin and its products were followed with spectrophotometry, LC–MS/MS analysis and detection of the cross-linking of globin chains in complicated atherosclerotic lesions of the human carotid artery and the hemorrhaged cerebrospinal liquid of preterm infants. The vascular pathophysiologic role of oxidized hemoglobin and the resultant peptides was assessed by measuring endothelial integrity, the activation of endothelial cells and the induction of proinflammatory genes. Peptide fragments of hemoglobin (VNVDEVGGEALGRLLVVYPWTQR, LLVVYPWTQR, MFLSFPTTK, VGAHAGEYGAELERMFLSFPTTK, and FLASVSTVLTSKYR) were identified in ruptured atherosclerotic lesions and in IVH of the human brain. Fragments resulting from the oxidation of hemoglobin were accompanied by the accumulation of ferryl hemoglobin. Similar to complicated atherosclerotic lesions of the human carotid artery, a high level of oxidized and cross-linked hemoglobin was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid after IVH. Haptoglobin inhibited hemoglobin fragmentation provoked by peroxide. The resultant peptides failed to bind haptoglobin or albumin. Peptides derived from hemoglobin oxidation and ferryl hemoglobin induced intercellular gap formation, decreased junctional resistance in the endothelium, and enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Enhanced expression of TNF and the activation of NLRP3 and CASP1 followed by the increased generation of IL-1β and nuclear translocation of the NF-κβ transcription factor occurred in response to hemoglobin-derived peptides, and ferryl hemoglobin in endothelium was upregulated in both pathologies. We conclude that the oxidation of hemoglobin in complicated atherosclerotic lesions and intraventricular hemorrhage of the brain generates peptide fragments and ferryl hemoglobin with the potential to trigger endothelial cell dysfunction."
"Multimorbidity has great impact on health care. We constructed multimorbidity networks in the general population, extracted subnets focused on common chronic conditions and analysed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) comorbidity network. We used electronic records from 3,135,948 adult people in Catalonia, Spain (539,909 with T2DM), with at least 2 coexistent chronic conditions within the study period (2006–2017). We constructed networks from odds-ratio estimates adjusted by age and sex and considered connections with OR > 1.2 and p-value < 1e-5. Directed networks and trajectories were derived from temporal associations. Interactive networks are freely available in a website with the option to customize characteristics and subnets. The more connected conditions in T2DM undirected network were: complicated hypertension and atherosclerosis/peripheral vascular disease (degree: 32), cholecystitis/cholelithiasis, retinopathy and peripheral neuritis/neuropathy (degree: 31). T2DM has moderate number of connections and centrality but is associated with conditions with high scores in the multimorbidity network (neuropathy, anaemia and digestive diseases), and severe conditions with poor prognosis. The strongest associations from T2DM directed networks were to retinopathy (OR: 23.8), glomerulonephritis/nephrosis (OR: 3.4), peripheral neuritis/neuropathy (OR: 2.7) and pancreas cancer (OR: 2.4). Temporal associations showed the relevance of retinopathy in the progression to complicated hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and organ failure."
"Deficits in social cognition have been proposed as a marker of schizophrenia. Growing evidence suggests especially hyperfunctioning of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to neutral social stimuli reflecting the neural correlates of social-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. We characterized healthy participants according to schizotypy (n = 74) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in ZNF804A (n = 73), as they represent risk variants for schizophrenia from the perspectives of personality traits and genetics, respectively. A social-cognitive fMRI task was applied to investigate the association of right pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral face stimuli with schizotypy and rs1344706. Higher right pSTS activation in response to neutral facial expressions was found in individuals with increased positive (trend) and disorganization symptoms, as well as in carriers of the risk allele of rs1344706. In addition, a positive association between right–left pSTS connectivity and disorganization symptoms during neutral face processing was revealed. Although these findings warrant replication, we suggest that right pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral facial expressions presents an endophenotype of schizophrenia. We assume that right pSTS hyperfunctioning is a vulnerability to perceive neutral social stimuli as emotionally or intentionally salient, probably contributing to the emergence of symptoms of schizophrenia."
"Cardiac pathologies associated with arrhythmic activity are often accompanied by inflammation. The contribution of inflammatory cells to the electrophysiological properties of injured myocardium is unknown. Myocardial scar cell types and intercellular contacts were analyzed using a three-dimensional reconstruction from serial blockface scanning electron microscopy data. Three distinct cell populations were identified: inflammatory, fibroblastic and endocardial cells. While individual fibroblastic cells interface with a greater number of cells, inflammatory cells have the largest contact area suggesting a role in establishing intercellular electrical connections in scar tissue. Optical mapping was used to study the electrophysiological properties of scars in fetal liver chimeric mice generated using connexin43 knockout donors (bmpKO). Voltage changes were elicited in response to applied current pulses. Isopotential maps showed a steeper pattern of decay with distance from the electrode in scars compared with uninjured regions, suggesting reduced electrical coupling. The tissue decay constant, defined as the distance voltage reaches 37% of the amplitude at the edge of the scar, was 0.48 ± 0.04 mm (n = 11) in the scar of the bmpCTL group and decreased 37.5% in the bmpKO group (n = 10). Together these data demonstrate inflammatory cells significantly contribute to scar electrophysiology through coupling mediated at least partially by connexin43 expression."
"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), predominantly occurs among infants and children. Previous studies have shown that suitable, stable temperatures favor HFMD virus reproduction; however, temperature fluctuations also affect virus transmission, and there are, so far, no studies concerning the association between such fluctuations and the incidence of HFMD. The objective of this study was to map the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD incidence and quantify the long-term effects of temperature fluctuations on HFMD incidence in children. HFMD cases in children under five, from January 2009 to December 2013, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces of China, were used in this study. The GeoDetector and Bayesian space-time hierarchy models were employed to explore the spatial-temporal association between temperature fluctuations and HFMD incidence. The results indicate that HFMD incidence had significant spatial stratified heterogeneity (GeoDetector q-statistic = 0.83, p < 0.05), and that areas with higher risk mainly appeared in metropolises and their adjacent regions. HFMD transmission was negatively associated with temperature fluctuations. A 1 °C increase in the standard deviation of maximum and minimum temperatures was associated with decreases of 8.22% and 11.87% in the risk of HFMD incidence, respectively. The study suggests that large temperature fluctuations affect virus growth or multiplication, thereby inhibiting the activity of the virus and potentially even leading to its extinction, and consequently affecting the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD. The findings can serve as a reference for the practical control of this disease and offer help in the rational allocation of medical resources."
"Identifying novel drug–protein interactions is crucial for drug discovery. For this purpose, many machine learning-based methods have been developed based on drug descriptors and one-dimensional protein sequences. However, protein sequences cannot accurately reflect the interactions in three-dimensional space. However, direct input of three-dimensional structure is of low efficiency due to the sparse three-dimensional matrix, and is also prevented by the limited number of co-crystal structures available for training. Here we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework to predict the interactions by representing proteins with a two-dimensional distance map from monomer structures (Image) and drugs with molecular linear notation (String), following the visual question answering mode. For efficient training of the system, we introduce a dynamic attentive convolutional neural network to learn fixed-size representations from the variable-length distance maps and a self-attentional sequential model to automatically extract semantic features from the linear notations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on the directory of useful decoys, enhanced (DUD-E), human and BindingDB benchmark datasets. Further attention visualization provides biological interpretation to depict highlighted regions of both protein and drug molecules."
"Respondent Driven Sampling study (RDS) is a population sampling method developed to study hard-to-reach populations. A sample is obtained by chain-referral recruitment in a network of contacts within the population of interest. Such self-selected samples are not representative of the target population and require weighing observations to reduce estimation bias. Recently, the Network Model-Assisted (NMA) method was described to compute the required weights. The NMA method relies on modeling the underlying contact network in the population where the RDS was conducted, in agreement with directly observable characteristics of the sample such as the number of contacts, but also with more difficult-to-measure characteristics such as homophily or differential characteristics according to the response variable. Here we investigated the use of the NMA method to estimate HIV prevalence from RDS data when information on homophily is limited. We show that an iterative procedure based on the NMA approach allows unbiased estimations even in the case of strong population homophily and differential activity and limits bias in case of preferential recruitment. We applied the methods to determine HIV prevalence in men having sex with men in Brazilian cities and confirmed a high prevalence of HIV in these populations from 3.8% to 22.1%."
"Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the major treatment modality for human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs eventually relapse after treatment and the average survival of GBM patients is less than two years. There is some evidence that cannabidiol (CBD) can induce cell death and increases the radiosensitivity of GBM by enhancing apoptosis. Beside initiation of death, CBD has been demonstrated as an inducer of autophagy. In the present study, we address the question whether CBD simultaneously induces a protective effect in GBM by upregulating autophagy. Addition of chloroquine that suppressed autophagic flux to 2D GBM cultures increased CBD-induced cell death, presenting proof for the protective autophagy. Blockage of autophagy upregulated radiation-induced cytotoxicity but only modestly affected the levels of cell death in CBD- or CBD/γ-irradiated 3D GBM cultures. Furthermore, CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby changing a balance between cell death and survival. Suppression of JNK activation partially reduced CBD-induced cell death in 3D GBM cultures. In contrast, co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of PI3K-AKT-NF-κB, IKK-NF-κB or JAK2-STAT3 pathways killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures, potentially improving the therapeutic ratio of GBM."
"The permeation of small-molecule drugs across a phospholipid membrane bears much interest both in the pharmaceutical sciences and in physical chemistry. Connecting the chemistry of the drug and the lipids to the resulting thermodynamic properties remains of immediate importance. Here we report molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories using the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field. A wide, representative coverage of chemistry is provided: across solutes—exhaustively enumerating all 105 CG dimers—and across six phospholipids. For each combination, umbrella-sampling simulations provide detailed structural information of the solute at all depths from the bilayer midplane to bulk water, allowing a precise reconstruction of the potential of mean force. Overall, the present database contains trajectories from 15,120 MD simulations. This database may serve the further identification of structure-property relationships between compound chemistry and drug permeability."
"The maximal rate of heart rate (HR) increase (rHRI), a marker of HR acceleration during transition from rest to submaximal exercise, correlates with exercise performance. In this cohort study, whether rHRI tracked performance better when evaluated over shorter time-periods which include a greater proportion of HR acceleration and less steady-state HR was evaluated. rHRI and five-km treadmill running time-trial performance (5TTT) were assessed in 15 runners following one week of light training (LT), two weeks of heavy training (HT) and 10-day taper (T). rHRI was the first derivative maximum of a sigmoidal curve fit to one, two, three and four minutes of R-R data during transition from rest to running at 8 km/h (rHRI8 km/h), 10.5 km/h, 13 km/h and transition from 8 to 13 km/h (rHRI8–13km/h). 5TTT time increased from LT to HT (effect size [ES] 1.0, p < 0.001) then decreased from HT to T (ES −1.7, p < 0.001). 5TTT time was inversely related to rHRI8 km/h assessed over two (B = −5.54, p = 0.04) three (B = −5.34, p = 0.04) and four (B = −5.37, p = 0.04) minutes, and rHRI8–13km/h over one (B = −11.62, p = 0.006) and three (B = −11.44, p = 0.03) minutes. 5TTT correlated most consistently with rHRI8 km/h. rHRI8 km/h assessed over two to four minutes may be suitable for evaluating athlete responses to training."
"Study designCross-sectional.ObjectivesTo examine the associations between activities, body structures and functions, and their relationship with aetiology, age and sex in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) at discharge from first rehabilitation.SettingSwiss SCI Cohort Study (SwiSCI).MethodsThe study included 390 participants with newly acquired SCI and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as conceptual frame of reference. Body structures were represented by injury level and severity; body functions by cardiovascular, pulmonary, skin, bowel and urinary functions and pain; mental functions by anxiety, depression, optimism and self-esteem; and activities by independence in performing activities of daily living (ADL). Using structural equation modelling (SEM), indirect effects of body structures and functions on independence in performing ADL through mental functions were tested for each mental function separately. For each structural model, fit was assessed using several indices and differences in aetiology, age and sex groups were explored.ResultsThe structural model about optimism showed good fit in all indices; the models about anxiety, depression and self-esteem showed conflicting fit indices, respectively. Within all models, effects on independence in performing ADL were mainly direct. Pain showed significant (P < 0.05) indirect effects on independence in performing ADL within the depression, optimism and self-esteem models. The model about anxiety showed differences in aetiology groups.ConclusionsUsing an ICF-based modelling approach, this study presents an attempt towards a more comprehensive understanding of functioning in first rehabilitation of persons with SCI, which might be fundamental for rehabilitation planning."
"Osteocytes are mechanosensitive bone cells, but little is known about their effects on tumor cells in response to mechanical stimulation. We treated breast cancer cells with osteocyte-derived conditioned medium (CM) and fluid flow-treated conditioned medium (FFCM) with 0.25 Pa and 1 Pa shear stress. Notably, CM and FFCM at 0.25 Pa induced the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), but FFCM at 1 Pa induced the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This suggested that the effects of fluid flow on conditioned media depend on flow intensity. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based evaluation of Src activity and vinculin molecular force showed that osteopontin was involved in EMT and MET switching. A mouse model of tumor-induced osteolysis was tested using dynamic tibia loadings of 1, 2, and 5 N. The low 1 N loading suppressed tumor-induced osteolysis, but this beneficial effect was lost and reversed with loads at 2 and 5 N, respectively. Changing the loading intensities in vivo also led to changes in serum TGFβ levels and the composition of tumor-associated volatile organic compounds in the urine. Collectively, this study demonstrated the critical role of intensity-dependent mechanotransduction and osteopontin in tumor-osteocyte communication, indicating that a biophysical factor can tangibly alter the behaviors of tumor cells in the bone microenvironment."
"Nepal’s dual burden of undernutrition and over nutrition warrants further exploration of the population level differences in nutritional status. The study aimed to explore, for the first time in Nepal, potential geographic and socioeconomic variation in underweight and overweight and/or obesity prevalence in the country, adjusted for cluster and sample weight. Data came from 14,937 participants, including 6,172 men and 8,765 women, 15 years or older who participated in the 2016 Nepal Demography and Health Survey (NDHS). Single-level and multilevel multi-nominal logistic regression models and Lorenz curves were used to explore the inequalities in weight status. Urban residents had higher odds of being overweight and/or obese (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.62–2.20) and lower odds of being underweight (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.93) than rural residents. Participants from Provinces 2, and 7 were less likely to be overweight/obese and more likely to be underweight (referent: province-1). Participants from higher wealth quintile households were associated with higher odds of being overweight and/or obese (P-trend < 0.001) and lower odds of being underweight (P-trend < 0.001). Urban females at the highest wealth quintile were more vulnerable to overweight and/or obesity as 49% of them were overweight and/or obese and nearly 39% at the lowest wealth quintile were underweight."
"There are an increasing number of people who have had refractive surgery now developing cataract. To compare the accuracy of different intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas after laser refractive surgery (photorefractive keratectomy or laser in situ keratomileusis), a comprehensive literature search of PubMed and EMBASE was conducted to identify comparative cohort studies and case series comparing different formulas: Haigis-L, Shammas-PL, SRK/T, Holladay 1 and Hoffer Q. Seven cohort studies and three observational studies including 260 eyes were identified. There were significant differences when Hoffer Q formula compared with SRK/T, Holladay 1. Holladay 1 formula produced less prediction error than SRK/T formula in double-K method. Hoffer Q formula performed best among SRK/T and Holladay 1 formulas in total and single-K method. In eyes with previous data, it is recommended to choose double-K formula except SRK/T formula. In eyes with no previous data, Haigis-L formula is recommended if available, if the fourth formula is unavailable, single-k Hoffer Q is a good choice."
"Most small molecule drugs act on living systems by physically interacting with specific proteins and modulating target function. Identification of drug binding targets, within the complex milieu of the human proteome, remains a challenging task of paramount importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches for target identification employ complex workflows with limited throughput. Here, we present the isothermal shift assay (iTSA), a mass spectrometry method for proteome-wide identification of drug targets within lysates or living cells. Compared with prevailing methods, iTSA uses a simplified experimental design with increased statistical power to detect thermal stability shifts that are induced by small molecule binding. Using a pan-kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, we demonstrate improved performance over commonly used thermal proteome profiling methods, identifying known targets in cell lysates and living cells. We also demonstrate the identification of both known targets and additional candidate targets for the kinase inhibitor harmine in cell and tissue lysates."
"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition whereby individuals present with sensorimotor symptoms incompatible with other neurological disorders. Early-life maltreatment (ELM) is a risk factor for developing FND, yet few studies have investigated brain network–trauma relationships in this population. In this neuroimaging–gene expression study, we used two graph theory approaches to elucidate ELM subtype effects on resting-state functional connectivity architecture in 30 patients with motor FND. Twenty-one individuals with comparable depression, anxiety, and ELM scores were used as psychiatric controls. Thereafter, we compared trauma endophenotypes in FND with regional differences in transcriptional gene expression as measured by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). In FND patients only, we found that early-life physical abuse severity, and to a lesser extent physical neglect, correlated with corticolimbic weighted-degree functional connectivity. Connectivity profiles influenced by physical abuse occurred in limbic (amygdalar–hippocampal), paralimbic (cingulo-insular and ventromedial prefrontal), and cognitive control (ventrolateral prefrontal) areas, as well as in sensorimotor and visual cortices. These findings held adjusting for individual differences in depression/anxiety, PTSD, and motor phenotypes. In FND, physical abuse also correlated with amygdala and insula coupling to motor cortices. In exploratory analyses, physical abuse correlated connectivity maps overlapped with the AHBA spatial expression of three gene clusters: (i) neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission genes in limbic/paralimbic areas; (ii) locomotory behavior and neuronal generation genes in left-lateralized structures; and (iii) nervous system development and cell motility genes in right-lateralized structures. These circuit-specific architectural profiles related to individual differences in childhood physical abuse burden advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of FND."
"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen (O-Ag) is known to limit antibody binding to surface antigens, although the relationship between antibody, O-Ag and other outer-membrane antigens is poorly understood. Here we report, immunization with the trimeric porin OmpD from Salmonella Typhimurium (STmOmpD) protects against infection. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations indicate this is because OmpD trimers generate footprints within the O-Ag layer sufficiently sized for a single IgG Fab to access. While STmOmpD differs from its orthologue in S. Enteritidis (SEn) by a single amino-acid residue, immunization with STmOmpD confers minimal protection to SEn. This is due to the OmpD-O-Ag interplay restricting IgG binding, with the pairing of OmpD with its native O-Ag being essential for optimal protection after immunization. Thus, both the chemical and physical structure of O-Ag are key for the presentation of specific epitopes within proteinaceous surface-antigens. This enhances combinatorial antigenic diversity in Gram-negative bacteria, while reducing associated fitness costs."
"A precise imaging technique to evaluate osteogenesis, osteodifferentiation, and osseointegration following peri-implant surgery is in high clinical demand. Herein, we report the generation of two new, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for use in the molecular imaging of bone repair. The first probe aims to monitor the in vitro differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts. A NIR fluorochrome was conjugated to a cyclic peptide that binds to integrin α5β1, a factor that promotes osteogenesis in MSCs and therefore functioned as an osteoblast-specific marker. The second probe aims to monitor osteogenesis, and was generated by conjugating the drug pamidronate to a NIR fluorescent gold nanocluster. Pamidronate specifically binds to hydroxyapatite (HA), a mineral present in bone that is produced by osteoblasts, and therefore provides a functional marker for new bone formation. Our results show that both probes bind to their specific targets in vitro-differentiated osteoblasts, and not to undifferentiated MSCs, and emit NIR fluorescence for functional detection. This in vitro work demonstrates the ability of these probes to bind to active osteoblasts and their mineral deposits and highlight their potential utility as clinical tools for the imaging of the osseointegration process at the molecular level."
"Accessibility of evidence-based behavioral health interventions is one of the main challenges in health care and effective treatment approaches are not always available for patients that would benefit from them. Digitization has dramatically changed the health care landscape. Although mHealth has shown promise in addressing issues of accessibility and reach, there is vast room for improvements. The integration of technical innovations and theory driven development is a key concern. Digital solutions developed by industry alone often lack a clear theoretical framework and the solutions are not properly evaluated to meet the standards of scientifically proven efficacy. On the other hand, mHealth interventions developed in academia may be theory driven but lack user friendliness and are commonly technically outdated by the time they are implemented in regular care, if they ever are. In an ongoing project aimed at scientific innovation, the mHealth Agile Development and Evaluation Lifecycle was used to combine strengths from both industry and academia in the development of ACTsmart – a smartphone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy treatment for adult chronic pain patients. The present study describes the early development of ACTsmart, in the process of moving the product from alpha testing to a clinical trial ready solution."
"Despite the widespread clinical use of cardioprotection by long-term direct antagonism of P2Y12 receptor, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify how release of pro-survival exosomes from human cardiac-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (hCPCs) is regulated by clinically relevant dose of ticagrelor (1 μM), an oral selective and reversible non-thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor. Ticagrelor-induced enhancement of exosome levels is related to increased mitotic activity of hCPCs. We show a drug-response threshold above which the effects on hCPCs are lost due to higher dose of ticagrelor and larger adenosine levels. While it is known that pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor halts cell proliferation through dephosphorylation of histone H3 residue Ser10, we demonstrate that it also prevents ticagrelor-induced effects on release of cardiac progenitor cell-derived exosomes delivering anti-apoptotic HSP70. Indeed, sustained pre-treatment of cardiomyocytes with exosomes released from explant-derived hCPCs exposed to low-dose ticagrelor attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis through acute phosphorylation of ERK42/44. Our data indicate that ticagrelor can be leveraged to modulate release of anti-hypoxic exosomes from resident hCPCs."
"To define the relationship between the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) and SMN2, and explore the variability of these two genes within the generations, SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers were determined for 227 SMA families. The association analysis indicated that there was a negative correlation between the copy number of SMN1 and SMN2 (Spearman = −0.472, P < 0.001) in 227 SMA children and 454 of their parents. The average SMN copies from father and mother in each SMA family were used to represent the copy number in the parent’s generation. Subsequently, SMN transmission analysis showed that the similar distribution trend of SMN1 and SMN2 copy number was not only in the SMA children and their parents’ generation but also in the non-SMA families. Moreover, when the SMN2 copy number was one in the parent’s generation, 75% of their SMA children had type I and 25% of them had type II/III. However, when the SMN2 copies were three in the parent’s generation, all of their SMA children were type II/III. Therefore, the diversity of SMN copies was mostly inherited and the SMN2 copy number in the parent’s generation could predict the disease severity of SMA children to some extent."
"TAFRO syndrome, a clinical subtype of idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), consists of a constellation of symptoms/signs including thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction, and organomegaly. The etiology of iMCD-TAFRO and the basis for cytokine hypersecretion commonly seen in iMCD-TAFRO patients has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a somatic MEK2P128L mutation and a germline RUNX1G60C mutation in two patients with iMCD-TAFRO, respectively. The MEK2P128L mutation, which has been identified previously in solid tumor and histiocytosis patients, caused hyperactivated MAP kinase signaling, conferred IL-3 hypersensitivity and sensitized the cells to various MEK inhibitors. The RUNX1G60C mutation abolished the transcriptional activity of wild-type RUNX1 and functioned as a dominant negative form of RUNX1, resulting in enhanced self-renewal activity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Interestingly, ERK was heavily activated in both patients, highlighting a potential role for activation of MAPK signaling in iMCD-TAFRO pathogenesis and a rationale for exploring inhibition of the MAPK pathway as a therapy for iMCD-TAFRO. Moreover, these data suggest that iMCD-TAFRO might share pathogenetic features with clonal inflammatory disorders bearing MEK and RUNX1 mutations such as histiocytoses and myeloid neoplasms."
"Patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have adverse outcomes. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor copanlisib in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and assessed the relationship between efficacy and DLBCL cell of origin (COO; activated B-cell like [ABC] and germinal center B-cell like [GCB]) and other biomarkers. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in DLBCL COO subgroups (ABC, GCB, and unclassifiable) and by CD79B mutational status (NCT02391116). Sixty-seven patients received copanlisib (ABC DLBCL, n = 19; GCB DLBCL, n = 30; unclassifiable, n = 3; missing, n = 15). The ORR was 19.4%; 31.6% and 13.3% in ABC and GCB DLBCL patients, respectively. ORR was 22.2%/20.0% for patients with/without CD79B mutations (wild type, n = 45; mutant, n = 9; missing, n = 13). Overall median progression-free survival and duration of response were 1.8 and 4.3 months, respectively. Adverse events included hypertension (40.3%), diarrhea (37.3%), and hyperglycemia (32.8%). Aberrations were detected in 338 genes, including BCL2 (53.7%) and MLL2 (53.7%). A 16-gene signature separating responders from nonresponders was identified. Copanlisib treatment demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and a numerically higher response rate in ABC vs. GCB DLBCL patients."
"The goal of this study was to explore diagnostic colonoscopy completion in adults with abnormal screening fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results. This was a secondary analysis of the Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations (Stop CRC) study, a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial to increase uptake of CRC screening in federally qualified community health clinics. Diagnostic colonoscopy completion and reasons for non-completion were ascertained through a manual review of electronic health records, and completion was compared across a wide range of individual patient health and sociodemographic characteristics. Among 2,018 adults with an abnormal FIT result, 1066 (52.8%) completed a follow-up colonoscopy within 12 months. Completion was generally similar across a wide range of participant subpopulations; however, completion was higher for participants who were younger, Hispanic, Spanish-speaking, and had zero or one of the Charlson medical comorbidities, compared to their counterparts. Neighborhood-level predictors were not associated with diagnostic colonoscopy completion. Thus, completion of a diagnostic colonoscopy was relatively low in a large sample of community health clinic adults who had an abnormal screening FIT result. While completion was generally similar across a wide range of characteristics, younger, healthier, Hispanic participants tended to have a higher likelihood of completion."
"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) combined with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus concurrent chemotherapy (CC) will be the new standard treatment for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. However, many patients fail to receive CC for multiple reasons. We aimed to investigate long-term survival outcomes and toxicities in these patients with NPC treated with additional NAC plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or IMRT alone. In total, 1,378 previously untreated, newly diagnosed locoregionally advanced NPC patients receiving NAC plus IMRT with or without CC were retrospectively reviewed. We used a propensity score-matched (PSM) method with 1:1 matching to identify paired patients according to various covariates. Survival outcomes and toxicities were compared between the two groups. In total, 288 pairs were identified. With a median follow-up of 86 (range: 8–110) months, the estimated 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival rates in patients treated with NAC plus CCRT vs. NAC plus IMRT alone were 96.1% vs. 94.7% (P = 0.201), 93.7% vs. 89.8% (P = 0.129), 91.3% vs. 85.1% (P = 0.024), and 93.0% vs. 90.6% (P = 0.362), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that CC omission was a prognostic factor for worse PFS. In a subgroup analysis, PFS did not differ significantly between two groups of female patients or aged <60 years or stage T1–2 or stage N0-1 disease. However, fewer acute complications were observed in the NAC plus IMRT alone group. NAC with IMRT alone confers similar survival rates and less acute toxicities. Specifically, NAC plus IMRT alone may be enough for female patients <60 years with stage T1-2 or stage N0-1. However, a prospective randomised trial is needed to validate these results."
"Macrophage-initiated inflammation is tightly regulated to eliminate threats such as infections while suppressing harmful immune activation. However, individual cells’ signaling responses to pro-inflammatory cues are heterogeneous, with subpopulations emerging with high or low activation states. Here, we use single-cell tracking and dynamical modeling to develop and validate a revised model for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation that invokes a mechanism we term quorum licensing. The results show that bimodal phenotypic partitioning of macrophages is primed during the resting state, dependent on cumulative history of cell density, predicted by extrinsic noise in transcription factor expression, and independent of canonical LPS-induced intercellular feedback in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response. Our analysis shows how this density-dependent coupling produces a nonlinear effect on collective TNF production. We speculate that by linking macrophage density to activation, this mechanism could amplify local responses to threats and prevent false alarms."
"Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. Follow-on drug susceptibility testing (DST) requires additional sputum. Extract from the diamond-shaped chamber of the cartridge (dCE) of Ultra’s predecessor, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), is useful for MTBDRsl-based DST but this is unexplored with Ultra. Furthermore, whether CE from non-diamond compartments is useful, the performance of FluoroType MTBDR (FT) on  CE, and rpoB cross-contamination risk associated with the extraction procedure are unknown. We tested MTBDRsl, MTBDRplus, and FT on CEs from chambers from cartridges (Ultra, Xpert) tested on bacilli dilution series. MTBDRsl on Ultra dCE on TB-positive sputa (n = 40) was also evaluated and, separately, rpoB amplicon cross-contamination risk . MTBDRsl on Ultra dCE from dilutions ≥103 CFU/ml (CTmin <25, >“low semi-quantitation”) detected fluoroquinolone (FQ) and second-line injectable (SLID) susceptibility and resistance correctly (some SLIDs-indeterminate). At the same threshold (at which ~85% of Ultra-positives in our setting would be eligible), 35/35 (100%) FQ and 34/35 (97%) SLID results from Ultra dCE were concordant with sputa results. Tests on other chambers were unfeasible. No tubes open during 20 batched extractions had FT-detected rpoB cross-contamination. False-positive Ultra rpoB results was observed when dCE dilutions ≤10−3 were re-tested. MTBDRsl on Ultra dCE is concordant with isolate results. rpoB amplicon cross-contamination is unlikely. These data mitigate additional specimen collection for second-line DST and cross-contamination concerns."
"To understand and control intracranial pressure (ICP) is required for treatments in various clinical situations. To establish non-invasive ICP prediction method, we focused on the natural resonance frequency (NRF) of the brain. The ICP value, pulse waveform of intracranial pressure (PWICP) and cervical carotid pulse waveform (CCPW) were simultaneously collected from patients who underwent neurosurgical treatment. A total of 43 data were obtained from 27 patients. The total measured time was 29,653 seconds and the measured mean ICP value in each data ranged from 3.82 to 69.39 (mean 25.9) hPa. Respiratory synchronized cardiac pulses were selected and following CCPW and PWICP were collected. The transfer characteristics from collected CCPW to PWICP were calculated. The initial negative peak was judged as the NRF of the brain. The relationship between the ICP value and the NRF of the brain was presented on the quadratic functions graph (ICP = 0.0329(NRF)2 + 0.0842NRF; R2 = 0.9952). It means that the individual NRF only depends on their ICP value. The ICP value will be predicted by checking NRF of the brain from somewhere."
"The intrauterine and early life environments have been linked to the etiology of breast cancer in prior studies. We prospectively examined whether maternal and newborn anthropometric factors as reported by the mother are related to an increased incidence of adult breast cancer in the daughter. We used data from 35,133 mother-daughter dyads of the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) II and the Nurses’ Mothers’ Cohort Study. In 2001, living mothers of NHS II participants who were free of cancer completed a questionnaire on their pregnancy with the nurse and their nurse daughter’s early life experience. During 403,786 years of follow-up, 865 daughters developed incident cases of invasive breast cancer. Nurses with a birthweight of ≥4000 g had a 32% greater risk for breast cancer (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.71, p-trend = 0.09) compared with those with birthweights of 3000–3499 g. Higher birth length tended to increase risk of premenopausal breast cancer (p for trend = 0.05). We further noted a modest U-shaped relation between maternal weight gain during pregnancy and premenopausal breast cancer incidence in the daughter. Fetal growth may contribute to shaping later life risk for breast cancer, especially prior to menopause."
"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves outcomes in heart failure patients with wide QRS complex. However, CRT management following continuous flow Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implant vary: some centers continue CRT while others turn off the left ventricular (LV) lead at LVAD implant. We sought to study the effect of continued CRT versus turning off CRT pacing following continuous flow LVAD implantation. A comprehensive retrospective multicenter cohort of 295 patients with LVAD and pre-existing CRT was studied. CRT was programmed off after LVAD implant in 44 patients. We compared their outcomes to the rest of the cohort using univariate and multivariate models. Mean age was 60 ± 12 years, 83% were males, 52% had ischemic cardiomyopathy and 54% were destination therapy. Mean follow-up was 2.4 ± 2.0 years, and mean LVAD support time was 1.7 ± 1.4 years. Patients with CRT OFF had a higher Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) mean profile (3.9 vs 3.3, p = 0.01), more secondary prevention indication for a defibrillator (64.9% vs 44.5%, p = 0.023), and more pre-LVAD ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (77% vs 60%, p = 0.048). There were no differences between the CRT OFF and CRT ON groups in overall mortality (Log rank p = 0.32, adjusted HR = 1.14 [0.54–2.22], p = 0.71), heart transplantation, cardiac and noncardiac mortality, all cause hospitalizations, hospitalizations for ICD shocks, and number and frequency of ICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing therapy. There were no differences in post LVAD atrial arrhythmias (AA) (Adjusted OR = 0.45 [0.18–1.06], p = 0.31) and ventricular arrhythmias (OR = 0.65 [0.41–1.78], p = 0.41). There was no difference in change in LVEF, LV end diastolic and end systolic diameters between the 2 groups. Our study suggests that turning off CRT pacing after LVAD implantation in patients with previous CRT pacing did not affect mortality, heart transplantation, device therapies or arrhythmia burden. A prospective study is needed to confirm these findings."
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood, with a shift of symptoms including less hyperactivity/impulsivity and more co-morbidity of affective disorders in ADHDadult. Many studies have questioned the stability in diagnosing of ADHD from childhood to adulthood, and the shared and distinct aberrant functional connectivities (FCs) between ADHDchild and ADHDadult remain unidentified. We aim to explore shared and distinct FC patterns in ADHDchild and ADHDadult, and further investigated the cross-cohort predictability using the identified FCs. After investigating the ADHD-discriminative FCs from healthy controls (HCs) in both child (34 ADHDchild, 28 HCs) and adult (112 ADHDadult,77 HCs) cohorts, we identified both shared and distinct aberrant FC patterns between cohorts and their association with clinical symptoms. Moreover, the cross-cohort predictability using the identified FCs were tested. The ADHD-HC classification accuracies were 84.4% and 81.0% for children and male adults, respectively. The ADHD-discriminative FCs shared in children and adults lie in the intra-network within default mode network (DMN) and the inter-network between DMN and ventral attention network, positively correlated with total scores of ADHD symptoms. Particularly, inter-network FC between somatomotor network and dorsal attention network was uniquely impaired in ADHDchild, positively correlated with hyperactivity index; whereas the aberrant inter-network FC between DMN and limbic network exhibited more adult-specific ADHD dysfunction. And their cross-cohort predictions were 70.4% and 75.6% between each other. This work provided imaging evidence for symptomatic changes and pathophysiological continuity in ADHD from childhood to adulthood, suggesting that FCs may serve as potential biomarkers for ADHD diagnosis."
"The effects of quercetin liposomes (Q-PEGL) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy (DN) was investigated in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used to establish a STZ induced DN model. DN rats randomly received one of the following treatments for 8 weeks: blank treatment (DN), free quercetin (Que), pegylated liposomes (PEGL) and pegylated quercetin liposomes (Q-PEGL). A group of healthy rats served as the normal control. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), body weights (BWs), renal hypertrophy index (rHI), serum and urine biochemistry, renal histopathology, oxidative stress and immunohistochemical measurements of AGEs were analyzed to compare the effect of different treatments. Que and Q-PEGL significantly improved DN biochemistry and pathological changes, although the treated rats still had some symptoms of DN. The therapeutic effect of Q-PEGL surpassed that of Que. Pegylated quercetin liposomes allow maintaining higher quercetin concentrations in plasma than non-encapsulated quercetin. In conclusion the use of quercetin liposomes allows to reduce disease symptoms in a rat model of DN."
"Nocturnal Legs Cramps are a frequent disorder, which have a negative impact on quality of life, particularly among patients over 60 years old. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption have been shown to be associated with Nocturnal Leg Cramps. This study aimed to explore the association between nocturnal leg cramps and a sedentary lifestyle among elderly patients. A case-control study was conducted with a Bayesian approach for sensitivity analysis. Patients over 60 years old consulting their family doctor were recruited in the Alsace region, France. Cases were matched with controls free from cramps for age, sex, medical history and medications known to trigger cramps. The level of physical activity was assessed using the Dijon Physical Activity Score (DPAS). We performed univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for alcohol consumption. 272 participants were matched into 136 pairs. 11% of all were sedentary persons. Adjusting for alcohol consumption, we observed an association between Nocturnal Leg Cramps and a sedentary lifestyle OR = 9.84 (95% credibility interval [1.74; 101.9]; posterior probability 99.68%). Our findings represent an additional argument to promote physical activity to patients over 60 years old. They also highlight the need to develop and evaluate physical activity interventions in the treatment of Nocturnal Legs Cramps."
"Numerous epidemic models have been developed to capture aspects of human contact patterns, making model selection challenging when they fit (often-scarce) early epidemic data equally well but differ in predictions. Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the model’s age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy trade-off in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity."
"The aim of our study was to estimate regional and global cataract prevalence, its prevalence in different age groups, and the determinants of heterogeneity and its prevalence. For that, we used international databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and other sources of information to conduct a systematic search for all articles concerning the prevalence of age-related cataract and its types in different age groups. Of the 9922 identified articles, 45 studies with a sample size of 161,947 were included in the analysis, and most of them were from the Office for the Western Pacific Region (19 studies). Age- standardized pooled prevalence estimate (ASPPE) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of any cataract, cortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract were 17.20% (13.39–21.01), 8.05% (4.79–11.31), 8.22% (4.93–11.52), and 2.24% (1.41–3.07), respectively. Significant effects on heterogeneity were observed for the WHO region in the prevalence of any cataract (b: 6.30; p: 0.005) and study year in the prevalence of nuclear cataract (b: −0.66, p: 0.042). In general, the prevalence of cataract not only varies by region but also by age group, and most cases are over the age of 60 years. We examined the sources of variance in the prevalence of cataract and its different types, and identified age as a responsible factor in the prevalence of any cataract, cortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and PSC of cataract, WHO region in the prevalence of any cataract, and study year in the prevalence of nuclear cataract."
"Copper levels are known to be elevated in inflamed and malignant tissues. But the mechanism underlying this selective enrichment has been elusive. In this study, we report a axis by which inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, drive cellular copper uptake via the induction of a metalloreductase, STEAP4. IL-17-induced elevated intracellular copper level leads to the activation of an E3-ligase, XIAP, which potentiates IL-17-induced NFκB activation and suppresses the caspase 3 activity. Importantly, this IL-17-induced STEAP4-dependent cellular copper uptake is critical for colon tumor formation in a murine model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis and STEAP4 expression correlates with IL-17 level and XIAP activation in human colon cancer. In summary, this study reveals a IL-17-STEAP4-XIAP axis through which the inflammatory response induces copper uptake, promoting colon tumorigenesis."
"The diagnostic specificity of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is limited. We aimed to characterize eight anti-PSA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to assess the prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostic utility of different PSA molecular forms, total (t) and free (f) PSA and PSA complexed to α1-antichymotrypsin (complexed PSA). MAbs were obtained by immunization with PSA and characterized by competition studies, ELISAs and immunoblotting. With them, we developed sensitive and specific ELISAs for these PSA molecular forms and measured them in 301 PCa patients and 764 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, and analyzed their effectiveness to discriminate both groups using ROC curves. The free-to-total (FPR) and the complexed-to-total PSA (CPR) ratios significantly increased the diagnostic yield of tPSA. Moreover, based on model selection, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predictive PCa that includes tPSA, fPSA, and age as predictors, which reached an optimism-corrected area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.86. Our model outperforms the predictive ability of tPSA (AUC 0.71), used in clinical practice. In conclusion, The FPR and CPR showed better diagnostic yield than tPSA. In addition, the PCa predictive model including age, fPSA and complexed PSA, outperformed tPSA detection efficacy. Our model may avoid unnecessary biopsies, preventing harmful side effects and reducing health expenses."
"Addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug-resistant infections1. Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family2. Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter2. Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics—the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin—that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins—essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection."
"The mechanics of the cellular microenvironment continuously modulates cell functions such as growth, survival, apoptosis, differentiation and morphogenesis via cytoskeletal remodelling and actomyosin contractility1,2,3. Although all of these processes consume energy4,5, it is unknown whether and how cells adapt their metabolic activity to variable mechanical cues. Here we report that the transfer of human bronchial epithelial cells from stiff to soft substrates causes a downregulation of glycolysis via proteasomal degradation of the rate-limiting metabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). PFK degradation is triggered by the disassembly of stress fibres, which releases the PFK-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). Transformed non-small-cell lung cancer cells, which maintain high glycolytic rates regardless of changing environmental mechanics, retain PFK expression by downregulating TRIM21, and by sequestering residual TRIM21 on a stress-fibre subset that is insensitive to substrate stiffness. Our data reveal a mechanism by which glycolysis responds to architectural features of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thus coupling cell metabolism to the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. These processes enable normal cells to tune energy production in variable microenvironments, whereas the resistance of the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical cues enables the persistence of high glycolytic rates in cancer cells despite constant alterations of the tumour tissue."
"The protein O-GlcNAcylation catalysed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is tightly regulated by glucose availability. It is upregulated and essential for tumor cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions. However, the mechanism behind is still unclear. Here, we showed that the glycolytic regulator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), which also promotes cell cycle progression in the nucleus, was O-GlcNAcylated in response to hypoxia. The O-GlcNAcylation of PFKFB3 could compete phosphorylation by hypoxia-activated ERK at the same modification site Ser172. Phosphorylated PFKFB3 could interact with the protein G3BP2 and retain in the cytosol; this in turn led to the accumulation of hypoxia-induced-P27 in the nucleus resulting in the cell cycle arrest. Such a pathway was compromised by high level of PFKFB3 O-GlcNAcylation in tumor cells contributing to cell cycle progression. Consistently, the PFKFB3-Ser172 phosphorylation level inversely correlated with the OGT level in pancreatic cancer patients. Our findings uncovered an O-GlcNAcylation mediated mechanism to promote tumor cell proliferation under metabolic stress, linking the aberrant OGT activity to tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer."
"Dendritic atrophy, defined as the reduction in complexity of the neuronal arborization, is a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Rett Syndrome (RTT). RTT, affecting 1:10,000 girls worldwide, is mainly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and has no cure. We describe here an in vitro model of dendritic atrophy in Mecp2−/y mouse hippocampal primary cultures, suitable for phenotypic drug-screening. Using High-Content Imaging techniques, we systematically investigated the impact of culturing determinants on several parameters such as neuronal survival, total dendritic length, dendritic endpoints, soma size, cell clusterization, spontaneous activity. Determinants included cell-seeding density, glass or polystyrene substrates, coating with poly-Ornithine with/without Matrigel and miniaturization from 24 to 96-half surface multiwell plates. We show that in all plate-sizes at densities below 320 cells/mm2, morphological parameters remained constant while spontaneous network activity decreased according to the cell-density. Mecp2−/y neurons cultured at 160 cells/mm2 density in 96 multiwell plates, displayed significant dendritic atrophy and showed a marked increase in dendritic length following treatment with Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or Mirtazapine. In conclusion, we have established a phenotypic assay suitable for fast screening of hundreds of compounds, which may be extended to other neurodevelopmental diseases with dendritic atrophy."
"Although snoring is common in the general population, its aetiology has been largely understudied. Here we report a genetic study on snoring (n ~ 408,000; snorers ~ 152,000) using data from the UK Biobank. We identify 42 genome-wide significant loci, with an SNP-based heritability estimate of ~10% on the liability scale. Genetic correlations with body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa and neuroticism are observed. Gene-based associations identify 173 genes, including DLEU7, MSRB3 and POC5, highlighting genes expressed in the brain, cerebellum, lungs, blood and oesophagus. We use polygenic scores (PGS) to predict recent snoring and probable obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in an independent Australian sample (n ~ 8000). Mendelian randomization analyses suggest a potential causal relationship between high BMI and snoring. Altogether, our results uncover insights into the aetiology of snoring as a complex sleep-related trait and its role in health and disease beyond it being a cardinal symptom of OSA."
"The rarity of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) has precluded adequate data to incorporate minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring into therapy. Fluidity in MPAL classification systems further complicates understanding its biology and outcomes; this includes uncertainty surrounding the impact of shifting diagnostic requirements even between iterations of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Our primary objective was to address these knowledge gaps. To do so, we analyzed clinicopathologic features, therapy, MRD, and survival in a centrally-reviewed, multicenter cohort of MPAL uniformly diagnosed by the WHO classification and treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens. ALL induction therapy achieved an EOI MRD negative (<0.01%) remission in most patients (70%). EOI MRD positivity was predictive of 5-year EFS (HR = 6.00, p < 0.001) and OS (HR = 9.57, p = 0.003). Patients who cleared MRD by EOC had worse survival compared with those EOI MRD negative. In contrast to adults with MPAL, ALL therapy without transplantation was adequate to treat most pediatric patients. Earlier MRD clearance was associated with better treatment success and survival. Prospective trials are now necessary to validate and refine MRD thresholds within the pediatric MPAL population and to identify salvage strategies for those with poor predicted survival."
"Paediatric palliative care (PPC) is regarded as standard care for children and young people (CYP) with life-limiting conditions (LLCs). There is a lack of knowledge about the rate of CYP with LLCs, hampering the development of PPC. This retrospective study aimed to examine population-based statistics of South Korean CYP with LLCs and the pattern of healthcare use and costs in their last year of life, analysing the National Health Insurance Service claims database for the period 2013–2015. In 2015, the number of CYP (≤24 years old) living with LLCs was 133,177, with those who died accounting for 1,032. Prevalence of LLC and mortality rate per 100,000 were highest among under-1-age group (2,151.7 and 82.7, respectively). In the last year of life, 91.8% of deceased CYP with LLCs were hospitalized at least once and the average length of stay was 101.2 days (standard deviation = 104.1). Deceased CYP with cancer spent more on healthcare than non-cancer CYP (64,266 vs. 40,694 US dollar, p < 0.001). The average relevance index for CYP death related to LLCs was 55.9%. Our results provide baseline information on healthcare utilization and expenditure among CYP with LLCs, which is crucial data for designing evidence-based PPC policy and services."
"Predicting the outcome of immunotherapy treatment in melanoma patients is challenging. Alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation and the interferon gamma (IFNγ) pathway play an important role in the immune response to tumors. We describe here that the overexpression of PSMB8 and PSMB9, two major components of the immunoproteasome, is predictive of better survival and improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors of melanoma patients. We study the mechanism underlying this connection by analyzing the antigenic peptide repertoire of cells that overexpress these subunits using HLA peptidomics. We find a higher response of patient-matched tumor infiltrating lymphocytes against antigens diferentially presented after immunoproteasome overexpression. Importantly, we find that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels are much stronger predictors of melanoma patientsʼ immune response to checkpoint inhibitors than the tumors’ mutational burden. These results suggest that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels can serve as important biomarkers for stratifying melanoma patients for immune-checkpoint treatment."
"Headache is a common reason to visit the emergency department (ED). Tension-type headache (TTH) is the commonest headache. The diagnosis of TTH implies a mild condition, with no need for special tests. We evaluated the use of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for TTH in the ED. We performed a cross-sectional study including all ED patients with a definite TTH diagnosis in their discharge report for 2.5 years. We evaluated whether the ICHD criteria for TTH were referenced and met. We analysed discrepancies concerning anamnesis or prior history and reclassified patients. A total of 211 out of 2132 patients fulfilled the criteria (9.9%). Only five patients fulfilled TTH criteria. Criteria A-D were referenced in 60–84% of patients and met in 16–74% of these patients. Anamnesis was discrepant in 87.5% as was prior history in 20.8%. After re-reclassification, 21 patients fulfilled the criteria for TTH (five) or probable TTH (16). In 106 patients, another headache was diagnosed, with migraine in 40 (18.9%), secondary headache in 64 (30.3%), and a life-threatening disorder in 13 (6.1%). In our sample, TTH was overdiagnosed. Only a minority of patients fulfilled the ICHD criteria. Inconsistencies in prior medical history or anamnesis were frequent."
"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains cause symptomatic urinary tract infections in humans whereas commensal-like E. coli strains in the urinary bladder cause long-term asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). We previously reported that UPEC and ABU strains differentially regulate key DNA methylation and histone acetylation components in the surrogate insect host Galleria mellonella to epigenetically modulate innate immunity-related gene expression, which in turn controls bacterial growth. In this follow-up study, we infected G. mellonella larvae with UPEC strain CFT073 or ABU strain 83972 to identify differences in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Our small RNA sequencing analysis showed that UPEC and ABU infections caused significant changes in the abundance of miRNAs in the larvae, and highlighted the differential expression of 147 conserved miRNAs and 95 novel miRNA candidates. We annotated the G. mellonella genome sequence to investigate the miRNA-regulated expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides, signaling proteins, and enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in infected larvae. Our results indicate that miRNAs play a role in the epigenetic reprograming of innate immunity in G. mellonella larvae to distinguish between pathogenic and commensal strains of E. coli."
"Smooth muscle tumors represent the second most common mural mesenchymal neoplasm in the gastrointestinal tract, but established criteria for prognostic assessment of these tumors are lacking. A large cohort of surgically resected intramural gastrointestinal smooth muscle tumors from 31 institutions was analyzed to identify potential prognostic features. Pathologic features were assessed by expert gastrointestinal and/or soft tissue pathologists at each center. Immunohistochemical confirmation was required. A total of 407 cases from the esophagus (n = 97, 24%), stomach (n = 180, 44%), small bowel (n = 74, 18%), and colorectum (n = 56, 14%) were identified. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 92 years (mean 55 years), with a slight female predominance (57%). Mean tumor size was 5.4 cm, with the largest tumor measuring 29 cm. Disease progression following surgery, defined as local recurrence, metastasis, or disease-related death, occurred in 56 patients (14%). Colorectal tumors were most likely to progress, followed by small bowel and gastric tumors. None of the esophageal tumors in this series progressed. Receiver operator characteristic analysis identified optimal cutoffs of 9.8 cm and 3 mitoses/5 mm2 for discriminating between progressive and non-progressive tumors. Histologic features strongly associated with progression by univariate analysis included moderate-to-severe atypia, high cellularity, abnormal differentiation (defined as differentiation not closely resembling that of normal smooth muscle), tumor necrosis, mucosal ulceration, lamina propria involvement, and serosal involvement (P < 0.0001 for all features). Age, sex, and margin status were not significantly associated with progression (P = 0.23, 0.82, and 0.07, respectively). A risk assessment table was created based on tumor site, size, and mitotic count, and Kaplan–Meier plots of progression-free survival for each subgroup revealed progression-based tiers. Based on our findings, it appears that nonesophageal gastrointestinal smooth muscle tumors measuring >10 cm and/or showing ≥3 mitoses/5 mm2 may behave aggressively, and therefore close clinical follow-up is recommended in these cases."
"Current treatments for Alzheimer’s disease are only symptomatic and limited to reduce the progression rate of the mental deterioration. Mild Cognitive Impairment, a transitional stage in which the patient is not cognitively normal but do not meet the criteria for specific dementia, is associated with high risk for development of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, non-invasive techniques to predict the individual’s risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease can be very helpful, considering the possibility of early treatment. Diffusion Tensor Imaging, as an indicator of cerebral white matter integrity, may detect and track earlier evidence of white matter abnormalities in patients developing Alzheimer’s disease. Here we performed a voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy in three classes of subjects: Alzheimer’s disease patients, Mild Cognitive Impairment patients, and healthy controls. We performed Support Vector Machine classification between the three groups, using Fisher Score feature selection and Leave-one-out cross-validation. Bilateral intersection of hippocampal cingulum and parahippocampal gyrus (referred as parahippocampal cingulum) is the region that best discriminates Alzheimer’s disease fractional anisotropy values, resulting in an accuracy of 93% for discriminating between Alzheimer’s disease and controls, and 90% between Alzheimer’s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. These results suggest that pattern classification of Diffusion Tensor Imaging can help diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, specially when focusing on the parahippocampal cingulum."
"Inhalation of ricin toxin (RT), a Category B biothreat agent, provokes an acute respiratory distress syndrome marked by pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, neutrophilic exudate, and pulmonary edema. The severity of RT exposure is attributed to the tropism of the toxin’s B subunit (RTB) for alveolar macrophages and airway epithelial cells, coupled with the extraordinarily potent ribosome-inactivating properties of the toxin’s enzymatic subunit (RTA). While there are currently no vaccines or treatments approved to prevent RT intoxication, we recently described a humanized anti-RTA IgG1 MAb, huPB10, that was able to rescue non-human primates (NHPs) from lethal dose RT aerosol challenge if administered by intravenous (IV) infusion within hours of toxin exposure. We have now engineered an extended serum half-life variant of that MAb, huPB10-LS, and evaluated it as a pre-exposure prophylactic. Five Rhesus macaques that received a single intravenous infusion (25 mg/kg) of huPB10-LS survived a lethal dose aerosol RT challenge 28 days later, whereas three control animals succumbed to RT intoxication within 48 h. The huPB10-LS treated animals remained clinically normal in the hours and days following toxin insult, suggesting that pre-existing antibody levels were sufficient to neutralize RT locally. Moreover, pro-inflammatory markers in sera and BAL fluids collected 24 h following RT challenge were significantly dampened in huPB10-LS treated animals, as compared to controls. Finally, we found that all five surviving animals, within days after RT exposure, had anti-RT serum IgG titers against epitopes other than huPB10-LS, indicative of active immunization by residual RT and/or RT-immune complexes."
"Chronic inflammation has been linked to promotion of tumorigenesis and metastasis in lung. However, due to lack of a relevant animal model for characterization, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Lung tumor suppressor gene Gprc5a-knockout (ko) mice are susceptible to lung inflammation, tumorigenesis and metastasis, which resembles the pathological features in human patients. Here, we showed that PTGES/PGE2 signaling was highly associated with lung tumorigenesis and metastasis in Gprc5a-ko mice. Interestingly, Ptges-knockout in mouse lung tumor cells, although reduced their stemness and EMT-like features, still formed tumors and lung metastasis in immune-deficient nude mice, but not in immune-competent mice. This suggests that the major role of PTGES/PGE2 signaling in tumorigenicity and lung metastasis is through immunosuppression. Mechanistically, PTGES/PGE2 signaling intrinsically endows tumor cells resistant to T-cell cytotoxicity, and induces cytokines extrinsically for MDSC recruitment, which is crucial for suppression of T-cell immunity. Importantly, targeting PGE2 signaling in Gprc5a-ko mice by PTGES inhibitor suppressed MDSC recruitment, restored T cells, and significantly repressed lung metastasis. Thus, PTGES/PGE2 signaling links immunosuppression and metastasis in an inflammatory lung microenvironment of Gprc5a-ko mouse model."
"This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short- and mid-term outcomes of elderly patients who underwent surgery to treat left-sided native valve infective endocarditis (LSNIE). Between July 2005 and September 2015, 179 patients underwent surgical treatment for active LSNIE at a single institution. Patients were classified into two groups: ≥65 years (elderly group) and <65 years (non-elderly group). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and three-year survival rates were compared. The average ages were 74.2 ± 6.4 and 45.2 ± 12.6 years in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively. The elderly group had a higher predicted mortality rate and a lower incidence of preoperative septic emboli-related complications. Echocardiographic assessments of infected valves were generally homogenous between the groups. The elderly patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the non-elderly patients (26.3% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). For patients who survived to discharge, the three-year cumulative survival rates were 75.0% ± 8.2% and 81.2% ± 3.4% in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively (P = 0.484). In conclusion, elderly patients are at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality after surgery for LSNIE. However, once elderly patients are stabilized by surgical treatment and survive to discharge, the mid-term outcomes are promising."
"Portugal is a low incidence country for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Now figuring among TB low incidence countries, it has since the 1990s reported multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB cases, driven predominantly by two strain-types: Lisboa3 and Q1. This study describes the largest characterization of the evolutionary trajectory of M/XDR-TB strains in Portugal, spanning a time-period of two decades. By combining whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic susceptibility data for 207 isolates, we report the geospatial patterns of drug resistant TB, particularly the dispersion of Lisboa3 and Q1 clades, which underly 64.2% and 94.0% of all MDR-TB and XDR-TB isolates, respectively. Genomic-based similarity and a phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters (n = 16) reflecting ongoing and uncontrolled recent transmission of M/XDR-TB, predominantly associated with the Lisboa3 and Q1 clades. These clades are now thought to be evolving in a polycentric mode across multiple geographical districts. The inferred evolutionary history is compatible with MDR- and XDR-TB originating in Portugal in the 70’s and 80’s, respectively, but with subsequent multiple emergence events of MDR and XDR-TB particularly involving the Lisboa3 clade. A SNP barcode was defined for Lisboa3 and Q1 and comparison with a phylogeny of global strain-types (n = 28 385) revealed the presence of Lisboa3 and Q1 strains in Europe, South America and Africa. In summary, Portugal displays an unusual and unique epidemiological setting shaped by >40 years of uncontrolled circulation of two main phylogenetic clades, leading to a sympatric evolutionary trajectory towards XDR-TB with the potential for global reach."
"The dopamine D5 receptor (D5R) is a Gαs-coupled dopamine receptor belonging to the dopamine D1-like receptor family. Together with the dopamine D2 receptor it is highly expressed in striatal cholinergic interneurons and therefore is poised to be a positive regulator of cholinergic activity in response to L-DOPA in the dopamine-depleted parkinsonian brain. Tonically active cholinergic interneurons become dysregulated during chronic L-DOPA administration and participate in the expression of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. The molecular mechanisms involved in this process have not been elucidated, however a correlation between dyskinesia severity and pERK expression in cholinergic cells has been described. To better understand the function of the D5 receptor and how it affects cholinergic interneurons in L-DOPA induced dyskinesia, we used D5R knockout mice that were rendered parkinsonian by unilateral 6-OHDA injection. In the KO mice, expression of pERK was strongly reduced indicating that activation of these cells is at least in part driven by the D5 receptor. Similarly, pS6, another marker for the activity status of cholinergic interneurons was also reduced. However, mice lacking D5R exhibited slightly worsened locomotor performance in response to L-DOPA and enhanced LID scores. Our findings suggest that D5R can modulate L-DOPA induced dyskinesia and is a critical activator of CINs via pERK and pS6."
"Meal timing and composition are frequently reported in the literature as zeitgebers (that is, time cues) for the circadian system of humans and animal models, albeit secondary to light. Although widely assumed to be true, evidence for food zeitgeber effects specific to humans is notably scarce. Fostering zeitgeber hygiene in the general population as the development and practice of healthy use of zeitgebers could potentially reduce chronobiological strain, which is defined as disruption or misalignment within the circadian system. Such chronobiological strain is associated with modern 24/7 lifestyles (for example, shift work) and several negative health outcomes. Adjustments to meal timing and composition are an attractive strategy to synchronize circadian rhythms and develop zeitgeber hygiene. Thus, clarifying the actual effect of meal timing and composition on the human circadian system is a crucial piece of the human chronobiology puzzle. This Review weighs the evidence from human studies pertaining to the hypothesis that food is a circadian zeitgeber by comparing findings against formal zeitgeber criteria put forward by Jürgen Aschoff in the 1950s."
"Antiepileptic drug therapy has significant inter-patient variability in response towards it. The current study aims to understand this variability at the molecular level using microarray-based analysis of peripheral blood gene expression profiles of patients receiving valproate (VA) monotherapy. Only 10 unique genes were found to be differentially expressed in VA responders (n = 15) and 6 genes in the non-responders (n = 8) (fold-change >2, p < 0.05). PTGS2 which encodes cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2, showed downregulation in the responders compared to the non-responders. PTGS2/COX-2 mRNA profiles in the two groups corresponded to their plasma profiles of the COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Since COX-2 is believed to regulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a multidrug efflux transporter over-expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in drug-resistant epilepsy, the pathway connecting COX-2 and P-gp was further explored in vitro. Investigation of the effect of VA upon the brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) in hyperexcitatory conditions confirmed suppression of COX-2-dependent P-gp upregulation by VA. Our findings suggest that COX-2 downregulation by VA may suppress seizure-mediated P-gp upregulation at the BBB leading to enhanced drug delivery to the brain in the responders. Our work provides insight into the association of peripheral PTGS2/COX-2 expression with VA efficacy and the role of COX-2 as a potential therapeutic target for developing efficacious antiepileptic treatment."
"Evidence for the efficacy of denosumab in HD patients is limited. Accordingly, here we report a study on the safety and efficacy of denosumab in these patients. We prospectively followed 324 patients (121 HD and 203 non-HD patients) receiving denosumab between June 2013 and May 2018, assessing changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolic markers, and noting side-effects. Annual changes in BMD at the lumbar spine in HD and non-HD patients from baseline were, respectively, 6.7 ± 11.1% and 7.5 ± 10.2% (p = 0.60), those at the femoral neck were 4.3 ± 7.9% and 3.1 ± 9.5% (p = 0.32), and those at the distal radius were −0.5 ± 6.4% and 0.2 ± 13.0% (p = 0.66). The prevalence of hypocalcemia (<8.5 mg/dL) was significantly higher in HD than in non-HD patients (35.6% vs 5.4%, p < 0.001). The median elapsed time between the first injection of denosumab and the occurrence of hypocalcemia was 7 days in HD patients. The decrease of serum calcium was greater in patients with higher TRACP5b, corticosteroid use, and those without CaCO3 supplementation. Our study suggests that denosumab was equally as effective in HD as non-HD patients. However, careful hypocalcemia monitoring, for at least 4 weeks, is recommended for HD patients."
"Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) experience significant heterogeneity regarding depth and speed of responses. Factors intrinsic and extrinsic to CML cells contribute to response heterogeneity and TKI resistance. Among extrinsic factors, cytokine-mediated TKI resistance has been demonstrated in CML progenitors, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified differentially expressed splicing factors in primary CD34+ chronic phase (CP) CML progenitors and controls. We found SRSF1 expression to be increased as a result of both BCR-ABL1- and cytokine-mediated signaling. SRSF1 overexpression conferred cytokine independence to untransformed hematopoietic cells and impaired imatinib sensitivity in CML cells, while SRSF1 depletion in CD34+ CP CML cells prevented the ability of extrinsic cytokines to decrease imatinib sensitivity. Mechanistically, PRKCH and PLCH1 were upregulated by elevated SRSF1 levels, and contributed to impaired imatinib sensitivity. Importantly, very high SRSF1 levels in the bone marrow of CML patients at presentation correlated with poorer clinical TKI responses. In summary, we find SRSF1 levels to be maintained in CD34+ CP CML progenitors by cytokines despite effective BCR-ABL1 inhibition, and that elevated levels promote impaired imatinib responses. Together, our data support an SRSF1/PRKCH/PLCH1 axis in contributing to cytokine-induced impaired imatinib sensitivity in CML."
"Ceramide accumulation is a hallmark in the manifestation of numerous obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Until the early 2000s, ceramides were viewed as a homogenous class of sphingolipids. However, it has now become clear that ceramides exert fundamentally different effects depending on the specific fatty acyl chain lengths, which are integrated into ceramides by a group of enzymes known as dihydroceramide synthases. In addition, alterations in ceramide synthesis, trafficking and metabolism in specific cellular compartments exert distinct consequences on metabolic homeostasis. Here, we examine the emerging concept of how the intracellular localization of ceramides with distinct acyl chain lengths can regulate glucose metabolism, thus emphasizing their potential as targets in the development of novel and specific therapies for obesity and obesity-associated diseases."
"A substantial amount of life-sciences research has been performed in space since the beginning of human spaceflight. Investigations into bone loss, for example, are well known; other areas, such as neurovestibular function, were expected to be problematic even before humans ventured into space. Much of this research has been applied research, with a primary goal of maintaining the health and performance of astronauts in space, as opposed to research to obtain fundamental understanding or to translate to medical care on Earth. Some people—scientists and concerned citizens—have questioned the broader scientific value of this research, with the claim that the only reason to perform human research in space is to keep humans healthy in space. Here, we present examples that demonstrate that, although this research was focused on applied goals for spaceflight participants, the results of these studies are of fundamental scientific and biomedical importance. We will focus on results from bone physiology, cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, and neurovestibular studies. In these cases, findings from spaceflight research have provided a foundation for enhancing healthcare terrestrially and have increased our knowledge of basic physiological processes."
"Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) delivered at imperceptible intensities can improve vestibular function in health and disease. Here we evaluated whether nGVS effects on vestibular function are only present during active stimulation or may exhibit relevant post-stimulation after-effects. Initially, nGVS amplitudes that optimally improve posture were determined in 13 healthy subjects. Subsequently, effects of optimal nGVS amplitudes on vestibular roll-tilt direction recognition thresholds (DRT) were examined during active and sham nGVS. Ten of 13 subjects exhibited reduced DRTs during active nGVS compared to sham stimulation (p < 0.001). These 10 participants were then administered to 30 mins of active nGVS treatment while being allowed to move freely. Immediately post-treatment , DRTs were increased again (p = 0.044), reverting to baseline threshold levels (i.e. were comparable to the sham nGVS thresholds), and remained stable in a follow-up assessment after 30 min. After three weeks, participants returned for a follow-up experiment to control for learning effects, in which DRTs were measured during and immediately after 30 min application of sham nGVS. DRTs during both assessments did not differ from baseline level. These findings indicate that nGVS does not induce distinct post-stimulation effects on vestibular motion perception and favor the development of a wearable technology that continuously delivers nGVS to patients in order to enhance vestibular function."
"To study differences in SRB1 gene expression between Candida albicans fluconazole-resistant strains and fluconazole-sensitive strains, and to identify new antifungal drug treatment targets. We studied 30 fluconazole-resistant and 47 fluconazole-sensitive C. albicans strains. The strains were routinely cultured, and total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA and analyzed with real-time PCR amplification with 18S rRNA used as an internal reference gene. The expression levels of the two groups were analyzed in Light Cycler system software version 3.0, and independent Student’s t test was performed in SPSS 19.0 statistical software. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistical difference. DNAMAN multiple sequence alignment analysis was used to randomly analyze SBR1 related sequences of four resistant strains and four sensitive strains. An evolutionary tree was constructed with the maximum likelihood method in Mega6.0 software. The mean SRB1 gene expression in the drug-resistant group was 0.75138 × 10–3, and that in the sensitive group was 1.6664 × 10–3. Independent Student’s t test indicated a statistically significant difference (T = −3.972, P = 0.000, P < 0.05). DNAMAN multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that the sequence identity of the CDS in the eight strains was 75.17%, and that of sequences 1000 bp upstream of the CDS was 96.35%. Cluster analysis showed that the CDS and sequences 1000 bp upstream of the CDS showed no significant differences between groups. At the mRNA level, the SRB1 gene expression in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans was lower than that in fluconazole-sensitive strains, thus suggesting that the gene may be associated with drug resistance and that the regulatory mechanism leading to this difference is complex."
"Structural chromosomal rearrangements that can lead to in-frame gene-fusions are a leading source of information for diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Traditional methods such as karyotyping and FISH struggle to accurately identify and phase such large-scale chromosomal aberrations in ALL genomes. We therefore evaluated linked-read WGS for detecting chromosomal rearrangements in primary samples of from 12 patients diagnosed with ALL. We assessed the effect of input DNA quality on phased haplotype block size and the detectability of copy number aberrations and structural variants in the ALL genomes. We found that biobanked DNA isolated by standard column-based extraction methods was sufficient to detect chromosomal rearrangements even at low 10x sequencing coverage. Linked-read WGS enabled precise, allele-specific, digital karyotyping at a base-pair resolution for a wide range of structural variants including complex rearrangements and aneuploidy assessment. With use of haplotype information from the linked-reads, we also identified previously unknown structural variants, such as a compound heterozygous deletion of ERG in a patient with the DUX4-IGH fusion gene. We conclude that linked-read WGS allows detection of important pathogenic variants in ALL genomes at a resolution beyond that of traditional karyotyping and FISH."
"BackgroundProstate cancer focal therapy aims to minimize the side-effects of whole gland treatments, such as radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy without compromising oncological efficacy. However, concerns exist regarding the multifocal nature of prostate cancer and the lack of long-term oncological data for this form of treatment. In recent years, the routine adoption of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate has improved our ability to select candidates for focal therapy and to accurately deliver this form of prostate cancer treatment.MethodsWe performed a review of the literature to provide a summary of the oncological and functional outcomes of men receiving primary prostate focal therapy. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the routine implementation of mpMRI as part of the initial prostate cancer diagnostic pathway on the selection of candidates and delivery of focal therapy. Finally, we summarize knowledge gaps in the field and highlight active clinical trials in this arena.ResultsPrimary focal therapy involves the application of one of a number of energies that ablate tissue, such as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Success is principally dependent on highly accurate patient selection and disease localization underpinned in large part by the routine integration of pre-biopsy mpMRI. Prospective medium-term follow-up data for primary HIFU and cryotherapy for men with intermediate-risk disease have shown acceptable cancer control with low risk of side effects and complications. Additional research is needed to clearly define an appropriate follow-up approach and to guide the management of in- and out-of-field recurrences. Multiple comparative trials with randomization against standard care are currently underway in men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.ConclusionThe widespread adoption of prostate mpMRI has led to improved disease localization, enabling the performance of focal therapy as a viable treatment strategy for men with low volume intermediate-risk prostate cancer."
"Findings from previous meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) varied as to whether clinical outcomes differed by type of animal-derived pulmonary surfactant; real-world evidence (RWE) was excluded. We extracted study characteristics and outcomes from full-text articles from a systematic search for studies that compared beractant with poractant alfa for RDS in preterm infants. RWE data were tabulated; RCT data were subjected to meta-analyses. Designs, patient characteristics, and follow-up durations varied widely among studies (4 RWE, 15 RCT). RWE studies with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) found no statistically significant between-treatment differences in outcomes. In RCT meta-analyses, no statistically significant between-treatment differences were observed for death (OR [95% confidence interval], 1.35 [0.98–1.86]), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1.25 [0.96–1.62]), pneumothorax (1.21 [0.72–2.05]), and air leak syndrome (2.28 [0.82–6.39]). Collectively, outcomes were similar with beractant and poractant alfa in RWE studies and pooled RCTs."
"The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) technology to predict postoperative recurrence risk among stage IV colorectal cancer patients. Four basic ML algorithms were used for prediction—logistic regression, decision tree, GradientBoosting and lightGBM. The research samples were randomly divided into a training group and a testing group at a ratio of 8:2. 999 patients with stage 4 colorectal cancer were included in this study. In the training group, the GradientBoosting model’s AUC value was the highest, at 0.881. The Logistic model’s AUC value was the lowest, at 0.734. The GradientBoosting model had the highest F1_score (0.912). In the test group, the AUC Logistic model had the lowest AUC value (0.692). The GradientBoosting model’s AUC value was 0.734, which can still predict cancer progress. However, the gbm model had the highest AUC value (0.761), and the gbm model had the highest F1_score (0.974). The GradientBoosting model and the gbm model performed better than the other two algorithms. The weight matrix diagram of the GradientBoosting algorithm shows that chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time were the five most influential risk factors for tumor recurrence. The four machine learning algorithms can each predict the risk of tumor recurrence in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer after surgery. Among them, GradientBoosting and gbm performed best. Moreover, the GradientBoosting weight matrix shows that the five most influential variables accounting for postoperative tumor recurrence are chemotherapy, age, LogCEA, CEA and anesthesia time."
"Chemotherapy is the standard care for patients with gastric cancer (GC); however, resistance to existing drugs has limited its success. The persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is considered to be responsible for treatment failure. In this study, we demonstrated that SIRT1 expression was significantly downregulated in GC tissues, and that a low SIRT1 expression level indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients. We observed a suppressive role of SIRT1 in chemoresistance of GC both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that SIRT1 eliminated CSC properties of GC cells. Mechanistically, SIRT1 exerted inhibitory activities on chemoresistance and CSC properties through FOXO3 and AMPK. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was revealed between FOXO3 and AMPK. AMPK promoted nuclear translocation of FOXO3 and enhanced its transcriptional activities. In addition, FOXO3 increased the expression level and activation of AMPKα by directly binding to its promoter and activating the transcription of AMPKα. Similar to SIRT1, low expression levels of p-AMPKα and FOXO3a are also related to the poor prognosis of GC patients. Moreover, we revealed a correlation between the expression levels of SIRT1, p-AMPKα, and FOXO3a. These findings indicated the importance of the SIRT1-AMPK/FOXO3 pathway in reversing chemoresistance and CSC properties of GC. Thus, exploring efficient strategies to activate the SIRT1-AMPK/FOXO3 pathway may lead to improving the survival of GC patients."
"We recently identified nitroxoline as a repurposed drug candidate in pancreatic cancer (PC) showing a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity in different PC cell lines. This antibiotic is effective in several in vitro and animal cancer models. To date, the mechanisms of nitroxoline anticancer action are largely unknown. Using shotgun proteomics we identified 363 proteins affected by nitroxoline treatment in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, including 81 consistently deregulated at both 24- and 48-hour treatment. These proteins previously unknown to be affected by nitroxoline were mostly downregulated and interconnected in a single highly-enriched network of protein-protein interactions. Integrative proteomic and functional analyses revealed nitroxoline-induced downregulation of Na/K-ATPase pump and β-catenin, which associated with drastic impairment in cell growth, migration, invasion, increased ROS production and induction of DNA damage response. Remarkably, nitroxoline induced a previously unknown deregulation of molecules with a critical role in cell bioenergetics, which resulted in mitochondrial depolarization. Our study also suggests that deregulation of cytosolic iron homeostasis and of co-translational targeting to membrane contribute to nitroxoline anticancer action. This study broadens our understanding of the mechanisms of nitroxoline action, showing that the drug modulates multiple proteins crucial in cancer biology and previously unknown to be affected by nitroxoline."
"A diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with a heterogeneous psychopathology including positive and negative symptoms. The disconnection hypothesis, an early pathophysiological framework conceptualizes the diversity of symptoms as a result of disconnections in neural networks. In line with this hypothesis, previous neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia reported alterations within the default mode network (DMN), the most prominent network at rest. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional connectivity during rest in patients with schizophrenia and with healthy individuals and explore whether observed functional alterations are related to the psychopathology of patients. Therefore, functional magnetic resonance images at rest were recorded of 35 patients with schizophrenia and 41 healthy individuals. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract resting state networks. Comparing ICA results between groups indicated alterations only within the network of the DMN. More explicitly, reduced connectivity in the precuneus was observed in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Connectivity in this area was negatively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms, more specifically with the domain of apathy. Taken together, the current results provide further evidence for a role DMN alterations might play in schizophrenia and especially in negative symptoms such as apathy."
"Although tumour-treating fields (TTFields) is a promising physical treatment modality based on disruption of dipole alignments and generation of dielectrophoretic forces during cytokinesis, not much is known about TTFields-responsive sensitisers. Here, we report a novel TTFields-responsive sensitiser, barium titanate nanoparticles (BTNPs), which exhibit cytocompatibility, with non-cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells. BTNPs are characterised by high dielectric constant values and ferroelectric properties. Notably, we found that BTNPs sensitised TTFields-resistant breast cancer cells in response to TTFields. In addition, BTNPs accumulated in the cytoplasm of cancer cells in response to TTFields. Further, we showed that TTFields combined with BTNPs exhibited antitumor activity by modulating several cancer-related pathways in general, and the cell cycle-related apoptosis pathway in particular. Therefore, our data suggest that BTNPs increase the antitumor action of TTFields by an electric field-responsive cytosolic accumulation, establishing BTNP as a TTFields-responsive sensitiser."
"PEGylated recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (pegfilgrastim) is used clinically to accelerate immune reconstitution following chemotherapy and is being pursued for biosimilar development. One challenge to overcome in pegfilgrastim biosimilar development is establishing pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity, which is partly due to the degree of PK variability. We herein report that commercially available G-CSF and PEG ELISA detection kits have different capacities to detect pegfilgrastim aggregates that rapidly form in vitro in physiological conditions. These aggregates can be observed using SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and real-time NMR analysis and are associated with decreased bioactivity as reflected by reduced drug-induced cellular proliferation and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, individual variability in the stability and detectability of pegfilgrastim in human sera is also observed. Pegfilgrastim levels display marked subject variability in sera from healthy donors incubated at 37 °C. The stability patterns of pegfilgrastim closely match the stability patterns of filgrastim, consistent with a key role for pegfilgrastim’s G-CSF moiety in driving formation of inactive aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that individual variability and ELISA specificity for inactive aggregates are key factors to consider when designing and interpreting studies involving the measurement of serum pegfilgrastim concentrations."
"Success of immunotherapeutic approaches using genetically engineered antibodies and T cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) depends, among other things, on the selection of antigen binding domains with desirable expression and binding characteristics. We developed a luciferase-based assay, termed Malibu-Glo Assay, which streamlines the process of optimization of an antigen binding domain with desirable properties and allows the sensitive detection of tumor antigens. The assay involves a recombinant immunoconjugate, termed Malibu-Glo reagent, comprising an immunoglobulin or a non-immunoglobulin based antigen binding domain genetically linked to a marine luciferase. Malibu-Glo reagent can be conveniently produced in mammalian cells as a secreted protein that retains the functional activity of both the antigen binding domain and the luciferase. Moreover, crude supernatant containing the secreted Malibu-Glo reagent can directly be used for detection of cell surface antigens obviating the laborious steps of protein purification and labeling. We further demonstrate the utility of Malibu-Glo assay for the selection of optimal single chain fragment variables (scFvs) with desired affinity characteristics for incorporation into CARs. In summary, Malibu-Glo assay is a fast, simple, sensitive, specific and economical assay for antigen detection with multiple applications in the fields of antibody engineering, antibody humanization and CAR-T cell therapy."
"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery was recently approved for the treatment of inherited blindness and spinal muscular atrophy, and long-term therapeutic effects have been achieved for other rare diseases, including haemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, current research indicates that the genetic modification of AAV vectors may further facilitate the success of AAV gene therapy. Vector engineering can increase AAV transduction efficiency (by optimizing the transgene cassette), vector tropism (using capsid engineering) and the ability of the capsid and transgene to avoid the host immune response (by genetically modifying these components), as well as optimize the large-scale production of AAV."
"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) of PD-1 and CTLA-4 to treat metastatic melanoma (MM) has variable therapeutic benefit. To explore this in peripheral samples, we characterized CD8+ T cell gene expression across a cohort of patients with MM receiving anti-PD-1 alone (sICB) or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 (cICB). Whereas CD8+ transcriptional responses to sICB and cICB involve a shared gene set, the magnitude of cICB response is over fourfold greater, with preferential induction of mitosis- and interferon-related genes. Early samples from patients with durable clinical benefit demonstrated overexpression of T cell receptor–encoding genes. By mapping T cell receptor clonality, we find that responding patients have more large clones (those occupying >0.5% of repertoire) post-treatment than non-responding patients or controls, and this correlates with effector memory T cell percentage. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of eight post-treatment samples demonstrates that large clones overexpress genes implicated in cytotoxicity and characteristic of effector memory T cells, including CCL4, GNLY and NKG7. The 6-month clinical response to ICB in patients with MM is associated with the large CD8+ T cell clone count 21 d after treatment and agnostic to clonal specificity, suggesting that post-ICB peripheral CD8+ clonality can provide information regarding long-term treatment response and, potentially, facilitate treatment stratification."
"Identifying biological correlates of late life cognitive function is important if we are to ascertain biomarkers for, and develop treatments to help reduce, age-related cognitive decline. Here, we investigated the associations between plasma levels of 90 neurology-related proteins (Olink® Proteomics) and general fluid cognitive ability in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936, N = 798), Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921, N = 165), and the INTERVAL BioResource (N = 4451). In the LBC1936, 22 of the proteins were significantly associated with general fluid cognitive ability (β between −0.11 and −0.17). MRI-assessed total brain volume partially mediated the association between 10 of these proteins and general fluid cognitive ability. In an age-matched subsample of INTERVAL, effect sizes for the 22 proteins, although smaller, were all in the same direction as in LBC1936. Plasma levels of a number of neurology-related proteins are associated with general fluid cognitive ability in later life, mediated by brain volume in some cases."
"Despite some studies showing seasonal variations in mortality and the transition to renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease, detailed evidence is still scarce. We investigated seasonal variations in patients with end-stage renal disease using a large Japanese database for dialysis patients. We compared the fractions of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and the transition to renal replacement therapy among seasons and performed a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis to compare the mortality among seasons after adjustment for some variables. The initiation of hemodialysis was highest in winter and lowest in summer. Seasonality in the initiation of peritoneal dialysis and transition to kidney transplantation differed from hemodialysis. All-cause mortality was highest in the winter and lowest in the summer. Death from coronary artery disease, heart failure, cerebral hemorrhage, and infectious pneumonia had similar seasonality, but death from cerebral infarction, septicemia, or malignant tumor did not have similar seasonality. In conclusion, the initiation of hemodialysis, all-cause mortality, and mortality from coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebral hemorrhage, and infectious pneumonia were significantly highest in winter and lowest in summer. However, the initiation of peritoneal dialysis, transition to kidney transplantation, or mortality from cerebral infarction, septicemia, or malignant tumor did not have similar seasonal variations."
"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, or L1) is the only autonomous retrotransposon that is active in human cells. Different host factors have been shown to influence L1 mobility; however, systematic analyses of these factors are limited. Here, we developed a high-throughput microscopy-based retrotransposition assay that identified the double-stranded break (DSB) repair and Fanconi anemia (FA) factors active in the S/G2 phase as potent inhibitors and regulators of L1 activity. In particular, BRCA1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a key role in several DNA repair pathways, directly affects L1 retrotransposition frequency and structure and plays a distinct role in controlling L1 ORF2 protein translation through L1 mRNA binding. These results suggest the existence of a ‘battleground’ at the DNA replication fork between homologous recombination (HR) factors and L1 retrotransposons and reveal a potential role for L1 in the genotypic evolution of tumors characterized by BRCA1 and HR repair deficiencies."
"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a key role in the maintenance of overall cellular health. While it has been suggested that autophagy may elicit cardioprotective and pro-survival modulating functions, excessive activation of autophagy can also be detrimental. In this regard, the zebrafish is considered a hallmark model for vertebrate regeneration, since contrary to adult mammals, it is able to faithfully regenerate cardiac tissue. Interestingly, the role that autophagy may play in zebrafish heart regeneration has not been studied yet. In the present work, we hypothesize that, in the context of a well-established injury model of ventricular apex resection, autophagy plays a critical role during cardiac regeneration and its regulation can directly affect the zebrafish regenerative potential. We studied the autophagy events occurring upon injury using electron microscopy, in vivo tracking of autophagy markers, and protein analysis. Additionally, using pharmacological tools, we investigated how rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, affects regeneration relevant processes. Our results show that a tightly regulated autophagic response is triggered upon injury and during the early stages of the regeneration process. Furthermore, treatment with rapamycin caused an impairment in the cardiac regeneration outcome. These findings are reminiscent of the pathophysiological description of an injured human heart and hence put forward the zebrafish as a model to study the poorly understood double-sword effect that autophagy has in cardiac homeostasis."
