"Aim The aim of this study was to investigate effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) and manual acupuncture (MA) on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back. Methods A total of 66 randomly allocated patients diagnosed with chronic LBP were assigned to receive either 12 sessions of acupuncture or electroacupuncture. The primary outcomes measurements were intensity pain (NRS) and disability (RMQ). All main analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. Results The groups reported improvements posttreatment in intensity pain and disability respectively; however, no differences between groups were observed. Regarding the secondary outcomes, we observed a between-group difference only for kinesiophobia in favor of the manual acupuncture group (difference = −4.1 points, 95% CI = −7.0 to −1.1). The results were maintained after 3 months of follow-up. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, EA did not result in a better outcome compared with MA treatment. Conclusion The study does not provide evidence that an electroacupuncture is superior to acupuncture treatment. Both therapies had similar efficacy in reducing pain and disability for chronic nonspecific low back pain. "
"Background and Objective Needle insertion pain during spinal anesthesia is an unpleasant experience for patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on the pain intensity during the insertion of spinal needles in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, ImamReza hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2018. Materials and Methods In a double-blind clinical trial, 60 candidates for elective Trans Ureteral Lithotripsy surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The electrodes of the TENS device were placed in the space between L3-L4 and L5-S1 vertebrae. The intensity of pain during insertion of the spinal needle by Visual Analog Scale and the frequency of attempts were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 19. Trans Ureteral Lithotripsy Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Trans Ureteral Lithotripsy Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Results The study samples were 41.66% female and 58.33% male. The mean age of the study samples was 34.26 ± 5.07 and 32.8 ± 5.28 in the control and intervention group, respectively. The pain intensity during insertion of spinal needles was less significant in the intervention group compared to the control group (P = 0.001). The number of attempts to insert the spinal needle between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.51). The duration of implementation spinal anesthesia procedure by physician was less significant in the intervention group (P=0.001). Conclusion According to the results of the study, the use of TENS effectively reduced the pain of spinal needle insertion. Considering these beneficial effects, it is suggested that this procedure be used to relive pain in patients with spinal anesthesia. "
"The prevalence of elderly dementia and work-related back neck pain is high, and so is the associated cost. Is dementia, which can take 20–30 years to develop, linked to musculoskeletal problems earlier in life? Classic Chinese Medicine Governor Vessel theory has detailed a correlation, but its acceptance appears to be influenced and even limited by some inconsistences in the literature. This study involved a nationwide online questionnaire of 381 practicing acupuncturists to investigate Governor Vessel’s usage and impact on brain function. The survey covers areas of the acupuncturist’s experience, perception of Governor Vessel usage, related symptoms, needling concerns and correlations with brain function. 39 completed questionnaires were returned, of which 38 were Governor Vessel users, and nearly three quarters of respondents accepted that Governor Vessel influences brain function. Only two respondents rejected this influence, but here several inconsistencies were found. The associations with Governor Vessel were predominately found to be with the spine, kidney and brain. Indications from practitioners suggested numerous forms of clinical usage of Governor Vessel, predominately on spinal, cognitive and qi-blood movement issues. Governor Vessel influence on the brain was accepted by most respondents with only a few expressing uncertainty. Further worldwide, larger population, in-depth studies and trials are needed to fully establish and expand upon these findings."
"This study evaluates the effects of a short-term Cardio Tai Chi program on the cardiorespiratory fitness and hemodynamic parameters in sedentary adults. Thirty-one sedentary participants (age: 58 ± 9 years, body mass: 63 ± 12 kg) were subjected to an exercise program during 10 sessions over a 10-day period within 2 weeks. The Cardio Tai Chi program consisted in a series of three to five intervals lasting 90 s each at ∼70% maximal heart rate separated by 2-min of low-intensity recovery. Primary outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak) assessed by the Rockport walking test and resting hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures). We observed a significant difference of means on post-pre V˙O2peak [4.5 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1 to 5.8, p = 0.004], systolic blood pressure (-5.5 mmHg, 95% CI:-7.3 to -3.8, p = 0.010) and pulse pressure (-3.7 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.2 to -2.3, p = 0.028). No significant differences were observed for diastolic pressure (−1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.6 to -1.0, p = 0.226), mean blood pressure (2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.6, p = 0.302), or resting heart rate (-0.9 beat/min, 95% CI: -2.0 to 0.1, p = 0.631). Our findings suggest that engaging in a short-term Cardio Tai Chi program can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and hemodynamic parameters in sedentary adults."
"This study investigates whether visual deprivation influences participants' accuracy in differentiating between real and sham acupuncture needles. It also evaluates the relative contributions of tactile, visual, and auditory cues that participants use in their decision-making processes. In addition, a simple sensory decision-making model for research using acupuncture sham devices as comparative controls is proposed. Forty healthy individuals underwent two conditions (blindfolded and sighted) in random sequence. Four sham and four real needles were randomly applied to the participants' lower limb acupoints (ST32 to ST39). Participants responded which needle type was applied. Participants then verbally answered a questionnaire on which sensory cues influenced their decision-making. The proportion of correct judgments, P(C), was calculated to indicate the participants' accuracy in distinguishing between the needle types. Visual deprivation did not significantly influence the participants' discrimination accuracy. Tactile cues were the dominant sensory modality used in decision-making, followed by visual and auditory cues. Sharp and blunt sensations were associated with the real and sham needles, respectively, for both conditions. This study confirmed that tactile cues were the main sensory modalities used in participant decision-making during acupuncture administration. Also, short-term blindfolding of participants during procedures will unlikely influence blinding effectiveness. Clinical trial registration number Not applicable. This study does not fall under the definition of a clinical trial under the ICMJE guidelines. "
"The primo vascular system (PVS) is reported to have a periductium composed of cells with spherical or spindle-shaped nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. However, little is known about these periductium cells. In this study, we examined the morphological features of cells covering the PVS tissue isolated from the surface of abdominal organs of rats. By hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, we observed a layer of dark nuclei on the basement membrane at the borders of the sections of primo node (PN), primo vessel (PV), and their subunits. The nuclei appeared thin and linear (10-14 μm), elliptical (8-10 × 3-4 μm), and round (5-7 μm). The borders of the PVS tissue sections were immunostained with a selective antibody for mesothelial cells (MCs). Areas of immunoreactivity overlapped with the flattened cells are shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining. By scanning electron microscopy, we further identified elliptical (11 × 21 μm) and rectangular squamous MCs (length, 10 μm). There were numerous stomata (∼200 nm) and microparticles (20-200 nm) on the surface of the PVS MCs. In conclusion, this study presents the novel finding that the PVS periductium is composed of squamous MCs. These cells tightly line the luminal surface of the PVS tissue, including PNs, PVs, and small branches of the PVs in the abdominal cavity. These results will help us to understand the physiological roles such as hyaluronan secretion and the fine structure of PVS tissue. "
"Acupuncture is one of the areas among the alternative therapies that arise high curiosity in the biomedical scientific community. It is particularly popular for treatment of chronic diseases and addictions. However, contrasting with its evidence-based effectiveness, the lack of reasonable explanations for its mode of action divides that scientific community. Difficulties also arise to those responsible for providing information for clinicians and professionals who wish to acquire competencies leading to the acupuncture practice and have a background based on biochemistry and physiology. The classic theories of nerve conduction do not fully explain how information is read and transmitted during the acupuncture treatment. Other theories have been proposed, but they are based on concepts such as biophotonic waves and quantum biochemistry that are difficult to read and understand by those who do not have knowledge in physics. It is the main objective of this review to provide a summary of the main theories and explanatory approaches to the signal transduction and conduction in acupuncture and to describe them in terms of their explanatory hypotheses, limitations, and weaknesses. The most of the literature found support theories for neural conduction, including gate control. They explain the effects of acupuncture in pain relief; few studies have been conducted concerning the conduction based on biophotons. The primo vascular system has been referred as a possible anatomic support for conduction of information during an acupuncture treatment, which could be connected to biophoton transmission. "
"The objective of this study was to evaluate if a single session of real or placebo cupping therapy in patients with chronic low back pain would be enough to temporarily reduce pain intensity and functional disability, enhancing their mechanical threshold and reducing local skin temperature. The outcome measures pain intensity using Brief Pain Inventory, pressure pain threshold, disability using the Roland Morris disability questionnaire, and low back skin temperature were assessed. This is an experimental clinical trial; after examination (AV0), patients were submitted to real or placebo cupping therapy (15 minutes, bilaterally at the points BL23 (Shenshu), BL24 (Qihaishu), and BL25 (Dachangshu) and were revaluated immediately after the session (AV1) and after one week (AV2). The patients showed a significant improvement in all pain severity items and sleep in the Brief Pain Inventory and a decrease in disability in the Roland Morris disability questionnaire. No significant differences were found in pressure pain threshold or skin temperature. No significant differences were found in any outcome of the placebo cupping therapy group. Thus, the cupping therapy is effective in reducing low back pain and decreasing disability after one single session but not change skin mechanical threshold or temperature. "
"Many functional diseases are related to dysautonomia, and heart rate variability has been used to assess dysautonomia. However, heart rate variability has not been studied in Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome (SQDS). Healthy volunteers (n = 37) and patients with SQDS (n = 67), recruited from the Clinic of the State University of Ecatepec Valley were included in the study. Outcome measures were average heart rate, standard deviation of the normal-to-normal heartbeat intervals, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) power, and the LF/HF ratio. Also, intestinal peristalsis, gastrointestinal symptoms (GSs), fatigue, and level of attention were measured. Standard deviation of the normal-to-normal heartbeat intervals (17 ± 2.3%) and HF (14 ± 3.1%) were lower in SQDS patients (17 ± 1.3%) than in healthy volunteers. SQDS patients had higher heart rate, LF power, LF/HF ratio, and fatigue scores (9.6 ± 1.12%, 16 ± 2.1%, 22 ± 3.8%, and 21 ± 4.1%). The fatigue correlated positively with the LF/HF ratio and negatively with HF power. The SQDS group had lower concentration performance (16.2 ± 1.9%) in the d2 test. The intestinal peristalsis showed a reduction (15 ± 1.3%) as compared with control. GS score and peristalsis correlated negatively with HF. Our results suggest that the pathology of SDQS could be associated with a low vagal tone which causes a decrease in peristalsis, increased fatigue, reduced attention, and appearance of GSs. "
"The aim of this study was to assess whether the effectiveness of acupuncture is similar to the use of analgesics in the management of toothache. The research included 56 volunteers who were divided into 4 groups: Real Acupuncture group, Placebo Acupuncture group, Real Dipyrone group, and Placebo Dipyrone group. The interventions of the study were performed before the dental care. Inclusion criteria were toothache of pulpal origin with pain scale (Visual Analogue Scale) above 4, absence of medication for the pain, and aged over 18 years. The Real Acupuncture volunteers received a session of acupuncture using piercing needles, while volunteers from the Placebo Acupuncture group received an acupuncture session using non-piercing sham needles. Volunteers from the Real Dipyrone group received a dipyrone tablet and the Placebo Acupuncture group received a tablet with no active ingredient. Before any therapeutic intervention, we collected samples from the volunteers’ saliva to analyze the salivary cortisol, the volunteers rated the intensity of their pain using VAS, and we measured their energy level by the Ryodoraku method. After 20 minutes of treatment, all the volunteers’ analysis parameters were collected again. The Real Acupuncture group presented a greater reduction of VAS than the reduction obtained by the Real Dipyrone group (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for the salivary cortisol and energy level variables. It can be concluded that acupuncture was more effective in reducing odontalgia than the dipyrone and that it can be an alternative for odontalgia management. "
"Diseases of the stifle joint remain a challenge for veterinarians. The objective of this study was to achieve a valuable acupuncture suggestive diagnosis to be considered for stifle joint diseases in horses. Thirty-nine nonlame horses involved in different activities were assessed. Acupuncture was independently performed by two evaluators. Reactions of the animal when pressurizing the point suggestive of stifle disease (PSSD), Bladder-20 and/or Bladder-21, were considered as the inclusion criteria for inclusion in the stifle group (SG, n = 31), and the animals with no reactions were assigned to the control group (n = 8). Radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations were performed and evaluated by two independent professionals blinded to the group allocation. Thermographic examination of the PSSD and stifles was also performed, after acclimatization. The ultrasound scores and radiographic findings were higher in the SG than in the control group. Thermography evidenced increased temperature in the PSSD and stifles in the SG. The minimum acupuncture diagnostic criteria for stifle joint disease had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 57.0%, and the addition of the acupoints Gallbladder–dorsal tuber coxae, Gallbladder-27, and Spleen-13 to the minimum diagnostic criteria improved sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, assessing the reaction at the demonstrated acupoints can facilitate a diagnosis of a potential stifle lesion. dorsal tuber coxae dorsal tuber coxae "
"Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for tinnitus. However, no relevant studies of the exact mechanism of acupuncture efficacy on tinnitus have been published. Enrolled participants with left-sided tinnitus received acupuncture treatment at TE3 and TE5. The acupuncture session lasted for 30 minutes. The infrared thermography (IRT) test of each participant's bilateral aural regions and visual analog scale scores were taken before and after the first acupuncture treatment session. Fifty-four participants accepted acupuncture treatment and the IRT test. The temperature differentials of both sides were reduced significantly, but the maximum, minimum, and average temperature of bilateral aural regions did not have a significant difference before and after acupuncture session. The acupuncture's effects for tinnitus were associated with the improvement of cochlear blood flow via the IRT test. We have planned a full-scale randomized controlled trial to find out more about the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture for tinnitus. "
"Fatigue is the commonest symptom in cancer patients; despite high levels of clinically significant persistent cancer-related fatigue, few treatments are currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of acupressure on fatigue in patients with cancer who underwent chemotherapy. The study was designed as a randomized and controlled trial. Ninety samples were selected using the convenience sampling method, and random block sampling was used for allocation of groups (30 for each group). The three groups were similar by age and gender. The experimental group underwent acupressure at the Zusanli (ST-36), Hegu (LI-4), and Sanyingjiao (SP-6), whereas sham pressure was used in the placebo group and no intervention was applied in the control group; the level of fatigue of participants in three groups was calculated in three phases, before, during, and after chemotherapy. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22. The results showed that the mean of visual analog score of fatigue is significantly different in three groups at the end of chemotherapy (p = 0.021). The mean visual analog score of fatigue in the acupressure group was meaningfully lower than that in the control group after chemotherapy (p = 0.028). Results of this investigation showed that acupressure has short-term effectiveness on the cancer-related fatigue of patients undergoing chemotherapy."
"Twenty-five Thoroughbred jumper geldings suffered back soreness with poor performance, and 5 control horses were assessed by archived computer data, clinical examination, and laboratory analyses of complete blood picture, serum enzymes, and cortisol level, before and after cloprostenol-pharmacopuncture. The 25 diseased horses before therapy showed significant increases in aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase with clinical pains scored mild in 15 horses, moderate in 9 horses, and severe in one horse, without changes in the hormonal and hematological data. After therapy, they responded by an increase of heart rate (57.8 ± 4.3 bpm), body temperature (38.5 ± 0.7°C), respiration rate (28.3 ± 2.1 bpm), and capillary refilling time (CRT) (1.0 ± 0.0). On the 2nd day, a significant decrease in the mean levels of aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase (P = 0.001) was detected, while on the 4th day, they mimed the level of the 5 controls, and on the 6th day, they showed a significant decrease (P = 0.002). The serum cortisol level showed a significant increase on the 6th day of treatment (P = 0.013). The blood picture showed significant increases in red blood cells, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, white blood cells, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, lymphocytes, plateletcrit, and large platelet concentration ratio (P < 0.05) and nonsignificant changes in hematocrit, granulocytes, and midocytes. The improved blood parameters, enzymes, hormones, and performance progress after cloprostenol-pharmacopuncture proved its effectiveness in treating back soreness in athletic horses."
"To evaluate the feasibility of comparing the effect of the traditional Hijamah and the Asian wet cupping techniques in the management of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), a randomized clinical trial comparing traditional and Asian wet cupping techniques for CLBP was conducted in two secondary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Seventy eligible participants with CLBP were randomized to receive one session of wet cupping using either Asian technique (34 patients) or traditional Hijamah technique (36 patients). Cupping was performed at four sites of the bilateral bladder meridian (BL23, BL24, and BL25). The numeric rating scale, Present Pain Intensity, and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores were measured immediately after intervention, at seven days, and 14 days after intervention. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in the numeric rating scale, Present Pain Intensity, and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores, immediately after intervention, at seven days, and 14 days after intervention. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups across all the outcome measures up to 14 days after intervention. The study did not show a superiority of one technique compared with the other. Longer follow-up periods and more than one cupping session may be needed to evaluate the difference, if any, between both the techniques. Trial Registration NCT02012205. "
"The increased resting heart rate (HR) in heart transplant patients is associated with enhanced metabolic demand, the potential for fatigue, and lower quality of life. In the present study, we hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) could modulate autonomic balance and reduce resting HR in these patients. A single-arm clinical trial was conducted with patients aged > 18 years, at ambulatorial accompaniment after heart transplantation, who were submitted to a single TEAS (40 minutes at pericardium channel acupoints PC5 and PC6). The arterial blood pressure and RR interval were recorded from 20 minutes before to 20 minutes after TEAS. The RR intervals were used to calculate HR variability (HRV) and the sympathovagal index. Linear mixed models were used for comparing variables before, during, and after TEAS. The significance level was set as P < 0.05. TEAS acutely improved HRV in transplant patients and enhanced the sympathovagal index during its application. Significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were observed at recovery, such as a slight, but significant, decrease in HR. In conclusion, TEAS at PC5 and PC6 acutely modulates HRV and hemodynamics in transplant patients. "
"Acupuncture and the administration of herbal supplements are increasingly used in veterinary practice, but no retrospective studies have examined patient characteristics and treatment interventions in a population of dogs and cats presenting exclusively for such therapies. This two-year retrospective analysis of 161 referrals to an integrative medicine service at an academic teaching hospital found that dogs were more frequently treated than cats (91.9% vs. 8.1%, respectively) and that small animal patients most frequently were presented for musculoskeletal (26.7%), neurologic (16.8%), oncologic (14.9%), and dermatologic (10.6%) conditions. Cats were older than treated dogs (12.7 ± 3.7 vs. 9.5 ± 4.3 years) and more likely to be treated for oncologic complaints (odds ratio = 5.6). Patients received acupuncture (95.4%), herbal supplements (76.4%), acupuncture with percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (electroacupuncture, 26.1%), and/or cyanocobalamin injections in acupuncture points (pharmacopuncture, 23.6%). Some differences were detected between treatment groups. This retrospective analysis provides a foundation for designing future prospective studies using acupuncture and herbs in dogs and cats. "
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of scalp acupuncture and electrostimulation, combined or not, in a disuse model consisted of early sensorimotor restriction in rats. Male Wistar pups received sensorimotor restriction from the second postnatal day (P2) until P28. Animals were divided into five different groups (n = 6): control (CT), sensorimotor restricted (SR), acupuncture (AC), electrostimulation (EL), and electroacupuncture (AC+EL). Experimental animals received sham, acupuncture, or electrical stimulation, combined or not, of two scalp regions for 7 days (P29-P35). Before treatment period (P29) and after treatment (P36), animals were evaluated with the narrow suspended bar, horizontal ladder, and stride length tests. SR animals had worse performance in the narrow suspended and horizontal ladder tasks compared with SR animals at P29 (p ≤ 0.005). Significant improvements were observed in both tasks in AC, EL, and EL+AC groups comparing P29 and P36 (p < 0.001). Also, at P35, all treated animals performed significantly better motor tasks compared with SR group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between treated groups. Finally, acupuncture and electrical stimulation, combined or not, have beneficial effect on motor performance following early developmental disuse. p p p p p p "
"This study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for the treatment Bell’s palsy sequelae. In this study, forty patients with Bell’s palsy sequelae were randomly allocated to either the acupuncture or the control group. The clinical outcomes before and after treatment were assessed using the following assays: the facial nerve compound motor action potential and HouseeBrackmann (HB) and Sunnybrook (SB) grading scales. Agreement analysis was performed between the SB and HB grading scales. There was significant difference between pretreatment and posttreatment compound motor action potential values of the patients within the acupuncture group (p = 0.036). In pretreatment and posttreatment SB and HB scores, significant differences within the two groups were observed. However, the significance level in the improvement rate in the acupuncture group was higher than that of the control group. General agreement between the SB and HB scores of groups was an acceptable value, and weighted agreement between the scales was a moderate agreement. In this study, we found that acupuncture treatment is effective in improving Bell’s palsy sequelae. Acupuncture can be used as a safe method in the treatment of Bell’s palsy sequelae. "
"The primo vascular system (PVS) is a very important topic of study nowadays because of their role in transport and regeneration of tissue and in cell migration and cancer metastasis. The PVS was detected in different organs of the rabbit but not in the placenta. In this work, we observe the PVS inside the blood vessels of the placenta for the first time. The main characteristic features of the primo vessels (PVs) from the rabbit placenta were in agreement with the PVS in different organs of animals, including the rod-shaped nuclei and their arrangement. "
"For the connectome of primo vascular system, some long-type primo vessels dyed with Alcian blue injected into inguinal nodes, abdominal node, and axially nodes were visualized, which passed over around the vena cava of the rabbit. The Alcian blue dye revealed primo vessels and colored blue in the rabbit lymph vessels. The length of long-type primo vessels was 18 cm on average, of which diameters were about 20–30 μm, and the lymph vessels had diameters of 100–150 μm. Three different tissues of pure primo vessel, mixed primo + lymph vessel, and only lymph vessel were made to undergo RNA-Seq analysis by next-generation sequencing. We also analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the RNA-Seq data, in which 30 genes of the primo vessels, primo + lymph vessels, and lymph vessels were selected for primo marker candidates. From the plot of DEG analysis, 10 genes had remarkably different expression pattern on the Group 1 (primo vessel) vs Group 3 (lymph vessel). With Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million the cutoff p-value for each gene was < 0.05. Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million of the 10 genes such as IGHM, HLA-DRA, HIST1H41, LPL, CD36, SRGN, DGAT2, SNCG, CD48, and GPD1 for primo vessels compared with those of lymph vessels increased twice or thrice. These results suggest that the selected genes could be used for the specific marker to construct primo connectome of circuit system in the rabbit. "
"Glaucoma patients can show blood flow anomalies at the eye vessels’ level. A causal relationship is reasonably expected, but, so far, it has not been demonstrated. Traditional Chinese Medicine indicates that acupuncture can promote specific blood perfusion in specific body districts. Ninety-eight patients with open-angle glaucoma were treated with an ultralow light-level laser, according to a specific acupuncture protocol, and their blood flow was measured before and after a 6-week treatment cycle. Doppler measurements showed significant modifications in both pulsatility and resistivity indexes. The most relevant outcome of this study is that the applied treatment demonstrated its effectiveness not only in vasodilation but also in the perfusion control that seems to restore appropriate functionality. The protocol can therefore be applied in this and perhaps in other blood perfusion–related pathologies. "
"A number of studies have examined the accuracy and precision of acupuncture point location across various point location methods. Accuracy of point location is essential for safe, efficacious and reliable treatments and valid reproducible research outcomes. This review aims to identify, summarize, compare and critically appraise available empirical studies relating to the accuracy and precision of acupuncture point location. A comprehensive search of five electronic databases, World Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Google scholar was performed for studies investigating accuracy and precision in acupuncture point location. 771 studies were screened of which 14 studies were identified, including 9 studies that investigated the localization of acupoints and 5 studies that examined the cun measurement system. Considerable variation in localization of acupoints was reported among qualified medical acupuncturists. Variation in point location among qualified non-medical acupuncturists is unknown due to lack of any identified study. The directional method was found to be significantly inaccurate and imprecise in all studies that evaluated the method. Suitability of other methods for clinical and research purposes and influencing factors such as education, training and experience were identified as topics for future studies. "
"Aim The aim of this study was to investigate effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) and manual acupuncture (MA) on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back.

The primary outcomes measurements were intensity pain (NRS) and disability (RMQ). All main analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. Results The groups reported improvements posttreatment in intensity pain and disability respectively; however, no differences between groups were observed. Regarding the secondary outcomes, we observed a between-group difference only for kinesiophobia in favor of the manual acupuncture group (difference = −4.1 points, 95% CI = −7.0 to −1.1). The results were maintained after 3 months of follow-up. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, EA did not result in a better outcome compared with MA treatment. Conclusion The study does not provide evidence that an electroacupuncture is superior to acupuncture treatment. Both therapies had similar efficacy in reducing pain and disability for chronic nonspecific low back pain. "

Sharp and blunt sensations were associated with the real and sham needles, respectively, for both conditions. This study confirmed that tactile cues were the main sensory modalities used in participant decision-making during acupuncture administration. Also, short-term blindfolding of participants during procedures will unlikely influence blinding effectiveness. Clinical trial registration number Not applicable. This study does not fall under the definition of a clinical trial under the ICMJE guidelines. "
"This study evaluates the effects of a short-term Cardio Tai Chi program on the cardiorespiratory fitness and hemodynamic parameters in sedentary adults. Thirty-one sedentary participants (age: 58 ± 9 years, body mass: 63 ± 12 kg) were subjected to an exercise program during 10 sessions over a 10-day period within 2 weeks. The Cardio Tai Chi program consisted in a series of three to five intervals lasting 90 s each at ∼70% maximal heart rate separated by 2-min of low-intensity recovery. Primary outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake, V˙O2peak) assessed by the Rockport walking test and resting hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures). We observed a significant difference of means on post-pre V˙O2peak [4.5 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1 to 5.8, p = 0.004], systolic blood pressure (-5.5 mmHg, 95% CI:-7.3 to -3.8, p = 0.010) and pulse pressure (-3.7 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.2 to -2.3, p = 0.028). No significant differences were observed for diastolic pressure (−1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.6 to -1.0, p = 0.226), mean blood pressure (2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.6, p = 0.302), or resting heart rate (-0.9 beat/min, 95% CI: -2.0 to 0.1, p = 0.631). Our findings suggest that engaging in a short-term Cardio Tai Chi program can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and hemodynamic parameters in sedentary adults.  "
"Acupuncture is one of the areas among the alternative therapies that arise high curiosity in the biomedical scientific community. It is particularly popular for treatment of chronic diseases and addictions. However, contrasting with its evidence-based effectiveness, the lack of reasonable explanations for its mode of action divides that scientific community. Difficulties also arise to those responsible for providing information for clinicians and professionals who wish to acquire competencies leading to the acupuncture practice and have a background based on biochemistry and physiology. The classic theories of nerve conduction do not fully explain how information is read and transmitted during the acupuncture treatment. Other theories have been proposed, but they are based on concepts such as biophotonic waves and quantum biochemistry that are difficult to read and understand by those who do not have knowledge in physics. It is the main objective of this review to provide a summary of the main theories and explanatory approaches to the signal transduction and conduction in acupuncture and to describe them in terms of their explanatory hypotheses, limitations, and weaknesses. The most of the literature found support theories for neural conduction, including gate control. They explain the effects of acupuncture in pain relief; few studies have been conducted concerning the conduction based on biophotons. The primo vascular system has been referred as a possible anatomic support for conduction of information during an acupuncture treatment, which could be connected to biophoton transmission. "
"The objective of this study was to evaluate if a single session of real or placebo cupping therapy in patients with chronic low back pain would be enough to temporarily reduce pain intensity and functional disability, enhancing their mechanical threshold and reducing local skin temperature. The outcome measures pain intensity using Brief Pain Inventory, pressure pain threshold, disability using the Roland Morris disability questionnaire, and low back skin temperature were assessed. This is an experimental clinical trial; after examination (AV0), patients were submitted to real or placebo cupping therapy (15 minutes, bilaterally at the points BL23 (Shenshu), BL24 (Qihaishu), and BL25 (Dachangshu) and were revaluated immediately after the session (AV1) and after one week (AV2). The patients showed a significant improvement in all pain severity items and sleep in the Brief Pain Inventory and a decrease in disability in the Roland Morris disability questionnaire. No significant differences were found in pressure pain threshold or skin temperature. No significant differences were found in any outcome of the placebo cupping therapy group. Thus, the cupping therapy is effective in reducing low back pain and decreasing disability after one single session but not change skin mechanical threshold or temperature. "
"The primo vascular system (PVS) is reported to have a periductium composed of cells with spherical or spindle-shaped nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. However, little is known about these periductium cells. In this study, we examined the morphological features of cells covering the PVS tissue isolated from the surface of abdominal organs of rats. By hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, we observed a layer of dark nuclei on the basement membrane at the borders of the sections of primo node (PN), primo vessel (PV), and their subunits. The nuclei appeared thin and linear (10-14 μm), elliptical (8-10 × 3-4 μm), and round (5-7 μm). The borders of the PVS tissue sections were immunostained with a selective antibody for mesothelial cells (MCs). Areas of immunoreactivity overlapped with the flattened cells are shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining. By scanning electron microscopy, we further identified elliptical (11 × 21 μm) and rectangular squamous MCs (length, 10 μm). There were numerous stomata (∼200 nm) and microparticles (20-200 nm) on the surface of the PVS MCs. In conclusion, this study presents the novel finding that the PVS periductium is composed of squamous MCs. These cells tightly line the luminal surface of the PVS tissue, including PNs, PVs, and small branches of the PVs in the abdominal cavity. These results will help us to understand the physiological roles such as hyaluronan secretion and the fine structure of PVS tissue. "
"Melissa officinalis (MO) is one of the oldest herbal medicines commonly used in traditional medicine, which some studies have investigated for its analgesic effect. This study is an attempt to investigate the effects of intrathecal administration of Melissa officinalis on the pain induced by heat and formalin. Melissa officinalis Melissa officinalis In this experimental study, 70 male Wistar rats with an average weight of 270-320 g were randomly divided into five groups: control; sham that received 25 μl of saline through the spinal catheter; and three experimental groups that received 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg M. officinalis via the spinal catheter respectively. Five days after catheterization of the spinal cord from the lumbar region under anesthesia, the effects of Intrathecal administration of M. officinalis on heat- and formalin-induced pain were evaluated. Data were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA. Intrathecal injection of M. officinalis blocked heat-induced pain compared to sham group (p = 0.001). Maximum analgesia was observed 30 min after the injection. Furthermore, intrathecal administration of MO alleviated both acute (p = 0.007) and chronic (p = 0.001) phases of formalin-induced pain. Motor block was not observed in any of the above mentioned groups. The results showed that intrathecal administration of MO could significantly improve hot-water and formalin-induced pain in male Wistar rats.

"The aim of this study was to assess whether the effectiveness of acupuncture is similar to the use of analgesics in the management of toothache. The research included 56 volunteers who were divided into 4 groups: Real Acupuncture group, Placebo Acupuncture group, Real Dipyrone group, and Placebo Dipyrone group. The interventions of the study were performed before the dental care. Inclusion criteria were toothache of pulpal origin with pain scale (Visual Analogue Scale) above 4, absence of medication for the pain, and aged over 18 years. The Real Acupuncture volunteers received a session of acupuncture using piercing needles, while volunteers from the Placebo Acupuncture group received an acupuncture session using non-piercing sham needles. Volunteers from the Real Dipyrone group received a dipyrone tablet and the Placebo Acupuncture group received a tablet with no active ingredient. Before any therapeutic intervention, we collected samples from the volunteers’ saliva to analyze the salivary cortisol, the volunteers rated the intensity of their pain using VAS, and we measured their energy level by the Ryodoraku method. After 20 minutes of treatment, all the volunteers’ analysis parameters were collected again. The Real Acupuncture group presented a greater reduction of VAS than the reduction obtained by the Real Dipyrone group (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for the salivary cortisol and energy level variables. It can be concluded that acupuncture was more effective in reducing odontalgia than the dipyrone and that it can be an alternative for odontalgia management. "
"Many functional diseases are related to dysautonomia, and heart rate variability has been used to assess dysautonomia. However, heart rate variability has not been studied in Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome (SQDS). Healthy volunteers (n = 37) and patients with SQDS (n = 67), recruited from the Clinic of the State University of Ecatepec Valley were included in the study. Outcome measures were average heart rate, standard deviation of the normal-to-normal heartbeat intervals, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) power, and the LF/HF ratio. Also, intestinal peristalsis, gastrointestinal symptoms (GSs), fatigue, and level of attention were measured. Standard deviation of the normal-to-normal heartbeat intervals (17 ± 2.3%) and HF (14 ± 3.1%) were lower in SQDS patients (17 ± 1.3%) than in healthy volunteers. SQDS patients had higher heart rate, LF power, LF/HF ratio, and fatigue scores (9.6 ± 1.12%, 16 ± 2.1%, 22 ± 3.8%, and 21 ± 4.1%). The fatigue correlated positively with the LF/HF ratio and negatively with HF power. The SQDS group had lower concentration performance (16.2 ± 1.9%) in the d2 test. The intestinal peristalsis showed a reduction (15 ± 1.3%) as compared with control. GS score and peristalsis correlated negatively with HF. Our results suggest that the pathology of SDQS could be associated with a low vagal tone which causes a decrease in peristalsis, increased fatigue, reduced attention, and appearance of GSs. "
"Fatigue is the commonest symptom in cancer patients; despite high levels of clinically significant persistent cancer-related fatigue, few treatments are currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of acupressure on fatigue in patients with cancer who underwent chemotherapy. The study was designed as a randomized and controlled trial. Ninety samples were selected using the convenience sampling method, and random block sampling was used for allocation of groups (30 for each group). The three groups were similar by age and gender. The experimental group underwent acupressure at the Zusanli (ST-36), Hegu (LI-4), and Sanyingjiao (SP-6), whereas sham pressure was used in the placebo group and no intervention was applied in the control group; the level of fatigue of participants in three groups was calculated in three phases, before, during, and after chemotherapy. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22. The results showed that the mean of visual analog score of fatigue is significantly different in three groups at the end of chemotherapy (p = 0.021). The mean visual analog score of fatigue in the acupressure group was meaningfully lower than that in the control group after chemotherapy (p = 0.028). Results of this investigation showed that acupressure has short-term effectiveness on the cancer-related fatigue of patients undergoing chemotherapy. p p p p "
"Twenty-five Thoroughbred jumper geldings suffered back soreness with poor performance, and 5 control horses were assessed by archived computer data, clinical examination, and laboratory analyses of complete blood picture, serum enzymes, and cortisol level, before and after cloprostenol-pharmacopuncture. The 25 diseased horses before therapy showed significant increases in aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase with clinical pains scored mild in 15 horses, moderate in 9 horses, and severe in one horse, without changes in the hormonal and hematological data. After therapy, they responded by an increase of heart rate (57.8 ± 4.3 bpm), body temperature (38.5 ± 0.7°C), respiration rate (28.3 ± 2.1 bpm), and capillary refilling time (CRT) (1.0 ± 0.0). On the 2nd day, a significant decrease in the mean levels of aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase (P = 0.001) was detected, while on the 4th day, they mimed the level of the 5 controls, and on the 6th day, they showed a significant decrease (P = 0.002). The serum cortisol level showed a significant increase on the 6th day of treatment (P = 0.013). The blood picture showed significant increases in red blood cells, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, white blood cells, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, lymphocytes, plateletcrit, and large platelet concentration ratio (P < 0.05) and nonsignificant changes in hematocrit, granulocytes, and midocytes. The improved blood parameters, enzymes, hormones, and performance progress after cloprostenol-pharmacopuncture proved its effectiveness in treating back soreness in athletic horses. nd th th th nd th th th "
"Diseases of the stifle joint remain a challenge for veterinarians. The objective of this study was to achieve a valuable acupuncture suggestive diagnosis to be considered for stifle joint diseases in horses. Thirty-nine nonlame horses involved in different activities were assessed. Acupuncture was independently performed by two evaluators. Reactions of the animal when pressurizing the point suggestive of stifle disease (PSSD), Bladder-20 and/or Bladder-21, were considered as the inclusion criteria for inclusion in the stifle group (SG, n = 31), and the animals with no reactions were assigned to the control group (n = 8). Radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations were performed and evaluated by two independent professionals blinded to the group allocation. Thermographic examination of the PSSD and stifles was also performed, after acclimatization. The ultrasound scores and radiographic findings were higher in the SG than in the control group. Thermography evidenced increased temperature in the PSSD and stifles in the SG. The minimum acupuncture diagnostic criteria for stifle joint disease had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 57.0%, and the addition of the acupoints Gallbladder–dorsal tuber coxae, Gallbladder-27, and Spleen-13 to the minimum diagnostic criteria improved sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, assessing the reaction at the demonstrated acupoints can facilitate a diagnosis of a potential stifle lesion. dorsal tuber coxae dorsal tuber coxae "
"Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for tinnitus. However, no relevant studies of the exact mechanism of acupuncture efficacy on tinnitus have been published. Enrolled participants with left-sided tinnitus received acupuncture treatment at TE3 and TE5. The acupuncture session lasted for 30 minutes. The infrared thermography (IRT) test of each participant's bilateral aural regions and visual analog scale scores were taken before and after the first acupuncture treatment session. Fifty-four participants accepted acupuncture treatment and the IRT test. The temperature differentials of both sides were reduced significantly, but the maximum, minimum, and average temperature of bilateral aural regions did not have a significant difference before and after acupuncture session. The acupuncture's effects for tinnitus were associated with the improvement of cochlear blood flow via the IRT test. We have planned a full-scale randomized controlled trial to find out more about the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture for tinnitus. "
"To evaluate the feasibility of comparing the effect of the traditional Hijamah and the Asian wet cupping techniques in the management of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), a randomized clinical trial comparing traditional and Asian wet cupping techniques for CLBP was conducted in two secondary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Seventy eligible participants with CLBP were randomized to receive one session of wet cupping using either Asian technique (34 patients) or traditional Hijamah technique (36 patients). Cupping was performed at four sites of the bilateral bladder meridian (BL23, BL24, and BL25). The numeric rating scale, Present Pain Intensity, and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores were measured immediately after intervention, at seven days, and 14 days after intervention. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in the numeric rating scale, Present Pain Intensity, and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire scores, immediately after intervention, at seven days, and 14 days after intervention. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups across all the outcome measures up to 14 days after intervention. The study did not show a superiority of one technique compared with the other. Longer follow-up periods and more than one cupping session may be needed to evaluate the difference, if any, between both the techniques. Trial Registration NCT02012205. "
"Acupuncture and the administration of herbal supplements are increasingly used in veterinary practice, but no retrospective studies have examined patient characteristics and treatment interventions in a population of dogs and cats presenting exclusively for such therapies. This two-year retrospective analysis of 161 referrals to an integrative medicine service at an academic teaching hospital found that dogs were more frequently treated than cats (91.9% vs. 8.1%, respectively) and that small animal patients most frequently were presented for musculoskeletal (26.7%), neurologic (16.8%), oncologic (14.9%), and dermatologic (10.6%) conditions. Cats were older than treated dogs (12.7 ± 3.7 vs. 9.5 ± 4.3 years) and more likely to be treated for oncologic complaints (odds ratio = 5.6). Patients received acupuncture (95.4%), herbal supplements (76.4%), acupuncture with percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (electroacupuncture, 26.1%), and/or cyanocobalamin injections in acupuncture points (pharmacopuncture, 23.6%). Some differences were detected between treatment groups. This retrospective analysis provides a foundation for designing future prospective studies using acupuncture and herbs in dogs and cats. "
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of scalp acupuncture and electrostimulation, combined or not, in a disuse model consisted of early sensorimotor restriction in rats. Male Wistar pups received sensorimotor restriction from the second postnatal day (P2) until P28. Animals were divided into five different groups (n = 6): control (CT), sensorimotor restricted (SR), acupuncture (AC), electrostimulation (EL), and electroacupuncture (AC+EL). Experimental animals received sham, acupuncture, or electrical stimulation, combined or not, of two scalp regions for 7 days (P29-P35). Before treatment period (P29) and after treatment (P36), animals were evaluated with the narrow suspended bar, horizontal ladder, and stride length tests. SR animals had worse performance in the narrow suspended and horizontal ladder tasks compared with SR animals at P29 (p ≤ 0.005). Significant improvements were observed in both tasks in AC, EL, and EL+AC groups comparing P29 and P36 (p < 0.001). Also, at P35, all treated animals performed significantly better motor tasks compared with SR group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between treated groups. Finally, acupuncture and electrical stimulation, combined or not, have beneficial effect on motor performance following early developmental disuse."
"The increased resting heart rate (HR) in heart transplant patients is associated with enhanced metabolic demand, the potential for fatigue, and lower quality of life. In the present study, we hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) could modulate autonomic balance and reduce resting HR in these patients. A single-arm clinical trial was conducted with patients aged > 18 years, at ambulatorial accompaniment after heart transplantation, who were submitted to a single TEAS (40 minutes at pericardium channel acupoints PC5 and PC6). The arterial blood pressure and RR interval were recorded from 20 minutes before to 20 minutes after TEAS. The RR intervals were used to calculate HR variability (HRV) and the sympathovagal index. Linear mixed models were used for comparing variables before, during, and after TEAS. The significance level was set as P < 0.05. TEAS acutely improved HRV in transplant patients and enhanced the sympathovagal index during its application. Significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were observed at recovery, such as a slight, but significant, decrease in HR. In conclusion, TEAS at PC5 and PC6 acutely modulates HRV and hemodynamics in transplant patients. "
"This study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for the treatment Bell’s palsy sequelae. In this study, forty patients with Bell’s palsy sequelae were randomly allocated to either the acupuncture or the control group. The clinical outcomes before and after treatment were assessed using the following assays: the facial nerve compound motor action potential and HouseeBrackmann (HB) and Sunnybrook (SB) grading scales. Agreement analysis was performed between the SB and HB grading scales. There was significant difference between pretreatment and posttreatment compound motor action potential values of the patients within the acupuncture group (p = 0.036). In pretreatment and posttreatment SB and HB scores, significant differences within the two groups were observed. However, the significance level in the improvement rate in the acupuncture group was higher than that of the control group. General agreement between the SB and HB scores of groups was an acceptable value, and weighted agreement between the scales was a moderate agreement. In this study, we found that acupuncture treatment is effective in improving Bell’s palsy sequelae. Acupuncture can be used as a safe method in the treatment of Bell’s palsy sequelae. p p "
"The primo vascular system (PVS) is a very important topic of study nowadays because of their role in transport and regeneration of tissue and in cell migration and cancer metastasis. The PVS was detected in different organs of the rabbit but not in the placenta. In this work, we observe the PVS inside the blood vessels of the placenta for the first time. The main characteristic features of the primo vessels (PVs) from the rabbit placenta were in agreement with the PVS in different organs of animals, including the rod-shaped nuclei and their arrangement.

"Glaucoma patients can show blood flow anomalies at the eye vessels’ level. A causal relationship is reasonably expected, but, so far, it has not been demonstrated. Traditional Chinese Medicine indicates that acupuncture can promote specific blood perfusion in specific body districts. Ninety-eight patients with open-angle glaucoma were treated with an ultralow light-level laser, according to a specific acupuncture protocol, and their blood flow was measured before and after a 6-week treatment cycle. Doppler measurements showed significant modifications in both pulsatility and resistivity indexes. The most relevant outcome of this study is that the applied treatment demonstrated its effectiveness not only in vasodilation but also in the perfusion control that seems to restore appropriate functionality. The protocol can therefore be applied in this and perhaps in other blood perfusion–related pathologies. "
"A number of studies have examined the accuracy and precision of acupuncture point location across various point location methods. Accuracy of point location is essential for safe, efficacious and reliable treatments and valid reproducible research outcomes. This review aims to identify, summarize, compare and critically appraise available empirical studies relating to the accuracy and precision of acupuncture point location. A comprehensive search of five electronic databases, World Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Google scholar was performed for studies investigating accuracy and precision in acupuncture point location. 771 studies were screened of which 14 studies were identified, including 9 studies that investigated the localization of acupoints and 5 studies that examined the cun measurement system. Considerable variation in localization of acupoints was reported among qualified medical acupuncturists. Variation in point location among qualified non-medical acupuncturists is unknown due to lack of any identified study. The directional method was found to be significantly inaccurate and imprecise in all studies that evaluated the method. Suitability of other methods for clinical and research purposes and influencing factors such as education, training and experience were identified as topics for future studies. "
"For the connectome of primo vascular system, some long-type primo vessels dyed with Alcian blue injected into inguinal nodes, abdominal node, and axially nodes were visualized, which passed over around the vena cava of the rabbit. The Alcian blue dye revealed primo vessels and colored blue in the rabbit lymph vessels. The length of long-type primo vessels was 18 cm on average, of which diameters were about 20–30 μm, and the lymph vessels had diameters of 100–150 μm. Three different tissues of pure primo vessel, mixed primo + lymph vessel, and only lymph vessel were made to undergo RNA-Seq analysis by next-generation sequencing. We also analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the RNA-Seq data, in which 30 genes of the primo vessels, primo + lymph vessels, and lymph vessels were selected for primo marker candidates. From the plot of DEG analysis, 10 genes had remarkably different expression pattern on the Group 1 (primo vessel) vs Group 3 (lymph vessel). With Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million the cutoff p-value for each gene was < 0.05. Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million of the 10 genes such as IGHM, HLA-DRA, HIST1H41, LPL, CD36, SRGN, DGAT2, SNCG, CD48, and GPD1 for primo vessels compared with those of lymph vessels increased twice or thrice. These results suggest that the selected genes could be used for the specific marker to construct primo connectome of circuit system in the rabbit. "
"Equine acupuncture and herbal medicine are increasingly popular and have been anecdotally used in the treatment of a number of conditions. There is, however, a lack of data on the most commonly treated conditions in horses. The medical records of 164 horses presented exclusively for acupuncture and herbal therapy over a three-year period from October 2012 to October 2015 were evaluated from a mixed animal integrative medicine service at a veterinary academic teaching hospital. Horses were presented primarily for musculoskeletal conditions (62.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (9.5%), and anhydrosis (6.1%). Nearly half of all treated horses were geldings, and the mean age of treatment was 10.7 ± 6.5 years. The most common breeds were Warmbloods (28.2%), Quarter horses (20.2%), Thoroughbreds (17.8%), and Arabians (8.0%). Treatments included acupuncture (90.2%), herbal supplements (79.8%), electroacupuncture (69.9%), B12 injections (pharmacoacupuncture, 29.4%), or administration of autologous blood at acupuncture points (hemoacupuncture, 8.0%). Thirty-eight (38) different herbal formulas were recommended during the study period. Horses that were not provided herbal recommendations were more likely to present with gastrointestinal complaints (odds ratio = 11.2). Sex, breed, and presenting complaint had no or minimal impact on the types of treatments performed during the visit. However, data regarding patient characteristics and presenting complaints provide novel information which can be used to design prospective clinical trials. "
"Auriculotherapy has been extensively used for chronic spontaneous urticaria in China. However, the evidence of its effectiveness and safety for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria is insufficient. Hence, we conducted this study to compare auriculotherapy or auriculotherapy joint treatment with Western medicine for the cure of chronic spontaneous urticaria. This meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials showed that auriculotherapy or auriculotherapy joint treatment was significantly superior to Western medicine in curing clinical signs and symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria [odds ration (OR), 2.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54–4.43; p = 0.0004) and also better in total effect rate (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.07–7.01; p＜0.0001). But, auriculotherapy or auriculotherapy joint treatment was similar to Western medicine in improving clinical signs and symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.35–1.56; p = 0.42). Auriculotherapy or auriculotherapy joint treatment was safer than Western medicine for curing chronic spontaneous urticaria (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09–0.80; p = 0.02). Auriculotherapy alone or auriculotherapy joint treatment appears to be more effective and safer than Western medicine that contains antihistamines in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the unclear risk bias of methodological quality, and further studies with large-scale, better, and more rigorously designed protocol are necessary to prove these findings."
"This study describes the reliability of pragmatic combinations of acupuncture points for lateral epicondylalgia (LE) as prescribed by physiotherapists who were experts in acupuncture. Raters (n = 14; 33–59 years) independently prescribed acupuncture points for 30 simulated human patients with LE who were surveyed via a printed questionnaire. The frequency and cooccurrence of acupuncture points prescribed for patients with lateral epicondylitis were assessed. Absolute agreement and Light's kappa (κLight) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to quantify the interrater agreement. Raters prescribed 103 unique acupuncture points in different combinations with a median (min–max) of 5 (0–11) acupuncture points. The most prescribed acupuncture point was LI-11 (297 of 420; 71%), and the most common cooccurring acupuncture points were LI-11 and LI-4 (160 of 420; 38%). The absolute agreement for prescribing the acupuncture points ranged from 70% (point GB-20) to 0% (points LI-10, SP-6, LI-11, GB-34, LI-12, and LI-4). Point LR-3 showed the highest interrater reliability for prescribing the acupuncture points [κLight = 0.112, 95% CI = (0.055–0.194)], whereas point LI-4 showed the lowest reliability [κLight = −0.003, 95% CI = (−0.024 to 0.024)]. These findings suggest that pragmatic prescriptions of acupuncture points for LE are unreliable among physiotherapists who are experts in acupuncture. Explicit, high-level evidence-based rules for prescribing and teaching combinations of acupuncture points for LE are warranted. Light Light Light Light Light Light "
"Acupuncture, for the westerns countries, is an innovative and low-cost therapy for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, most of its effects and mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this work was to systematically review the literature regarding the clinical effects of acupuncture for the treatment and prevention of CVDs. A search for papers published in English or Portuguese in the past 20 years was conducted at PubMed, SciELO, and PEDro databases. Clinical trials conducted on the effects of acupuncture were included in this review. Two reviewers extracted the data independently from the remaining 17 articles after screening. The most used acupoint was PC6 (10 studies, 64.7%), followed by ST36 (6 studies, 35.3%) and auricular acupoints (4 studies, 23.5%). Among the clinical applications, hypertension was the most studied CVD, with acupuncture being the most reported method among the studies (70.6%). Only three articles reported no benefit in the treatment of CVDs for the methodology used. We conclude that although several studies indicated an improvement in the response of the cardiovascular system in CVDs by acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or electrostimulation treatment, the heterogeneity of the studies does not allow a standardization of its application for each specific disease, making further studies necessary for its use to become a reality.

"Objectives To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture as an auxiliary analgesic treatment for chronic headaches and the influence of this treatment on the quality of life, as the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic headache is still controversial. Methods Thirty-four patients selected from a University Hospital Clinic on Chronic Pain were divided into two groups: True acupuncture (Group 1), in which the recommended points of the Traditional Chinese Medicine were used for each type of headache and sham acupuncture (Group 2), in which the needles were inserted into a device (the stick-on moxa), at the same points as Group 1. Both groups used the prescribed preventive medication for pain. The verbal numeric scale before (VNS0) and after (VNS1) treatment, the number of crisis, and the number of analgesics used during the first and second months of treatment were used for assessment. Quality of life was also assessed before and after treatment with the Brazilian version of the Quality of Life Questionnaire: SF-6D, 2002. Results The true acupuncture group showed greater effectiveness in controlling pain in chronic headache, which was statistically significant in all domains compared to the sham acupuncture group, including quality of life. Conclusions Acupuncture can be considered an auxiliary treatment for chronic headache, reducing the intensity of pain, the number of crisis, the quantity of analgesics used, and improving the quality of life in patients with this painful condition.

"We present here a model of meridians in the formalism of the gauge theory paradigm of quantum field theory with spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. We discuss the origin and dynamic self-focusing propagation of the electromagnetic field in coherent states and the role it plays in our meridian modeling. Within this frame, we consider the formation of solitary waves on proteins and anatomical filamentary structures and discuss nondissipative energy transport. Finally, we analyze the relation of meridians with anatomical filamentary structures, the reciprocal actions between meridians, and biochemical activity and the key role played by free energy, internal energy, and entropy.

"The aim of this study was determining the effect of acupressure on the severity of pain associated with intramuscular injections of magnesium sulfate administered by the Z-track technique in patients with eclampsia and preeclampsia. Forty-eight patients participated in this single-group clinical trial, which was conducted in three stages. For each patient, three intramuscular injections were administered by the Z-track technique. The first injection was administered by the conventional method. The second injection at a sham control point and the third injection using acupressure (BL32) were administered. Pain severity was measured on a visual analogue scale. The mean pain intensity was 7.22 in the first, 4.75 in the second and 1.94 in the third injections (p < 0.001). The results of the study showed that acupressure at the BL32 point before intramuscular injection of magnesium sulfate significantly reduced the injection-related pain. "
"Background and objective Electrical stimulation and acupuncture points as nonpharmacological methods have been the focus of pain reduction in different patients. This study is aimed at determining the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the acupuncture points of pain in patients under mechanical ventilators. Materials and methods This randomized double-blind clinical trial study was conducted on 50 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care units of Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2017. The patients were randomly allocated into intervention and placebo groups. In the intervention group, TENS electrodes were placed on points Hegu and Zusanli. Pain severity was measured using the Care Pain Observation Tool scale, and the dosages of narcotics and sedation intake were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 19. Results The level of pain in patients decreased in the intervention group in comparison with the sham group, and this decline was significant during certain hours (p < 0.05). The amount of analgesic and sedation drugs used was less significant in the intervention group than in the sham group (p = 0.01; p = 0.04). Conclusion The results showed that the use of TENS on acupuncture points can decrease the level of pain and opioid consumption in intubated patients under a mechanical ventilator. "
"Anxiety is a common preoperative problem in cesarean section candidates. Nonpharmacologic anxiety control has been demonstrated to be more suitable in pregnant women. The current study was a randomized, single-blind clinical trial which evaluated the effect of acupressure on preoperative C-section anxiety. In this study, 60 patients facing surgery were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients each. Those patients in the intervention group received simultaneous acupressure at the Yintang and HE-7 acupoints for 5 minutes before surgery, and patients in the control group received intervention at a sham acupoint. The anxiety level of patients was preoperatively assessed twice using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The mean anxiety scores of the two groups were shown to be insignificantly different before the intervention (p = 0.859), whereas a significant difference between the mean anxiety scores of the two groups was observed after the intervention (p = 0.001), suggesting that acupressure reduced the anxiety of patients before surgery."
"Background and aim Heavy metals have been recognized as toxins for centuries. Cupping therapy has been shown to aid in the excretion of accumulated fluids and toxins from the interstitial fluid. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of wet cupping therapy on blood levels of heavy metals. Methods Thirteen healthy male individuals [mean age ± standard deviation, 28.47 ± 6.18] participated in this study. Venous blood samples were collected 5 min before and 30 days after the wet cupping therapy. Five points of the posterior neck and bilateral perispinal areas of the neck and thoracic spine were selected for cupping therapy. The levels of aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results The levels of heavy metals (Al, Zn, and Cd) after cupping therapy were significantly lower than the levels before therapy. Conclusions These results suggest that wet cupping therapy has an excretory effect on the kidney. Wet cupping therapy may clear blood from excess heavy metals. "
"The aim of this study was to evaluate Deqi in patients under treatment with acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Forty (40) volunteers of all genders with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) were randomized into two study groups: Acupuncture and Sham Acupuncture (non-penetrating device). The patients answered the Southampton Needle Sensation Questionnaire (SNSQ) at the initial and final sessions of acupuncture treatment. The questionnaire was composed of two parts: the first one, consisting of 17 Deqi descriptors and a Likert scale in order to evaluate the intensity of each sensation; and the second one, consisting of a visual analog scale (VAS) to evaluate how painful the acupuncture treatment was. At the initial session, LI4 was the most cited acupuncture point in both groups, being responsible for a ‘Slight Intensity’ needling sensation of electric shock in the acupuncture group at initial (10%) and final (15%) sessions. The most common related needling sensations at different acupuncture points was “Pricking” and “Sharp” in both groups. The acupuncture group showed higher VAS than the Sham Acupuncture either in the initial (3.87 × 2.43) and final (2.04 × 2.14) sessions. Deqi response to acupuncture stimulation was verified either in the both groups. "
"This literature study article will present the possibility of a correlation between the energy meridians of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which can be traced back to the recently described primo vessels (formerly known as Bong-Han ducts), their composition, and the ability of tumors to proliferate and metastasize. It is proposed that microvesicular bodies such as exosomes, known to be involved in cell-to-cell communication, immune response, and tumor proliferation, could be moving across the body via the primo vascular system. The ubiquity of the primo vascular system and its penetration through the blood–brain barrier could also explain the ability of some peripheral tumors (e.g., breast tumor) to metastasize in the brain.

"Introductions Pneumothorax is the most frequent severe acupuncture-related adverse event occurring at the GB 21 acupoint. This study used ultrasonography (US) to measure the depth of the GB 21 acupoint in adults and assessed its applicability for ensuring safe acupuncture practices. Materials and methods A US probe was used to measure the vertical depth from the skin to the pleural line of the apex of the lungs at the right and left GB 21 acupoints. The sex, age, body weight, height, and body mass index of each person were recorded. Student t test and generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analysis. t t Results Sixty women and 41 men with a median age of 29 years were included in this study. The depth of GB 21 increased with body weight, height, and body mass index (p < 0.001). The mean depth of GB 21 in men (17.4 mm) was greater than that in women (14.6 mm; p < 0.001). The depth difference between the right and left shoulders was significant in men (p < 0.001) but not in women. p p p p p p Conclusions US can be used to measure GB 21 acupoint depth. Further control studies on its use to ensure safe clinical practices, including preventing acupuncture-related pneumothorax, are warranted. "
"Objectives Pharmacological labor induction is obtained through prostaglandins application and/or oxytocin infusion; however, the use seems to be related to fetal and maternal side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine advocates the use of acupuncture to soften the cervix and induce uterine contractions. at which presented for The primary outcome was the rate of women admitted for labour induction in case of prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks, and the secondary outcome was the rate of induction planning for other indications. Methods After obtaining informed consent, 375 undelivered women after 40 + 2 gestational age were enrolled for the study: 112 women received acupuncture and 263, routine care. Acupuncture was applied every odd day starting from 40 + 2 weeks up to 41 + 4 weeks. Women allocated to the control group received standard care. At 41 + 5 weeks, a pharmacological induction was planned. Results The rate of labor induction significantly differed between acupuncture and observation groups (19.6% vs. 38%; p < 0.01); in particular, women receiving acupuncture showed a lower rate of induction, indicating prolonged pregnancy (5.3% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.01). p p As far as the pharmacological device is concerned, no differences were observed with regard to the prostaglandins use, whereas oxytocin infusion rate was lower in the acupuncture group than in the observation group. p p Conclusions The present study suggested that acupuncture applied at term of pregnancy seems to be effective in reducing the rate of labor induction which is performed for prolonged pregnancy at 41 + 5 weeks. Moreover, acupuncture also seems to be able to reduce oxytocin use; such a “saving” effect could play a role in childhood, considering that a recent study underlined the adverse effect of oxytocin on birth outcomes.

"Homing of stem cells (SCs) to desired targets such as injured tissues remains a lingering problem in cell-based therapeutics. Studies on the biodistribution of intravenously administered SCs have shown the inefficacy of blood vessels as the homing path because most of the injected SCs are captured in the capillary beds of the lungs. We considered an alternative administration method using the acupuncture meridians or the primo vascular system. We injected SCs at the acupoint Zusanli (ST-36) below the knee of a nude mouse with a spinal cord injured at the thoracic T9-10 vertebrae. The SCs migrated from the ST-36, along the sciatic nerve, the lumbar 4-5, and then the spinal cord to the injury point T9-10. The SCs were not randomly scattered but were rather well aligned like marathon race runners, along the primo vascular system route toward the injury point. We observed the SCs at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hours after injection. The fast runners among the injected SCs took about 6 hours to reach the sciatic nerve, about 9 hours to reach the lumbar 4-5, and about 15 hours to reach the injury point T9-10. "
"The present study evaluates whether the injection of serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, bradykinin, histamine, or substance P (SP) into the Zusanli (Stomach 36, ST 36) acupoint can also produce the acupuncture-induced antinociceptive effect on inflammatory or neuropathic pain. In this in vivo experimental study, a total of 450 male Swiss mice were used. Mice were injected with saline or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or subjected to sham or chronic constriction injury (CCI) surgery. After the establishment of the inflammatory (4 hours) or the neuropathic pain (3 days), the animals (n = 6) received manual acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or injection of saline, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, bradykinin, histamine, or SP into the ST 36 and were evaluated for up to 24 hours. Mechanical threshold was evaluated, and the L4-L6 dorsal root ganglion was used for analysis of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 overexpression. The mice from both the CFA and CCI models treated with manual acupuncture had significant increases in the thresholds for more than 24 hours. Sham acupuncture stimulation did not change the thresholds. In the mice injected with each of the mediators, the thresholds were significantly increased for all times in both the CFA and CCI models. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 overexpression in CFA and CCI mice was reduced at all times by injection of serotonin, acetylcholine, or SP but not by injection of glutamate, histamine, or bradykinin. Our data suggest that the neuroactive mediators released by acupuncture-induced tissue injury may contribute to acupuncture-induced analgesia. in vivo n in vivo n "
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide, and it can result in both permanent disability and serial complications in patients. Research shows that patients with SCI complications are often interested in acupuncture for symptomatic relief. Therefore, the issue of physicians advising their patients regarding the use of acupuncture to alleviate SCI complications becomes pertinent. We review and summarize two types of relevant publications: (1) literature concerning acupuncture for SCI and its complications and (2) underlying mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for SCI. Clinical trials and reviews have suggested that acupuncture effectively manages a range of post-SCI complications, including motor and sensory dysfunction, pain, neurogenic bowel and bladder, pressure ulcers, spasticity, and osteoporosis. The effect of acupuncture on post-SCI orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Decreased oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammation and neuronal apoptosis, regulation of the expression and activity of endogenous biological mediators, and increased regenerative stem cell production are the possible mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for SCI. Although many limitations have been reported in previous studies, given the evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture, we recommend that physicians should support the use of acupuncture therapy for SCI complications.

"This article provides a new definition of an acupuncture meridian. It suggests that a meridian consists of a distal tract of tissue that is affected by organ function. In the 1960s, Kim discovered the primo vascular system and regarded the superficial primo vessels as equating to the meridians. Instead, this article suggests that the superficial primo vessels merely underlie the meridians, in that they enable their creation, which is why some meridians are said to occur along the paths of superficial primo vessels. But the meridians themselves do not have a dedicated anatomical structure; instead they are merely tracts of tissue whose normal function is impeded when the related abdominal organ is stressed. It is hypothesized that the organ information is communicated in electrical waves that may travel through the connective tissue sheaths of the superficial primo vessels. Hence, the primo vessels serve as an inadvertent transport for this information, but the organ information is independent of the physiological purpose of the primo vascular system, as are the resultant meridians.

"Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a socially significant disease that affects millions of patients. There were an estimated 366 million people with this disease in 2011, and, according to the forecast, approximately 552 million will be affected by this disease in 2030. It is well known that the primary diagnosis and treatment of a patient with this disease are quite expensive. What should be done to make it possible for a patient to monitor his own state and provide treatment in his own home using telemedicine? To solve this problem, an alternative concept for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment at the basis of traditional Chinese medicine combined with mathematical methods of data processing has been used. Methods/Design To assess the pattern thresholds of acupuncture channels of heat sensitivity in patients with T2D, the Akabane test was performed on 160 men and 243 women (total 696 tests), including the dynamics of surveillance. For comparison, a group of healthy individuals comprising 116 men and 277 women also participated. Results It was found that the main difference between patients with T2D and the healthy individuals is the presence of a pronounced asymmetry between the right and left branches of the canals, primarily in the digestive system. At the same time, the level of asymmetry increases with the increase in the glycemic level. This dependence allows for the early diagnosis of T2D. Moreover, a targeted stimulation of the definite channels with a high level of asymmetry based on the individual calculations can decrease the glycemic level. Conclusion The combination of the Akabane test with the use of mathematical analysis in patients with T2D makes it possible to trace the entire chain of carbohydrate metabolism at an individual level and to identify the compensatory mechanisms for more effective treatment of reflexotherapy methods. This kind of treatment and monitoring can also be performed by the patient independently in his own home. "
"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most frequent noncommunicable diseases with pain associated symptoms and affects the musculoskeletal system. Various forms of treatment can be indicated, and nonpharmacological treatment is also an available option for the management of KOA individuals. For instance, auriculotherapy (AT) is one possible procedure associated with the Traditional Chinese Medicine for dealing with KOA. It is believed that the concentration of certain biomarkers could be altered in individuals with KOA after AT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of AT on plasma concentration of biomarkers in KOA individuals. This intervention is a controlled trial. Twenty-one subjects were grouped in two groups and submitted to AT with the stimulation of the Shen Men, kidney, and knee points in the treatment group or different points in the control group, once a week for 5 weeks. Blood was collected before the beginning of protocols and a week after the last session. Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests were performed, and a p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hematological parameters did not show any significant variation between the control group and treated group. Concerning the biochemical parameters, a significant reduction of direct bilirubin (from 43.31 ± 22.10 to 21.21 ± 5.30 μmol/L, p = 0.003), aspartate aminotransferase (from 0.48 ± 0.16 to 0.38 ± 0.09 μKat/L, p = 0.010), and triglycerides (from 7.04 ± 2.90 to 5.45 ± 2.57 mmol/L, p = 0.008) in the treated group was obtained. In conclusion, the analysis of results suggests that AT might be a useful intervention for the management of KOA individuals."
"Objective To analyze the effect of auricular acupoint associated with physical exercise on balance, mobility, and fear of falling in the elderly. Method The study is characterized as a clinical, controlled, and randomized trial with 22 elderly people divided into two groups: kinesiotherapy group (n = 11) and kinesiotherapy/auriculotherapy group (n = 11). The instruments used for evaluation were Falls Efficacy Scale International; Berg Balance Scale, and Timed up and Go Test. The intervention was performed with frequency 2×/week for 8 weeks. In the kinesiotherapy/auriculotherapy group, in addition to kinesiotherapy, auriculotherapy was applied in specific acupoints. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data, and for comparison, analysis of variance was used for repeated measures of two factors. Results There was a significant intragroup reduction for the Timed up and Go Test (p = 0.00) and Falls Efficacy Scale International (p = 0.00), and significant intragroup Berg Balance Scale (p = 0.00) for both groups. Conclusion The auricular acupoint did not influence the balance, mobility, and fear of falling in the elderly studied. "
"Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common musculoskeletal disorder. This study was designed to compare the effects of aerobic exercise plus acupuncture with acupuncture alone in treatment of patients with MPS. Sixty-four patients (55 female and 9 male) with MPS in their neck and shoulders participated in the study with mean age of 33.1 ± 6.4 years. Participants were randomly allocated to aerobic exercise plus acupuncture (n = 32) or acupuncture alone (n = 32) groups. Outcome measurements included visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, and quality of life that was measured with QoL-SF36 scale. Each group received 10 sessions of acupuncture in combination with aerobic exercise or acupuncture alone. The outcome measures were evaluated at baseline, at the end of the last treatment session, and at 1-month follow-up visit. While participants were waiting for their 1-month follow-up visit, the patients who received combination therapy were asked to continue their aerobic exercise by jogging 40 minutes a day. Although mean visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, and QoL-SF36 were significantly improved in both groups (p < 0.001), there was no statistically significant difference among the measures between the two groups throughout the evaluated sessions. The interaction effect of time and groups did not show any significant difference among the outcome measures (p > 0.29)."
"Objectives To compare between acupuncture and acupressure for preventing menstrual migraine (MM). Methods MM is one kind of migraine associated with menses in female. It is often associated with increased menstrual distress and disability, leading to decreased daily activity and quality of life. A randomized and controlled pilot study was conducted with three groups: verum acupuncture (VA) group, acupressure (AP) group, and control acupuncture (CA) group. The study lasted for 7 cycle-months, with a 1 cycle-month baseline observation (T1), a 3 cycle-month intervention (3 times per cycle-month) (T2–T4), and a 3 cycle-month follow-up (T5–T7). Outcome measures were number of migraine days, average and peak pain, total duration period of MM, and percentage of patients with ≥50% reduction in the number of MM days. Results A total of 18 participants were included in the analysis (VA, n = 7; AP, n = 6; CA, n = 5). Both VA and AP were significantly more effective than CA for reducing MM days during the intervention period. Both VA and AP tended to be more effective than CA for reducing peak pain during the intervention period. No significant differences for the outcomes were observed among VA, AP, and CA during the follow-up period. No serious adverse events were reported. Discussion Results of the pilot study suggest that both VA and AP could be considered as alternative and safe prophylactic interventions for MM."
"We investigate the biocompatibility of a new class of acupuncture needles that possess a hierarchical nano/microscale porous surface topology, referred to as porous acupuncture needles (PAN). The PAN is synthesized via a facile electrochemical anodization technique by which a surface area approximately 20 times greater than a conventional acupuncture needle, of approximately the same diameter, is obtained. PAN biocompatibility is evaluated using a variety of standard tests, with results indicating that the PAN can safely be used within therapeutic practice. "
"It is known that the primo vascular system (PVS) includes the primo nodes and vessels. However, the relevant genes in the PVS system for both pathologic and physiologic condition are poorly understood. Here, we first examined the gene expression in primo vessels (PVs) floating in lymphatic endothelium by isolation of PVS and lymphatic vessels (LVs) containing PVS. To investigate therapeutic effects, both PVs and LVs containing PVS were isolated after lipopolysaccharide injection and acupuncture electric stimulation at two acupoints Joksamni (ST36) and Hapgok (LI04) following lipopolysaccharide injection. We used reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction to examine expression of lymphatic endothelial cell markers and inflammatory related genes. We found that lymphatic endothelial cell markers such as fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt4), lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor (Lyve-1), prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox-1), and podoplanin (Pdpn) were highly expressed in PV compared to that of lymphatic endothelium, suggesting pivotal roles of PV in LV under inflammation. Furthermore, lymphatic-related genes including metal-response element-binding transcription factor 2 (Mtf2), hypoxia inducible factor (Hif1a), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Agtr1), and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (Agtr2) were also overall increased in PV, and remarkably increased and these genes except peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (Pparg) after acupuncture electric stimulation in two acupoints implying central role of PV by gene activation. fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt4) lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor (Lyve-1) prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox-1) podoplanin (Pdpn) Mtf2) h Hif1a) Agtr1) Agtr2 Pparg) fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt4) lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor (Lyve-1) prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox-1) podoplanin (Pdpn) Mtf2) h Hif1a) Agtr1) Agtr2 Pparg) "
"This study aims to investigate the possible mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) at PC6 to improve myocardial ischemia (MI) by regulating the cardiac transient outward potassium current channel (Ito). According to the random number table, the mice were divided into six groups of six mice each: control group, MI group, PC6, LU7 (Lieque-point), ST36 (Zusanli-point), and nonacupoint group. Mice in the control group were injected with saline (20 mg/kg, 24 hours interval), and the other ASIC3 −/− mice were injected subcutaneously twice with isoproterenol (ISO) (20 mg/kg, 24 hours interval). In the preexperiment, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg of ISO were used, and the results showed that 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of ISO both could induce acute MI, but shorter duration of sustained MI. On the other hand, an injection of 30 mg/kg can make the mice experience arrhythmia or die immediately, and EA was operated at PC6, LU7, ST36 acupoints, and nonacupoint in the mice of PC6, LU7, ST36, and nonacupoint groups, respectively, after injecting twice. Then Western blotting techniques (Western Blot) were used to analyze the protein expressions of Kv1.4, Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KchIP2. The results of this experiment showed that the protein expressions of Kv1.4, Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIP2 in MI group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.01). Compared with MI group, the results of PC6, LU7, and ST36 groups obviously increased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expressions of PC6 group were higher than LU7 group and ST36 group (p < 0.05). And electrocardiogram's T-waves showed obvious pathological changes in the MI group compared to the control group (p < 0.01). After EA, the abnormal T-waves voltage of ECG in PC6, LU7, and ST36 groups was improved (p < 0.05). In addition, the rate change of PC6 group was larger than that of both LU7 and ST36 groups (p < 0.05). But the T-waves voltage of the nonacupoint group was not significantly different than that of the MI group (p > 0.05)."
"The objective of this study was to compare the effects of one or multiple sessions of electroacupuncture (EA) in patients with chronic low back pain. The outcome measures were visual analog score (VAS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), low back skin temperature, surface electromyography of longissimus muscle (contraction/rest) and blood cytokines. After examination (AV0), patients were submitted to EA (2 Hz, 30 minutes, bilaterally at the SP6, BL23, BL31, BL32, BL33, and BL60) and were revaluated after one week (AV1). Patients with VAS <3 (VAS <3 group, n = 20) were directed to return after three weeks (AV2). Patients with VAS >3 (VAS >3 group, n = 20) were submitted to one weekly EA-treatment and revaluated after three weeks (AV2). The VAS <3 group showed a significant reduction in VAS and MPQ and increased PPT in AV1, but not in AV2. No significant differences were found in RMDQ. The VAS >3 group showed reduction in VAS and increased PPT in AV1 and a reduction in MPQ and RMDQ only in AV2. No significant differences were found in electromyography, temperature or cytokines. Thus, despite 2Hz-EA is effective reducing low back pain, some patients only experienced reduced pain intensity and improved functional capacity after full treatment."
"Cupping therapy is an ancient traditional and complementary medicine practice. Recently, there is growing evidence of its potential benefits in the treatment of pain-related diseases. This article gives an overview of cupping therapy practice. Furthermore, this article suggests a new classification of cupping therapy sets, a new classification of cupping therapy adverse events, and an updated classification of cupping therapy types. "
"The present study aimed to determine whether isoflurane interferes with the analgesic effects of acupuncture (Ac) and electroacupuncture (EA), using a neuropathic pain (NP) rat model. In total, 140 male Wistar rats were used; isoflurane-induced nociceptive response was evaluated using the von Frey test, serum calcium-binding protein β (S100β) levels and nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in the left sciatic nerve. The NP model was induced by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve at 14 days after surgery. Treatment was initiated after NP induction with or without isoflurane anesthesia (20 min/day/8 days). The von Frey test was performed at baseline, 14 days postoperatively, and immediately, 24 h, and 48 h after the last treatment. Results of the nociceptive test and three-way analysis of variance were analyzed by generalized estimating equations, the Bonferroni test, followed by Student–Newman–Keuls or Fisher's least significant difference tests for comparing biochemical parameters (significance defined as p ≤ 0.05). At baseline, no difference was noted in the nociceptive response threshold among all groups. Fourteen days after surgery, compared with other groups, NP groups showed a decreased pain threshold, confirming establishment of NP. Ac and EA enhanced the mechanical pain threshold immediately after the last session in the NP groups, without anesthesia. Isoflurane administration caused increased nociceptive threshold in all groups, and this effect persisted for 48 h after the last treatment. There was an interaction between the independent variables: pain, treatments, and anesthesia in serum S100β levels and NGF levels in the left sciatic nerve. Isoflurane enhanced the analgesic effects of Ac and EA and altered serum S100β and left sciatic nerve NGF levels in rats with NP."
"Introduction and objective Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is among the most common and important reasons for visiting a spine surgeon by patients; it is the second cause of visiting a doctor. Low back pain can cause considerable suffering and is a major financial burden in the society. There are many different methods available for the treatment of CLBP. This study aimed to compare the cost-utility of electroacupuncture (EA) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as two common treatment methods for patients with CLBP. Methods This study was conducted on 100 patients suffering from CLBP. Cases were randomly selected from patients referring to two hospitals and four acupuncture clinics in Tehran. Forty-one patients received EA, and 59 patients were prescribed NSAIDs. The EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire was used to calculate quality-adjusted life-year. For calculating the total cost of the two treatment methods, face to face interview with patients was conducted by the researchers (using specific basic literature questionnaire), neurologists, and spine surgeons. The study perspective was social (direct and indirect costs calculated). Results The mean age for EA group was 41 ± 2.3 years, and for NSAIDs group, it was 38.0 ± 4.4 years. The average of the utility of patients under treatment by EA and NSAIDs was estimated as 0.70 and 0.627, respectively. The difference in utility between the two groups was significant (p ≤ 0.05). The total cost of EA and NSAIDs was estimated as 461.48 ± 57.8$ and 497.77 ± 85.2$ for one year (2016), respectively, which was also significant (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion The results indicate a significant difference between EA and NSAIDs in cases of both utility and total cost. The findings demonstrate that EA is more cost-effective than NSAIDs, as therefore can be considered as an alternative treatment for CLBP, with reasonable cost-utility. "
"Introduction Clinic-based acupuncturists, midwives, and physiotherapists have reported using acupuncture to treat lumbopelvic pain in pregnancy, a common condition that may affect functioning and quality of life. To contribute to the emerging evidence on treatment outcomes, we collected patient-reported pain reduction data from women treated during pregnancy in a no-pay, hospital-based acupuncture service in New Zealand. Methods Observational study of patient-reported symptom reduction.The main outcome measure was the MYMOP (Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile), a brief, validated self-report instrument. Open-ended questions on treatment experiences and adverse events were included. Results Of the 81 women on whom we had complete treatment data, the majority (N = 72, 89%) reported clinically meaningful symptom reduction. Patient-reported adverse events were infrequent and mild. N N Discussion Patient-reported and treatment-related lumbopelvic pain symptom reduction findings provide further evidence that acupuncture in pregnancy is safe and beneficial in a field setting. We discuss this study's unique contributions in providing guidance for clinicians who practice acupuncture in pregnancy, including midwives, physiotherapists, and physicians. "
"According to popular belief, metabolic disorders and imbalances are one of the main factors contributing to various human illnesses. Early diagnosis of these disorders is one of the main methods for preventing serious diseases. The goal of this study was to assess the correlations between main physical indicators and the activity of certain acupuncture channels using the thermal Akabane test based on ancient Chinese diagnostic methods. This test measures the pain thresholds' temperature sensitivity when a point source of heat is applied to the “entrance–exit” points of each channel. The skin temperature sensitivity in our bodies is a basic reactive system; it is as significant as such important indicators as body temperature and provides a very clear representation of functional and psychophysiological profiles. On the basis of our statistical study, we revealed reliable correspondence between the activity of certain acupuncture channels and main anthropometric and biometric data. "
"The leading cause of disability in adults, leads to different consequences, such as hemiparesis and loss of function in the upper limb which can impair the performance of activities of daily living. Different techniques, such as like acupuncture and Kinesio Taping (KT), have been used to ameliorate this condition. However, there is no consensus on their concomitant effect on neurological patients. This study aimed to analyze the effects of acupuncture associated with KT on the upper limb of patients with chronic hemiparesis after stroke. In this clinical study, 16 subjects were divided into two intervention groups: acupuncture (ACP)—12 sessions of acupuncture—and acupuncture + Kinesio Taping (ACP-KT)—12 sessions of acupuncture plus KT. The Modified Ashworth Scale (spasticity), active goniometry [range of motion (ROM)], and the Wolf Motor Function Test (speed of movement) were used to assess the function of the affected upper limb. As a main result, both groups reduced spasticity in some studied musculature and increased ROM (p < 0.05), without intergroup difference. Moreover, there was no significant improvement concerning speed of movement in either group. Acupuncture was effective in reducing spasticity and increasing ROM of paretic upper limb after stroke, but did not contribute significantly to speed and quality of movement. KT did not show significant benefits concerning the analyzed variables."
"Current treatment for calcific tendonitis consists of arm rest, antiinflammatory medications, and corticosteroid injections. If unsuccessful, a lot of clinicians suggest several physiotherapy modalities, such as shockwave therapy and electrotherapy. The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture, as a substitute for failed medical treatment in calcific tendonitis. In a pilot study, we prospectively followed 10 patients treated with electroacupuncture for calcific tendonitis who failed to respond to medical treatment. Its efficacy was assessed by evaluating the level of pain, the Beck Depression Inventory, the range of active elbow mobility, and by repeated radiological evaluation of the course of calcific deposits. All clinical and radiological observations were recorded before and within 6 months after the onset of treatment. After electroacupuncture treatment (2 Hz, 180 mA for 30–60 seconds at GB21, GB34, LI4, LI 14, LI15, TW5, TW14, Chien Chien SI9, SI12, S37, S38), the visual analog score decreased notably, and the range of motion returned to normal. Radiological evaluation demonstrated almost complete absorption of calcific deposits within 6 months, after treatment. We conclude that electroacupuncture relieved skeletal pain, improved the quality of patient's life, and contributed to total regression of the calcific depositions in followed patients. So, electroacupuncture may be a valuable treatment option for calcific tendonitis, when medical treatment fails to relieve symptoms. "
"The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare intra and intergroup the immediate effect of the auricular and LR8 systemic acupuncture on the electromyographic activity of the trapezius with the trigger points. This is an experimental clinical trial; 40 people were split in 4 distinct groups (n = 10): GI mustard seed application in the auricular acupoint; GII bilateral needle application in the LR8 acupoint; GIII combination of the techniques; GIV/Control Group mustard seed application in an acupoint not linked to the muscle tension. The EMG was used to assess the muscle contraction for 5 seconds during the resting time and during the isometric contraction time. The EMG signal was first collect without the acupuncture intervention; then both techniques were applied for 5 minutes; and the EMG was collected again right after these applications. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used, the t test was paired with the Wilcoxon test to the intragroup comparison; One-way analysis of variance test for intergroup comparison. There was no statistical difference in the intragroup comparison for the groups. The same happened to the intergroup comparison before and after application. Systemic and auricular acupuncture did not promote immediate changes in the EMG activity of the trapezius muscle in individuals with MTrPs."
"Temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) is a set of changes that affects the muscles of mastication, temporomandibular joint, teeth, and associated periodontal and orofacial structures. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the imbalance of energy (Qi) circulating in the acupuncture meridians is always the primary etiologic cause of any physical manifestation. The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of Qi imbalance in patients with TMD by means of an objective measurement. The clinical study was conducted at the Piracicaba Dental School (FOP/Unicamp), in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil. We evaluated 40 adult volunteers with TMD. The Qi measurement was carried out by the researcher using the Ryodoraku method using 24 points representing the 12 acupuncture meridians: LU9 (Taiyuan), PC7 (Daling), HT7 (Shemen), SI5 (Yanggu), TE4 (Yangchi), LI5 (Yangxi), SP3 (Taibai), LR3 (Taichong), KI3 (Taixi), BL64 (Jinggu), GB40 (Qiuxu), and ST42 (Chongyang). The average total Qi of 40 volunteers (21.7 μA ± 1.5), was below the normal range (40–60 μA) and was classified as deficiency of Qi (empty). The coupled meridians that showed the highest Qi imbalance were the kidney (29.4 μA ± 2.8) and bladder (13.8 μA ± 1). The Qi planes with greatest imbalance were the Shao Yang and Shao Yin. In conclusion, volunteers with TMD presented a pattern of Qi deficiency, and the most prevalent imbalance patterns identified were in the kidney and bladder coupled meridians and in the energetic planes Shao Yin (heart/kidney) and Shao Yang (triple energizer/gall bladder).

"Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of smoking on the bioelectrical potential (BEP) at 12 alarm points. Methods A crossover study was conducted on 17 normal adult male smokers. The BEP was measured at 12 alarm points both before and after breathing through a filter (control) and smoking. Results The participants were classified into three subtypes according to the way in which their BEP changed after having breathed through a filter: increasing, decreasing, and irregular types. Compared with breathing through a filter, smoking decreased the BEP in the increasing type, whereas it increased the BEP in the decreasing type. No significant changes were observed in the irregular-type participants. Conclusions This study suggests that smoking increases sympathetic activity in smokers with a parasympathetic tendency, whereas it lessens sympathetic activity in smokers with a sympathetic tendency. Smoking does this by eliminating the intrinsic tendency of the autonomic nervous system, and these effects can be observed in the BEP at 12 alarm points. "
"Autism is considered as a complex developmental disability that appears during the first two years of life. It is considered as a neurological disorder that affects brain function leading to impaired development in social interaction and communication skills. Some clinical trials demonstrated that certain acupuncture points play relatively significant role in improving both signs and symptoms of this disease. Owing to limited information available about acupuncture point's combination and protocols, the present study aimed to explore the most frequently used acupuncture points and their channels for children with autism. Thirteen articles about autism enhancement were selected from 2007 to 2015. Acupoints and their channels used in these articles were analyzed according to usage frequencies. The present study identified the following main channels that contribute to autism symptoms enhancement along with the corresponding points' frequencies: Governing Vessel channel (12), Gall bladder channel (9), Kidney channel (8), Pericardium channel (7), Extra points channel (7), Liver channel (7), Heart channel (6), Conception vessel channel (6), and Bladder channel (6). On the other hand, the frequency of each corresponding acupuncture points are EX-HN1 (5), GV-17 (4), PC-6 (4), LR-3 (3), KI-3 (3), HT-7 (3), Lu-9 (3), GV-20 (2), GV-24 (2), GV-24.5 (2), GB-13(2), GB-19 (2), KI-4 (2), LR-4 (2), ST-36 (2), SP-3 (2), SP-6 (2). In conclusion, the consensus is that both channels and points may have an important role in autism symptoms enhancement. Based on the present study, the specific channels and points selection and stimulation types need further investigation through clinical trials. "
"Common phenomena central to acupuncture have been overlooked by previous hypotheses on how acupuncture works, with the result that the hypotheses are unable to account for acupuncture's effects. This article describes the main features overlooked and suggests how these might be investigated in future acupuncture research. "
"We have reported a model that distinguishes pain adaptive individuals (PA) from those who are pain non-adaptive (PNA). The present randomised, cross-over, participant-assessor blinded study aimed to determine the impact of pain adaptability on individuals’ response to real and sham acupuncture. Healthy volunteers (nine PA and 13 PNA) were randomly allocated to receive real and sham acupuncture on the left hand and forearm in two separate acupuncture sessions. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured at bilateral forearms and right leg before, immediately after and 20 minutes after the end of acupuncture. Ratings to pinprick and suprathreshold PPT were also recorded. The two groups were comparable in their demographic and baseline data. Analgesia induced by real or sham acupuncture did not differ on any outcome measures. PA responded to acupuncture needling better than PNA, and to sham needling (20% increase in PPT) better than to real acupuncture (7.9%). Those differences were at 20 min after end of acupuncture in the areas distant to the needling sites. PNA reported little changes in PPT. Being adaptive to pain was associated with enhanced distant analgesia in response to sham acupuncture. Our finding might partly explain varied acupuncture analgesia in clinical practice and trials. "
"Emergency pain management in symptomatic irreversible pulpitis commonly includes use of nonnarcotic analgesics. Acupuncture has been used in dentistry to alleviate pain after tooth extraction. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of acupuncture therapy and ibuprofen for pain management in such patients. A total of 157 patients participated in this study and were randomly assigned to three groups, Group I—classical acupuncture with placebo tablet, Group II—sham acupuncture with placebo tablet, and Group III—sham acupuncture with ibuprofen. Before commencement of the experiment, initial pain assessment was done using a HP-VAS scale. Treatment was done by first operator, while pain assessment was done by the second operator who was blinded to the procedure performed. Acupuncture needles were inserted for 15–20 minutes at acupoints for classical acupuncture and at nonacupoints for sham acupuncture. Posttreatment pain assessment was carried out at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes intervals. Follow-up analysis was recorded at 12, 24, and 48 hours using VAS verbal scale. The mean final HP VAS values for Group I showed statistically significant lower pain values when compared with groups II and III (p < 0.05), with no significant difference between groups II and III. Follow-up analysis showed Group I with higher percentage of no pain, which was statistically significant when compared with other two groups. It can be concluded that classical acupuncture is more effective in pain relief (faster and prolonged) than analgesics."
"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), recognized as the most common conditions of chronic orofacial pain, have a multifactorial etiology. Acupuncture can help to relieve the pain and discomfort associated with these conditions, because it can rebalance the energy (Qi) circulating in the meridians. The aim of the study was to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the pain; mouth opening limitation, and energy circulating in the meridians of patients with TMD of muscular or mixed origin. This was a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted at the Piracicaba Dental School (FOP/Unicamp), in Piracicaba SP, Brazil. The Treatment Group received acupuncture with real penetration of the needle, and the Placebo Group received a sham treatment without needle penetration. The acupoints used were: ST6, ST7, SI18, GV20, GB20, BL10, and LI4, during treatment performed for four weekly sessions. The TMD and mouth opening were evaluated according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC). The measurements of the energy at the meridians were performed by the Ryodoraku method, before and after acupuncture in all of the sessions in both groups. The results showed no decrease in pain in the Treatment Group when compared with the Placebo Group (p = 0.2261). There was no increase in the oral opening limit in the Treatment Group compared with the Placebo Group (p > 0.05). Regarding the energy levels, after acupuncture, there was a decrease in Yang energy in all sessions (p < 0.05), in both groups, however, only real acupuncture was effective in maintaining the Yin energy average throughout the four sessions, with significant difference between groups (p = 0.0198). In conclusion, volunteers with TMD presented a pattern of energy deficiency and the most prevalent imbalance patterns identified were in the meridians coupled to the kidney and bladder, and in the Shao Yin (heart/kidney) and Shao Yang (triple energizer/gall bladder) energetic planes. The acupuncture points used were equally effective in reducing pain in both groups; increasing the unassisted mouth opening limitation without pain in the Treatment Group, and were also effective in preserving the Yin energy in the Treatment Group. The Yang energy decreased equally in both groups."
"The burden of stroke is high and is continually increasing due to a dramatic growth in the world's elderly population. Novel therapeutic strategies are therefore required. The present study sought to determine the effect of laser acupuncture at GV20 on brain damage, oxidative-status markers in the cerebral cortex, and superoxide dismutase in the mitochondria of an animal model of focal ischemic stroke. Wistar rats, weighing 300–350 g, were divided into the following four groups: (1) control; (2) permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (Rt.MCAO) alone; (3) Rt.MCAO plus sham laser acupuncture; and (4) Rt.MCAO plus laser-acupuncture groups. Sham laser acupuncture or laser acupuncture was performed once daily at the GV20 (Baihui) acupoint for 14 days following Rt.MCAO. Half of the rats in each group were examined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining to determine the brain infarct volume, while the other half were examined by biochemical assays to determine the malondialdehyde level, and the glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide-dismutase activities in the brain-cortex mitochondria. The results showed that laser acupuncture at GV20 significantly decreased the brain infarct volume and malondialdehyde level, and increased the catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide-dismutase activities in cerebral ischemic rats. In conclusion, laser acupuncture at GV20 decreases the brain infarct volume in cerebral ischemic rats, at least in part due to decreased oxidative stress. Further study is warranted to investigate other possible underlying mechanisms. "
"Objectives The present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of the traditional Korean medical pharmacopuncture, Liver Qi Depression (HJ11), in a mouse model of depression induced by exposure to chronic immobilization stress (CIS). Liver Qi Depression Liver Qi Depression Methods Mice were subjected to 2 hours of immobilization stress daily for 14 days. They were also injected with distilled water (DW) (CIS + DW) or HJ11 at the acupoints HT7, SP6, and GV20 (CIS + HJ11) an hour before stress. The positive control group (CIS + paroxetine) was intraperitoneally injected with paroxetine (10 mg/kg, 14 days). The tail suspension test and the forced swimming test were performed to assess depression-like behaviors. Western blotting was also conducted to seek the change in brain. Results CIS + DW mice showed significantly longer immobile times in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test than sham mice that did not go through daily restraint. Immobility of CIS + HJ11 and that of CIS + paroxetine mice was significantly decreased compared with immobility of CIS + DW mice. Immunoblotting showed that HJ11 increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor both in the hippocampus and the amygdala. Conclusion HJ11 improves depressive-like behaviors in the stress-induced mouse model of depression, and the results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of HJ11, identified by brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, may play a critical role in its antidepressant effect.

"This study aimed to identify procedural elements of Japanese acupuncture, describe these elements in detail, and explain them in terms of the key thematic category of treatment principles. Between August 2012 and December 2016, ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in Japan. In total, 38 participants were recruited by chain referral and emergent sampling. Data was collected through participant observation, interviews, and by analyzing documents. A total of 22 participants agreed to clinical observation; 221 treatments were observed with 172 patients. Seventeen consented to formal interviews and 28 to informal interviews. Thematic analysis was used to critically evaluate data. One especially interesting theme was interpreted from the data: a variety of contact tools were applied in treatment and these were manipulated by adjusting elements of form, speed, repetition, and pressure. Tapping, holding, pressing/pushing, and stroking were the most important ways contact tools were used on patients. Contact tools are noninvasive, painless, can be applied in almost any environment, and may be easily accepted by patients worldwide. Contact tool theory and practice may be successfully integrated into acupuncture curricula outside of Japan, used to inform clinical trials, and contribute to an expanded repertoire of methods for practitioners to benefit individual patients in international contexts.

"The aim of this study was to examine the additive effect of medical acupuncture on controlling the symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS). A total of 46 randomly allocated patients diagnosed with RLS were assigned to receive either 10 sessions of acupuncture plus gabapentin (300 mg/d), or gabapentin (300 mg/d) alone (23 patients in each group) over 4 weeks in a single-blind study. The symptoms of patients were assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLSRS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline, just after the therapeutic course and 8 weeks later. For all outcome measures, there was a significant time-group interaction, showing that the behavior of groups differed regarding changes in VAS, IRLSRS, and PSQI in favor of the experimental group. After therapeutic course termination and in 8 weeks follow up, VAS and IRLSRS had a significant improvement in both the experimental group and the control group, but PSQI improved significantly just in the experimental group. Based on the findings of the present study, acupuncture plus a low dose of gabapentin (300 mg/d) is clinically useful in the treatment of RLS during 8 weeks follow up, and also has an additive therapeutic effect over gabapentin alone in patients with RLS. "
"Veterinary acupuncture is becoming increasingly implemented for various disease processes, with growing numbers of veterinarians pursuing advanced training to meet the rising demand for this relatively new intervention. Accurate acupoint placement remains challenging, with individual practitioners relying on varying methods of point identification, often compounded by the transpositional nature of points for companion animals. The aim of this study was to assess for differences in acupuncture needle placement of select points between veterinary professionals with three different levels of acupuncture training in an academic teaching environment. Seven participants placed a total of six acupoints on a canine cadaver. Digital radiography was used to document each participant's point placement. Each participant's point location was then compared to a control “correct” point, and the distance between the two points was measured. A significant difference in placement accuracy was identified between the participants when grouped by training level (p = 0.03). These results indicate that veterinary patients receiving acupuncture treatment from veterinarians with different levels of training may subsequently experience varying effects, although further studies are warranted on more specific acupoint description as well as the clinical implications of needle placement accuracy."
"Introduction For developing a hardness multipoint measurement system for understanding hardness distribution on biological body surfaces, we investigated the spring strength of the contact portion main axis of a biological tissue hardness meter (product name: PEK). Methods We measured the hardness of three-layered sheets of six types of gel sheets (90 mm × 60 mm × 6 mm) constituting the acupuncture practice pads, with PEK measurements of 1.96 N, 2.94 N, 3.92 N, 4.90 N, 5.88 N, 6.86 N, 7.84 N, 8.82 N, and 9.81 N of the main axis spring strength. We obtained measurements 10 times for the gel sheets and simultaneously measured the load using a digital scale. We measured the hardness distribution of induration embedded and breast cancer palpation models, with a main axis with 1.96 N, 4.90 N, and 9.81 N spring strengths, to create a two-dimensional Contour Fill Chart. Results Using 4.90 N spring strength, we could obtain measurement loads of ≤3.0 N, and the mean hardness was 5.14 mm. This was close to the median of the total measurement range 0.0–10.0 mm, making the measurement range the largest for this spring strength. We could image the induration of the induration-embedded model regardless of the spring strength. Conclusion Overall, 4.90 N spring strength was best suited for imaging cancer in the breast cancer palpation model. "
"Objective To investigate the effect of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on PC6 acupuncture point in suppressing gag reflex, regulating pulse rates and oxygen saturation, thereby reducing the anxiety levels. Materials and Method A total of 40 patients who demonstrated hyperactive gag reflex in the age group of 4-14 years were included in the study. In Group A (20 patients), maxillary impression was recorded. In the second step, PC6 acupuncture point was stimulated with LLLT followed by recording of second maxillary impression. In group B (20 patients), steps were reversed. Gag reflex, anxiety levels, pulse rate and oxygen saturation levels were assessed. Results Values of pulse rate and oxygen saturation were regulated to normal, signifying lowered anxiety levels. Gag reflex was also significantly decreased after stimulating PC6 acupuncture point with LLLT. Conclusion LLLT on PC6 point was found to be effective in lowering anxiety levels as observed by faces modified anxiety rating scale. Further, it was authenticated as the pulse rates were significantly reduced and oxygen saturation levels were significantly increased. Also, gag reflex was significantly controlled when LASER stimulation was done at PC6. "
"Objectives To assess the quality and completeness of published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of moxibustion. Method We searched six databases to retrieve eligible RCTs of moxibustion published from 2000 to December 2015. We used the STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Moxibustion (STRICTOM) and Risk of Bias (ROB) tool to assess the completeness of reporting of RCTs of moxibustion and evaluate the reporting quality of included RCTs. Results Thirty-four studies of moxibustion were analyzed using STRICTOM and ROB. Of the 34 studies, the completeness percentage of STRICTOM varied from 33% to 100% (mean 68%, median 67%). The completeness of STRICTOM items showed a rising tendency along with the publication year. The STRICTOM items of setting and context (14.7%), rationale for the control (17.6%), and response (26.4%) showed incomplete reporting. The number of RCTs that rated a low risk of bias for allocation concealment (n = 6), blinding of participants and personnel (n = 1), and blinding of outcome assessment (n = 4) appeared to be small. Conclusion The quality of reporting of RCTs of moxibustion remains incomplete according to the STRICTOM and ROB tool at present. Researchers should consider the STRICTOM and ROB for improving not only the completeness of reporting but also the study design. General guidelines for RCTs of moxibustion are also required. "
"Background Similar to De Qi psychophysical responses, propagated sensation along the channels (PSC) is considered an important phenomenon in traditional Chinese acupuncture. In acupuncture clinical trials, different acupuncture manipulation techniques are used to enhance the propagation of sensation along the channels to facilitate an optimum therapeutic result. Aim To examine and compare the PSC reported by participants in a clinical trial following the administration of acupuncture and inactive mock laser. Methods The study was embedded in a two-arm parallel design multicenter, randomized clinical trial, the Tennis Elbow Acupuncture—International Study—China, Hong Kong, Australia, Italy (TEA IS CHAI). Needle sensations were measured using a validated instrument, the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Spreading Scale. Ninety-six participants with lateral elbow pain were randomly allocated into two groups in a 1:1 ratio; the acupuncture treatment group (n = 47) and the mock laser control group (n = 49). Participants in both groups received the intervention at two acupoints, LI10 and LI11, consisting of 2 minutes of either standardized needle manipulation or mock laser at each acupoint with a rest period between each intervention period. Data were collected immediately following the interventions at the first and the ninth session within the clinical trial. Results Although participants in both groups perceived PSC radiating to similar sites along the upper limb, the frequency of the reported radiation sites among the two intervention groups for both radiation up the limb (p < 0.05) and radiation down the limb (p < 0.001) were statistically significantly different. Among the radiating sensation sites recorded within the two study groups, the sensations were reported as radiating a greater distance down the forearm to the wrist compared to up the arm. Evaluation of PSC across the four study sites revealed a statistically significant difference in frequency of the reported radiation down the limb sites in each study group and radiation up the limb sites only in control group only (p < 0.001). Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrated that the PSC phenomenon is not just associated with needling but can be perceived when using a mock laser. Trial registration Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry reference: ACTRN12613001138774 on 11th of October 2013. "
"Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a major global health problem. Needling at CV-12 has reduced blood glucose level in diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of needling at CV-12 (Zhongwan) on blood glucose level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and Methods Forty T2DM patients were recruited and randomized into either the acupuncture group or placebo control group. The participants in the acupuncture group were needled at CV-12 (4 cun above the center of the umbilicus), and those in the placebo control group were needled at a placebo point on the right side of the abdomen (1 cun beside the CV-12). For both groups, the needle was retained for 30 minutes. Assessments were performed prior to and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16. Results There was a significant reduction in random blood glucose level in the acupuncture group compared to baseline. No such significant change was observed in the placebo control group. Conclusion The result of this study suggests that 30 minutes of needling at CV-12 might be useful in reducing blood glucose level in patients with T2DM. "
"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for ACD despite their significant adverse effects. Acupuncture has been widely used in the treatment of various skin diseases, but its underlying mechanism remains unrevealed. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of acupuncture treatment based on effectiveness and mechanism. BALB/c mice received 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) application to build AD-like model. Results showed that acupuncture was an effective treatment method in inhibiting inflammatory conditions, serum IgE levels, and expression of proinflammatory cytokine Th2 (IL-4, IL-6), and Th2 (IL-1β, TNF-α) mRNA compared with DNCB treatment. Acupuncture treatment also inhibited nuclear factor-κB p65, phosphorylation of IκBα, and phosphorylation of occludin proteins expression. Furthermore, it could improve the expression of epidermal growth factor in both mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that acupuncture, as an alternative therapy treatment for its no significant side effects, was effective in alleviating ACD by reducing proinflammatory cytokines and changing proteins' expression.

"The novel therapeutic strategy against autism is essential due to the limited therapeutic efficacy. Based on the benefit of laser acupuncture at HT7 acupoint on the neurological disorders related with oxidative stress and inflammation, its benefit on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and GABAergic/glutamatergic imbalance in cerebellum of autism have been considered. To elucidate this issue, male rat pups were induced autistic-like conditions by valproic acid (VPA) and treated with laser acupuncture at HT7 acupoint once daily between postnatal Day 14 and Day 40. At the end of study, the changes of oxidative stress markers, the expressions of cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) proteins (65 kDa and 67 kDa) together with gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) activity and density of Purkinje cell in the cerebellum were assessed. The results showed that laser acupuncture HT7 decreased oxidative stress, IL-6 expression, and GABA-T activity but increased the expressions of GAD 65 kDa together with the density of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Therefore, laser acupuncture at HT7 is the potential strategy to improve the cerebellar disorders in VPA-rat model of autism. The mechanism may occur partly via the decrease of oxidative stress status, inflammation, and the improved GABAergic function. "
"Currently, there is no definitive diagnosis or list of signs and symptoms for “stress” in either modern biomedicine or Chinese medicine (CM). While modern theories on stress relate to the neurological interaction of a stressor or stimuli on the autonomic nervous system, it is generally regarded as subjective in nature and as such each individual will likely present varying somatic or cognitive signs and symptoms. A questionnaire was therefore developed, based on textual research, that incorporated both general as well as gender specific signs and symptom responses to determine the most common CM patterns associated with individuals who report as feeling stressed. For the 45 females who completed the questionnaire, the mean percentage of symptoms per CM pattern showed that the pattern with the highest average percentage was heart qi deficiency (61.88%) followed by liver blood deficiency (60.23%) and then heart blood deficiency (60.12%). For males (n = 16), heart qi deficiency was also the highest scoring CM pattern with a scoring percentage of 54.81%. In males, however, heart blood deficiency was second with 53.29% followed by liver blood deficiency with 51.10%. Of the general non gender-specific symptoms collected (n = 65 symptoms), the symptom most commonly reported by both men and women was “anxious or racing thoughts”, followed by “constant worrying” and “inability to concentrate”. The CM diagnostic pattern results may prove useful for clinicians as the change in diagnostic understanding will also modify the treatment principle and subsequent treatment with acupuncture or herbal medicine. Future CM research studies should consider including the questionnaire either as a diagnostic aid or as an outcome measure for acupuncture or herbal medicine studies related to stress."
"Purpose Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is known not to have a successful therapy as yet. More recently, acupuncture, some herbal compounds, and trigger point injection have been reported to be beneficial. Pharmacopuncture is an herbal acupuncture having these benefits. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of HP (Hwanglyunhaedok Pharmacopuncture) versus normal saline injection (Saline Pharmacopuncture, SP) on CP/CPPS. Methods A retrospective follow up study of 63 patients who were diagnosed with CP/CPPS was performed. All patients were treated with electroacupuncture and injected with either 1 ml of HP or SP at CV1 as a standard treatment for 4 weeks. Thus, the patients were classified in two groups: HP (n = 32) and SP group (n = 31). Treatment was applied twice a week every third day for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the effect of pharmacopunture in both groups was compared using NIH-CPSI (National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index) and IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) before and after treatment. n n n n Results After treatment, the total NIH-CPSI scores were significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.01). Pain domain scores in both groups showed significant decrease (p < 0.01). In HP group, urination (p < 0.05) and quality of life (p < 0.01) scores reduced significantly. In SP group, impact score showed significant decrease (p < 0.05). However, impact score in HP group and urination and quality of life scores in SP group didn’t show any significance. IPSS score was reduced significantly after treatment in both groups (p < 0.05). p Conclusions These results suggest that pharmacopuncture and electroacupuncture treatment were effective on CP/CPPS. HP and SP didn't show any significant difference. However, it was also confirmed that HP is more favorable than SP to improve the symptoms of CP/CPPS. "
"The use of complementary and alternative medicine methods such as acupuncture in palliative care has increased over the past years. Well-planned trials are warranted to show its effectiveness in relieving distressing symptoms. The development of treatment schemes to be used in the trial for both acupuncture and medical symptom control is challenging, as both acupuncture and palliative care are highly individualized. Thus, standardized care plans of a randomized controlled trial will have difficulties in producing treatment results that compare to the clinical practice. As an alternative, treatment protocols for both acupuncture and medical symptom control of dyspnea, pruritus, hypersalivation, depression, anxiety, and xerostomia were designed with the input of experts. They are designed to provide sufficient symptom control and comparability for a three-arm, randomized controlled trial. Medical symptom control will be provided to all groups. The two control groups will be medical treatment and sham-laser acupuncture. "
"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired disease of the neuromuscular junctions characterized by muscular weakness and fatigue, with a prevalence of 50–125 cases per million population in western countries. In men, it usually appears after the age of 60 years, while in women, it usually appears before the age of 40 years. Long-term immunosuppression with corticosteroids is the mainstay treatment for patients with MG; however, the use of corticosteroids is a well-documented risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, which has also been reported in steroid-treated patients with MG. Here, a case of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a patient with MG who underwent 105 sessions of acupuncture delivered over 6 months is reported. After acupuncture treatment, the patient's fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, as well as the score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, were decreased. Furthermore, no adverse effects were observed. The findings in this clinical study are encouraging and provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing type 2 diabetes mellitus in a patient with MG. "
"The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of topical anesthesia and acupressure at the Yintang (Extra 1) and the Laogong (P-8) points on the severity of venipuncture pain among hospitalized 6–12-year-old children. A sample (n = 120) of 6–12-year-old hospitalized children was recruited from two teaching hospitals located in Rafsanjan, Iran. The children were allocated to the topical anesthesia, acupressure, and control groups. For children in the topical anesthesia and the acupressure groups, eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) cream and two-point acupressure were used, respectively, prior to performing venipuncture, whereas children in the control group only received routine prevenipuncture care. The severity of venipuncture pain was evaluated 5 minutes after performing venipuncture by using the Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, and Consolability behavioral pain assessment scale. The findings revealed that pain severity in both experimental groups was significantly lower than that in the control group, whereas there was no significant difference between the experimental groups regarding pain severity. Although acupressure was as effective as topical anesthesia cream in alleviating children's venipuncture pain, nurses are recommending to use acupressure instead of pharmacological pain management agents because of its greater safety, cost-effectiveness, and applicability."
"Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) initiate a series of molecular and cellular events in which inflammatory responses can lead to major neurological dysfunctions. The present study aims to investigate whether bee venom (BV) acupuncture applied at acupoints ST36 (Zusanli) and GV3 (Yaoyangquan) could minimize locomotor deficits and the magnitude of neural tissue losses, and change the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after an SCI by compression. Wistar rats were subjected to an SCI model by compression in which a 2-French Fogarty embolectomy catheter was inflated in the extradural space. The effects of BV acupuncture, in which 20 μL of BV diluted in saline (0.08 mg/kg) was injected at acupoints GV3 and ST36 [BV(ST36+GV3)-SCI] was compared with BV injected at nonacupoints [BV(NP)-SCI] and with no treatment [group subjected only to SCI (CTL-SCI)]. The BV(ST36+GV3)-SCI group showed a significant improvement in the locomotor performance and a decrease of lesion size compared with the controls. BV acupuncture at the ST36 + GV3 increased the expression of interleukin-10 (anti-inflammatory) at 6 hours and reduced the expression of interleukin-6 (proinflammatory) at 24 hours after SCI compared with the controls. Our results suggest that BV acupuncture can reduce neuroinflammation and induce recovery in the SCI compression model. Zusanli Zusanli "
"Acupuncture physicians have studied the application of reflexotherapy to cardiology. However, no one has investigated the connection of ancient Chinese diagnostic methods with modern tools. A total of 102 patients (54 men and 48 women) with heart pathology, namely, sick-sinus syndrome, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, and atrioventricular blockade, were studied using the usual instrumental methods (transesophageal electrophysiological study of the heart, echocardiography), after which they underwent Akabane thermopuncture testing as in traditional Chinese medicine. The results of cardio examination from one side of the Akabane test with that from the other side were compared by means of a multiple stepwise regression analysis. We revealed the effects on the characteristic pattern of acupuncture channel lesions inherent in a definite heart pathology, i.e., the most vulnerable acupuncture channel (AC), of such factors as disturbances of the contractile, conductive, or automatic heart functions, and changes in the chambers' size or circulation volume. Сhanges in the indices of the left and the right branches of these channels usually reflect the opposing natures of the changes in these indicators, which should be considered in reflexotherapy. The main value of the Akabane test along with the use of mathematical analysis lies in early, quick, and inexpensive detection of the above-mentioned heart disturbances. "
"Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is ranked the second leading cause of orofacial pain after toothache, and there is no effective standard treatment for all cases. Therefore, much research has been conducted in the therapeutic areas of TMD, such as acupuncture and electrotherapy, for this purpose. The aim of this research was to evaluate application of the neuromagnetic stimulator device Haihua model CD-9, used within the precepts of acupuncture in treating TMD-related pain symptoms and limited mouth opening. Analysis and discussion of this study were based on pain intensity index and range of mouth-opening evaluation before and after each session. Nine patients diagnosed with muscle TMD, referred by the surgery sector of Center Dental Specialties (CEO – I) in Piracicaba-São Paulo participated in this research. Considering the simplicity of the technique and good results obtained, use of this device is suggested as an additional therapeutic tool for relief of TMD symptoms. "
"Walnut hull (wal hull) is an agricultural by-product that is widely used in traditional medicine for alleviating pain and treating skin diseases, however, recently it has gained much attention in modern pharmacology due to its antioxidant properties. The current study was aimed to determine the total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin content of Persian wal hull extract and evaluate its biological effects on platelet function. Experimental data showed that acetone extract of wal hulls has a high content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant properties. The analytical study of crude extract by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry demonstrated different types of high- and low-molecular-weight compounds that are basically and biologically important. Moreover, an in vitro study revealed that wal hull extract at a concentration of 50 μg/mL inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and protein secretion by 50%, without any cytotoxic effects on platelets. The examined extract suppressed reactive oxygen species generation and also caspase activation in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Identically, N-acetylcysteine inhibited the increase of reactive oxygen species level induced by thrombin in platelets, and supported a link between cellular redox status and caspase activation in activated platelets. Presumably, the antiplatelet activity of wal hull extract is related to its polyphenolic compounds and their antioxidant properties. Therefore, wal hulls can be considered as a candidate for thrombotic disorders. in vitro in vitro "
"Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a complication of herpes zoster that can cause different types of pain in the affected area. It often occurs mainly in severe cases of herpes zoster. The problem is defined as a persisting pain for 90–120 days after relieving of acute phase of herpes lesions. This complication causes suffering in patients and reduces the quality of life. In western medicine’s viewpoints, PHN is due to disturbance in local and dermatomal nerves. There are several topical and systemic drugs that are used to manage the pain relief. In traditional medicine (TM), PHN is mostly due to incomplete heat and damp clearing in liver and spleen meridians, qi and toxic pathogens stagnation, accumulation of yin (blood stagnation in microcapillary), internal fire, and heat and obstruction of meridians. Acupuncture works based on the eradication of wind, clearing of heat, and destroying of damp by regulating qi and blood movement. In clinics, several methods of TM are used to relief PHN, such as simultaneous needling, surrounding needling, acupuncture, electro acupuncture, moxibustion, wet cupping or hijamat, and herbal medicine. In this review, we discussed all these methods and their role in reducing PHN and pain. "
"In Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture points (APs) have been emphasized as key elements that generate the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. At the spinal cord or supraspinal level, sensory neurons located in the dorsal horn receive an extensive supply of sensory information from skin and muscle receptors through peripheral afferent nerves. The stimulated skin area that influences the activity of a spinal sensory neuron is known as the peripheral receptive field (RF) of that neuron. By considering that a particular AP location involves the activation of one or various RFs, it can be assumed that several sensory central neurons are the site of convergence of the peripheral input generated by acupuncture stimulation. However, stimulation on nonacupoint sites could also activate skin areas with RFs that have been sensitized, and they could be involved in the generation of nonspecific effects of acupuncture, as seen in clinical practice. From the latter, it is suggested that effective APs, and even nonacupoints, are associated with a particular arrangement of RFs, and their study will be useful for understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of acupuncture and for the development and identification of more efficient sites and modes of acupuncture stimulation to evoke optimal therapeutic actions.

"Background Kelussia odoratissima Mozaff. (Apiaceae) is an edible, indigenous, and ethnomedicinal plant that grows only in Iran. Although antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of K. odoratissima have been reported, cytotoxic activity of this plant has not been investigated previously. Kelussia odoratissima K. odoratissima Kelussia odoratissima K. odoratissima Objective This study aims to evaluate the cytotoxicity of K. odoratissima leaf extract against a panel of human cancer cell lines. A secondary aim was to perform a phytochemical analysis of the plant’s leaf oil. K. odoratissima K. odoratissima Methods To extract the plant oil, dried leaves were subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for up to 3 hours. For the phytochemical analysis, essential oil was subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Plant extraction was performed by macerating leaf powder of K. odoratissima (50 g) in 70% methanol (500 mL) at room temperature (25–28°C) for 24 hours. To perform cytotoxicity assays, methanolic extract of K. odoratissima was tested against a panel of cell lines including MDA-MB468 (human breast cancer cell line), K562 (human leukemia cell line), SKOV3 (human ovarian cancer cell line), Y79 (human eye cancer cell line), A549 (lung cancer cell line), and HEK 293 (normal human embryonic kidney cell line). K. odoratissima K. odoratissima K. odoratissima K. odoratissima Results Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that sesquiterpens are dominant volatile components of the plant, followed by phthalides comprising 3-butyldine phthalide and 3-n-butyl phthalide, the latter compound being the major component of the leaf oil (25.1%). The leaf extract showed selective and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB468, K562, SKOV3, Y79, and A549 cancer cell lines with IC50 values (concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) of 85 μg/mL, 70 μg/mL, 120 μg/mL, 82 μg/mL, and145 μg/mL, respectively. n 50 n 50 Conclusions The present results suggest a direct cytotoxic activity of K. odoratissima leaf extract against human cancer cell lines. This activity of K. odoratissima may find application in combination with traditional herbal medicines to develop a new anticancer pharmacopuncture therapy.

"A protocol for a prospective single-blind parallel four-arm randomized placebo-controlled trial with repeated measures was designed to test the effects of various acupuncture methods compared with sham. Eighty self-selected participants with myofascial pain in the upper trapezius muscle were randomized into four groups. Group 1 received acupuncture to a myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the upper trapezius. Group 2 received acupuncture to the MTrP in addition to relevant distal points. Group 3 received acupuncture to the relevant distal points only. Group 4 received a sham treatment to both the MTrP and distal points using a deactivated acupuncture laser device. Treatment was applied four times within 2 weeks with outcomes measured throughout the trial and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks posttreatment. Outcome measurements were a 100-mm visual analog pain scale, SF-36, pressure pain threshold, Neck Disability Index, the Upper Extremity Functional Index, lateral flexion in the neck, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale, Working Alliance Inventory (short form), and the Credibility Expectance Questionnaire. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures were used to assess the differences between groups. "
"This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial to study the effectiveness of acupuncture on the perception of stress in patients who study or work on a large, urban college campus. The hypothesis was that verum acupuncture would demonstrate a significant positive impact on perceived stress as compared to sham acupuncture. This study included 111 participants with high self-reported stress levels who either studied or worked at a large, urban public university in the southwestern United States. However, only 62 participants completed the study. The participants were randomized into a verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. Both the groups received treatment once a week for 12 weeks. The Cohen's global measure of perceived stress scale (PSS-14) was completed by each participant prior to treatment, at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment completion. While participants of both the groups showed a substantial initial decrease in perceived stress scores, at 12 weeks post treatment, the verum acupuncture group showed a significantly greater treatment effect than the sham acupuncture group. This study indicates that acupuncture may be successful in decreasing the perception of stress in students and staff at a large urban university, and this effect persists for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment.

"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a widely-practiced method to increase blood flow in clinical practice. The best location for stimulation to achieve optimal blood flow has not yet been determined. We compared the effect of TENS application at sympathetic ganglions and acupuncture points on blood flow in the foot of healthy individuals. Seventy-five healthy individuals were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group received cutaneous electrical stimulation at the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglions. The second group received stimulation at acupuncture points. The third group received stimulation in the mid-calf area as a control group. Blood flow was recorded at time zero as baseline and every 3 minutes after baseline during stimulation, with a laser Doppler flow-meter. Individuals who received sympathetic ganglion stimulation showed significantly greater blood flow than those receiving acupuncture point stimulation or those in the control group (p < 0.001). Data analysis revealed that blood flow at different times during stimulation increased significantly from time zero in each group. Therefore, the application of low-frequency TENS at the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglions was more effective in increasing peripheral blood circulation than stimulation at acupuncture points. p p "
"There are few studies which attest the efficacy of acupuncture on treatment of sleep disturbs in Parkinson disease. The aimed of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on sleep disturbs of 22 patients with diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease (Hoehn–Yahr 1 to 3) who have assistance on the Pro-Parkinson Program of Clinical Hospital at Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil. All participants were evaluated by Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) before and after 8 weeks. The experimental group was submitted to 8 sections (once a week) which had duration of 30 minutes. The control group had no intervention. The intervention was executed using the acupuncture points LR3 (Taichong), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), LI4 (Hegu), TE5 (Wai-Guan), HT7 (Shenmen), PC6 (Neiguan), LI11 (Quchi), GB20 (Fengchi). Paired analyses were obtained by Wilcoxon test and independent analyses were made according to Mann–Whitney test. This study presented a potential therapeutic benefit of acupuncture on sleep disturbs of Parkinson's disease patients. This study showed a possible therapeutic benefit through acupuncture in sleep disorders in patients with PD. However, we propose new studies related to the effects of acupuncture on the clinical symptoms and evolution of the disease.

"Edema is an accumulation of an excessive amount of watery fluid in cells or intercellular tissues. In order to examine the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on edema, seven subjects were randomly divided into three groups, that was a Control group, an Acupuncture group (Acp), and an acupuncture and moxibustion group (Acp-Mox). After sitting for 60 minutes keeping their bodies still, the Acp and Acp-Mox subjects were administered acupuncture or acupuncture/moxibustion on the points of Zusanli (ST-36) and Sanyinjiao (SP-6), separately as against the Control group who only lied on the bed after modelization. After modelization at 60 minutes, the skin temperature and blood flow of all the groups were significantly lower in blood flow when compared with premodelization. But shortly after the procedure at 80 minutes, skin temperature in the Acp and Acp-Mox groups were significantly increased when compared with premodelization (vs. 60 minutes, p < 0.05). Moreover, the skin temperature and blood flow of the Acp-Mox group were significantly increased as compared to both the Control and the Acp group at the 80-minute time point. These results indicate that Acp and Mox-Acp could relieve edematous conditions significantly, especially the procedure of moxibustion with warming needle, was effective in improving edema which is often accompanied with cold intolerance and would be a recommended and superior therapy for edema.

"The objective of this study was to find out the effect of intravenous pharmacopuncture on hepatic recovery after partial hepatectomy in rats. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal group, control group, saline group, and two experimental groups. Except for those in the normal group, the rats underwent partial hepatectomy. Those in the control group did not receive any treatment. Those in the saline group received an intravenous injection with saline. Those in the two experimental groups received intravenous pharmacopuncture with SihoJigak-tang or DanchiSoyo-san extracts (10 mg/kg). Serum total bilirubin and liver regeneration rate were measured on Day 7 after partial hepatectomy. Intravenous pharmacopuncture with SihoJigak-tang significantly increased the liver regeneration rate, and intravenous pharmacopuncture with DanchiSoyo-san significantly decreased serum total billirubin after partial hepatectomy.

"Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication after most abdominal surgeries including cesarean section. It is associated with longer hospitalization and increased medical costs. This study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of acupressure, and low-cost noninvasive traditional treatment, on POI symptoms after cesarean section. A total of 120 patients were randomly divided into two groups; the treatment group received two sessions of acupressure (an hour after attending the women's division; and 3 hours after the first session), each lasting 20 minutes. The time of flatus and defecation, time to presence of bowel sounds, and duration of postoperative bed rest were monitored. Patients in the treatment group had a shorter time to presence of bowel sounds compared with those in the control group (p < 0.001), as well as shorter time to first passage of flatus (p < 0.001) and shorter postoperative bed rest (p = 0.005). However, the time to first defecation was not statistically significant (p = 0.311). Acupressure has potential positive impacts on attenuating POI symptoms after cesarean section, and can be used as a low-cost noninvasive nursing care to reduce POI incidence and intensity after cesarean section."
"Volume transmission is a new major communication signaling via extracellular fluid (interstitial fluid) pathways. It was proposed by the current authors that such pathways can explain the meridian phenomena and acupuncture effects. To investigate whether meridian-like structures exist in fish body and operate via volume transmission in extracellular fluid pathways, we injected alcian blue (AB) under anesthesia into Gephyrocharax melanocheir, which has a translucent body. The migration of AB could be seen directly and was recorded by a digital camera. The fish was then embedded and cut transversely to observe the position of tracks in three dimensions. Eight longitudinal threadlike blue tracks were recognized on the fish. The positions of these threadlike tracks were similar to meridians on the human body. Transverse sections showed that these tracks distributed to different layers of distinct subcutaneous loose connective tissues and intermuscular septa. Lymphatic vessels were sometimes associated with the extracellular blue tracks where the migration of AB occurred. Extracellular fluid pathways were found on fish through their transport of AB. These pathways operating via volume transmission appeared to be similar in positions and functions to the acupuncture meridians in Chinese medicine.

"Diabetes mellitus is a dangerous disease worldwide. Indonesia has 10 million diabetic and 17.9 million prediabetic citizens. Unfortunately, less than half of these diabetic individuals are aware of their conditions and less than 1% of those receiving medical treatment achieve their healing targets. Because acupressure is believed to be an effective treatment without the use of drugs, in this study we investigated acupressure as a comfortable and effective way of treating patients with diabetes mellitus. This pilot study involved 30 participants who were split into two groups: 15 each in the experimental and the control groups. The experimental group underwent acupressure at the Zusanli (ST-36) acupoint for 30 minutes per visit for 11 weeks, whereas the control group continued their regular treatment; participants in both groups had their blood glucose randomly checked weekly. Data were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation model; the result showed that the two groups were significantly different (p = 0.331 > α = 0.05; mean difference = 99.14; Bonferroni sig. p = 0.000 < α = 0.05) and that acupressure at ST-36 was effective in reducing blood sugar. This research showed that acupressure was an effective method for reducing blood glucose and was helpful for reducing complications due to diabetes."
"A previous study on rats showed that simultaneous acupuncture stimulation at the “Bai-Hui” (GV 20) and the “Yintáng” (Ex-HN3) acupoints alleviated the state of depression to an extent similar to that achieved by pharmacotherapy. This study investigated whether the alleviation of the depressed state required simultaneous acupuncture at these two acupuncture points. For the purposes of testing the effect of acupuncture on depressive symptoms, we treated a depression model rat, where depression had been induced by using a mild water-immersion stress technique, with either acupuncture stimulation at only one acupuncture point (GV 20 or Ex-HN3) or an antidepressant, and we measured the immobile time for evaluating the state of depression. Anxiety, as a symptom commonly associated with depression, was also evaluated by measuring the number of head dips. Neither the immobile time nor the number of head dips decreased upon acupuncture stimulation. From this study, single acupuncture stimulation at either “GV 20” or “Ex-HN3” alleviated neither the state of depression nor the anxiety. The water-immersion stress used to make the depression model rats was shown not to induce anxiety; however, the stress induced by immobilizing the rats for acupuncture stimulation did lead to anxiety.

"Traditional Chinese Medicine holds that acupuncture meridian activity is correlated with quality of function of specific organs. This study sets out to determine acupuncture meridian characteristics of subjects with moderate asthma distinguishing them from healthy subjects. Fifty asthma patients (age 35.36 ± 8.68 years) and fifty similarly aged (34.11 ± 7.29 years) healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Electrodermal conductances at Jing Well points were measured with Acugraph 4 and also Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) for the asthma group. All mean meridian conductances were lower for the asthma group, significance differences were in Lung and right Bladder meridians. In contrast, all but two of the standard deviations of group meridian conductances for the Asthma group were higher than those for the Healthy group. Difference in mean PEFR values between Asthma and Healthy groups was significant. These suggest that group measures of electrical conductance at Jing Well points can distinguish asthma from healthy individuals. The study provides support for the usefulness of meridian energy measurements to assess organ related dysfunction and for the idea that pathology groups exhibit higher standard deviations i.e. lower quality of regulation.

"This study conceptualizes the principle of agnihotra yajna. The perusal of ancient and modern literature reveals that the functioning of the human body is impossible without maintaining an energetic continuum driven by sunlight. The seven major chakras existing over the spinal cord help to maintain this energetic continuum. Agnihotra yajna is proposed to balance the chakra system as a whole by minimizing entropy. Offerings of natural elements to fire lit in a copper pyramid during agnihotra liberate various volatile compounds having potent pharmacological actions. Attempts were made to enhance the efficacy of fumes by incorporating two to three pieces of coconut endosperm and “navadhanya” (nine grains) to the conventional fire oblations. This investigation clearly demonstrates that the purpose behind the practice of agnihotra yajna is “letting incessant flow of energy (LIFE)” through our meridian lines and acupuncture points. The volatile organic compounds in smoke were analyzed using the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method, and the results are discussed. "
"The effects of isoquinoline alkaloid berberine (BER) on spleen tissue CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Here, BER was administered daily by intraperitoneal injection at doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg for 14 days. Following the exposure, mice spleen cellularities, IL-10 production by splenocytes, and spleen Treg/CD4+ cell profiles were studied in all the test groups of animals. The results showed that a high dose of BER (10 mg/kg) could decrease both the absolute and relative percentages of spleen Treg cells as well as decrease the production of IL-10 by splenocytes in the treated mice (p < 0.05). BER at 5 mg/kg did not appear to affect any of these parameters. Based on the finding here, it would seem that BER has effective immunostimulatory properties, which contradicts the results from other studies indicating immunosuppressive effects of BER. Depending on the doses of BER used, it might have a broad spectrum from immunosuppressive to stimulatory effects. Further studies, including more doses, are required to better evaluate the effects of this natural product. Mechanistic studies are required, particularly in case of redox state of the immune cells, to elucidate and determine how BER functions to impart the toxicity effects demonstrated here and in other studies. + + + reg reg + reg p + + + reg reg + reg p "
"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) develops in 30% of type 2 diabetes patients, increases the risk for foot ulcers and amputation, and is a significant source of disability and medical costs. Treatment remains challenging, propelling research to focus on therapeutic methods that aim to improve blood circulation or ameliorate oxidative stress that drives development of DPN. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for DPN symptoms and lower extremity arterial circulation in people with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-five patients seen at a Southern California Tribal Health Center who reported a threshold level of diabetic neuropathy symptoms in the lower extremities during the previous 4 weeks received acupuncture treatment once per week over a 10-week period between 2011 and 2013. The Neuropathy Total Symptom Scale (NTSS-6), Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS), and laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) were used for assessment at baseline and 10 weeks. A total of 19 of 25 study participants completed the study and reported a significant reduction in the NTSS symptoms of aching pain, burning pain, prickling sensation, numbness, and allodynia. Lancinating pain did not decrease significantly. LDF measures improved but not significantly. Acupuncture may effectively ameliorate selected DPN symptoms in these American Indian patients. "
"We previously showed that a yin meridian of the upper limb decreased electromyographic activity (root mean square) and muscle strength ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of stimulation. Here, we tested the upper trapezius (UT) muscle response after stimulation of a yang meridian of the upper limb, the small intestine (SI). Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were randomized into the following groups: UT muscle (SI14), distant of the UT muscle (SI8), without stimulation (CG), and sham (R3). An acupuncturist certificated by the Brazilian Society of Physical Therapists and Acupuncturists performed the needle insertion. Each volunteer received only one stimulation to the right upper limb. The evaluation occurred before, 5 minutes after, and 20 minutes after needle withdrawal. The root mean square activity increased on the right side in the UT muscle for the SI8 and SI14 groups (F3,37 = 4.67; p < 0.025) at the 20-minute evaluation. The most vigorous response occurred on the contralateral side because the effects were maintained for 5 minutes after withdrawal (F3,37 = 4.52; p < 0.025). Both groups showed an increase in the UT muscle strength at the 20-minute evaluation (F3,37 = 3.41; p < 0.025). The CG and R3 groups did not show any changes. Our data indicate that SI a yang meridian increases the UT muscle response."
"Introduction Acupuncture, a key part of traditional Chinese medicine, is used to relieve symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of needling CV-12 (Zhongwan) on blood glucose levels in healthy volunteers. Zhongwan Zhongwan Materials and methods Thirty-six individuals were recruited and randomized into either the acupuncture group or the placebo control group. The participants in the acupuncture group were needled at CV-12 (4 cun above the center of the umbilicus), and those in the placebo control group were needled at a nonexisting “sham” point on the right side of the abdomen (1 cun beside the CV-12)—a nonacupuncture point. For both groups, the needle was retained for 20 minutes without stimulation. Assessments were performed prior to and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16. cun cun cun cun Results The result of this study showed a mild reduction in random blood glucose (RBG) levels in the acupuncture group and a mild increase in RBG levels in the placebo control group. However, these changes were not statistically significant both within and between groups. Conclusion The result of this study suggests that although 20 minutes of needling at CV-12 without stimulation produced a mild reduction in RBG levels in healthy volunteers, it did not produce a statistically significant result.

"Intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV, respectively) are common complications of anesthesia with significant associated morbidity. Strategies for their prevention and treatment have been organized in pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures. Acupuncture at PC6 has demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials, although evidence regarding its efficacy in treating IONV and PONV has not yet been fully established. We present the case of a patient who underwent peripheral vascular surgery on a limb under a subarachnoid block and who developed IONV refractory to conventional pharmacological therapy. Acupuncture at the PC6 and the TF4 points proved to be an effective alternative treatment to conventional pharmacological treatment and resulted in almost immediate cessation of IONV. "
"Atopic dermatitis is known not to respond well to many clinical treatments. In this report, we present the case of an adult woman with atopic dermatitis who was effectively treated by using traditional Korean medicine (TKM). The patient was diagnosed with psoriasis based on lung dryness and heat and heart fire. The patient underwent acupuncture treatment based on the theory of Sa-Am acupuncture. Two meridians, the hand tai-yin meridian and the foot tai-yang meridian, were used to control lung dryness, lung heat, and heart fire. Using the LU9 and SP3 acupoints to tonify the hand tai-yin meridian, we could sedate lung dryness and heat, and using the BL67 acupoint to tonify the foot tai-yang bladder meridian, we could sedate heart fire. With this treatment, her symptoms completely disappeared in about 6 months. This case report provides a preliminary indication that TKM, especially Sa-Am acupuncture, can be effective for treating patients with psoriasis. Thus, further study is warranted. "
"Analgesic effects of acupuncture have been extensively studied in various clinical trials. However, the conclusion remains controversial, even among large scale randomized controlled trials. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the conclusion of the trials and the types of control used in those trials via systematic review. Published randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for pain were retrieved from electronic databases (Medline, AMED, Cochrane libraries, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, and CAB Abstracts) using a prespecified search strategy. One hundred and thirty-nine studies leading to 166 pairs of acupuncture-control treatment effect comparisons (26 studies comprised of 53 intervention-control pairs) were analyzed based on the proportion of positive conclusions in different control designs. We found that treatment effects of acupuncture compared with nontreatment controls had the highest tendency to yield a positive conclusion (84.3%), compared with nonneedle-insertion controls (53.3%). Whereas with needle-insertion controls, the lowest tendency of positive conclusions was observed (37.8%). Consistently, in studies reporting successful blinding, a higher tendency of positive findings on the treatment effect of acupuncture was found in the noninsertion sham controls compared with that in the insertion sham controls. We conclude that the type of control is likely to affect the conclusion in acupuncture analgesic trials. Appropriate control should be chosen according to the aims of studies.

"There remain more questions than answers regarding the manifestation of certain diseases, such as Ebola, in some otherwise healthy individuals but not in others. Sasang medicine offers a possible clue to solving this mystery by introducing a constitutionally based, intrinsic approach to determining disease susceptibility. The Sasang constitution is identified by a detailed examination of inherent physiological and psychological traits that are likely, but not yet, to be associated with specific genetic patterns. Hence, it is anticipated that after further examination, the Sasang model will contribute to the advancement of medical research and treatment by establishing genetically traceable psychological and physiological traits that contribute to, or offer protection against, various diseases. To progress along this journey, additional research involving Sasang-based organ-associated emotions and inherent emotional/physiological inclinations is warranted. This study presents an argument in favor of additionally examining constitutionally specific disease components related to viral epidemiology.

"Although acupuncture has existed for over 2000 years, its application as an anesthetic aid began in the 1950s in China. The first surgical procedure performed under acupuncture anesthesia was a tonsillectomy. Soon thereafter, major and minor surgical procedures took place with electroacupuncture alone providing the anesthesia. The procedures performed were diverse, ranging from cardiothoracic surgery to dental extractions. Usage of acupuncture anesthesia, specifically in neurosurgery, has been well documented in hospitals across China, especially in Beijing, dating back to the 1970s. We present a case of a 65-year-old man who presented with right-sided body weakness. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea requiring use of a nasal continuous positive airway pressure device during sleep. We performed a computed tomography brain scan, which revealed a left-sided acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage. Due to his multiple comorbidities, we decided to perform the surgical procedure under electroacupuncture anesthesia. The aim of this case report is to describe a craniotomy performed under electroacupuncture on an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities who was awake during the procedure and in whom this procedure, if it had been performed under general anesthesia, would have carried high risk.

"Although wet cupping has been a treatment for centuries, its mechanism of action is not well understood. Because the anatomical features of the wet-cupping area might play a role in its mechanism, we focus on the features of the interscapular area in which a common type of wet-cupping therapy (WCT), called Hijamat-e-Aam in Iranian medicine, is usually applied and discuss the possible relation of those features to the acupuncture meridians. We gathered and analyzed data from reliable textbooks on modern medicine with a focus on the anatomical features of the interscapular area, topics related to WTC in Iranian medicine, and acupuncture sources obtained by searching PubMed, Google-Scholar, and Science Direct. The interscapular area used for WCT was found to have special features: brown adipose tissue, immediate proximity to sympathetic ganglia, passage of the thoracic duct, two important acupuncture meridians, and proximity to the main vessel divisions carrying blood from the heart and the brain. These features indicate that the interscapular application of WCT not only discharges waste materials through a shifting of blood to the site after application of a traction force but also invigorates the body’s metabolism, increases immunity, and regulates blood biochemistry, which are desired therapeutic effects of WCT.

"In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy based on Verbal Pain Scale (VPS) scores in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients admitted to the emergency department with attacks of abdominal pain. This observational study was conducted in Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital between August 2014 and December 2014. Twenty patients admitted to the emergency department with FMF attacks were included in the study. Acupuncture therapy was applied to three points including LI4 (Hegu), ST25 (Tianshu), and Ren12 (Zhongwan). The VPS test was applied to the patients before and after the treatment. Average VPS scores were found to be 8.45 ± 0.75 before the treatment and 2.10 ± 0.85 after the treatment. The difference of the VPS scores before and after treatment was statistically significant (p = 0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of FMF attacks. Our results suggest that acupuncture therapy can be used as an effective treatment method in patients with FMF attacks. "
"The aim of this study was to compare the influences of manual acupuncture, laser acupuncture, and electromagnetic field stimulation on the autonomic nervous system. We monitored the heart rate variability before and after stimulation to check the influence on the autonomic nervous system. The heart rate variabilities at low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz) were analyzed to acquire LF/HF ratio. Xinshu (BL15) was selected as the stimulation point. Methods included manual acupuncture with a 1-cm depth and laser acupuncture at a wavelength of 660 nm and output power of 50 mW. An electromagnetic field of 2 Hz and 460 gauss (46 mT) was chosen. The LF and the LF/HF ratio were found to be lower in the manual acupuncture and the electromagnetic field groups, but to be higher in the laser acupuncture group. The HF was found to be lower in the laser acupuncture group, but higher in the manual acupuncture and the electromagnetic field groups. In conclusion, we found that manual acupuncture and electromagnetic field stimulation at BL15 activated the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas laser acupuncture at BL15 activated the sympathetic nervous system.

"Preemptive analgesia involves introducing an analgesic before noxious stimulation. Electroacupuncture (EA) activates descending mechanisms that modulate nociceptive inputs into the spinal dorsal horn. This study evaluated whether preoperative EA is more effective than postoperative EA in reducing incision pain in rats. The nociceptive threshold to mechanical stimulation was utilized to examine the effects of an intraperitoneal injection of saline (0.1 mL/kg) or naloxone (1 mg/kg) on antinociception induced by a 20-minute period of 2-Hz or 100-Hz EA applied to the Zusanli (ST36) and Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints before surgical incision, or 10 minutes after or 100 minutes after surgical incision of the hind paw. The extent of mechanical hyperalgesia after the incision was significantly attenuated by the application of 100-Hz EA preoperatively, but not by its application at 10 minutes or 100 minutes postoperatively. By contrast, 2-Hz EA was effective against postoperative hyperalgesia when applied 10 minutes or 100 minutes after surgery but not when it was applied preoperatively. Only the effect of 2-Hz EA applied 10 minutes after surgery was sensitive to naloxone. The present study showed for the first time that 100-Hz EA, but not 2-Hz EA, exerts a nonopioidergic preemptive effect against postincision pain in rats. "
"Natural products derived from plant sources have been utilized to treat patients with numerous diseases. The phytochemical constituents present in ethanolic leaf extract of Erythrina variegata (ELEV) were identified by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analyses. Shade dried leaves were powdered and extracted with ethanol for analyses through HPLC to identify selected flavonoids and through GC-MS to identify other molecules. The HPLC analysis of ELEV showed the presence of gallic and caffeic acids as the major components at concentrations of 2.0 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively, as well as other components. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 3-eicosyne; 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol; butanoic acid, 3-methyl-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenyl ester; phytol; 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diundecyl ester; 1-octanol, 2-butyl-; squalene; and 2H-pyran, 2-(7-heptadecynyloxy) tetrahydro-derivative. Because pharmacopuncture is a new evolving natural mode that uses herbal extracts for treating patients with various ailments with minimum pain and maximum effect, the results of this study are particularly important and show that ELEV possesses a wide range of phytochemical constituents, as indicated above, as effective active principle molecules that can be used individually or in combination to treat patients with various diseases.

"Cancer is the cause of more than 6 million deaths worldwide every year. For centuries, medicinal plants have been used in the treatment of cancer. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and acupuncture point stimulation are also used to treat cancer. The present study was intended to reveal the cytotoxic and anticancer potential of selected Cyathea species and to highlight their importance in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of cost-effective drugs. Cytotoxic studies using brine shrimp lethality bioassays and MCF 7 cell line cultures were carried out. Compared to petroleum ether, chloroform and acetone extracts, the ethanol extracts of selected Cyathea species were found to be more effective against brine shrimps. The ethanol extracts were further subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays. A decrease in cell viability and an increase in growth inhibition were observed for the MCF 7 cell line. The maximum percentage of cell inhibition was observed in Cyathea crinit, followed by Cyathea nilgirensis and Cyathea gigantea. The results of the present study suggest that Cyathea species are an effective source of cytotoxic compounds.

"Throughout the world, various parts of most Satureja species are traditionally used to treat patients with various diseases and complications. As for the presence of different classes of metabolites in Satureja and their numerous ethnomedical and ethnopharmacological applications, many species have been pharmacologically evaluated. The current work aimed to compile information from pharmacological studies on this savory for further investigations. The keyword Satureja was searched through Scopus and PubMed up to January 1, 2016. We found nearly 55 papers that dealt with the pharmacology of Satureja. We found that 13 species had been evaluated pharmacologically and that Satureja khuzestanica, Satureja bachtiarica, Satureja montana and Satureja hortensis appeared to be the most active, both clinically and phytopharmacologically. Regarding the content of rich essential oil, most evaluations were concerned with the antimicrobial properties. However, the antioxidant, antidiabetic and anticholesterolemic properties of the studied species were found to be good. In addition to the pharmacological activities that have been indentified for some species, opportunities still exist to assess the effectiveness of other well-known species. If different Satureja species are to have extensive ethnopharmacological applications, comprehensive assessments of the acute and chronic toxicities, as well as the teratogenicity, of those plants are needed."
"This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of acupuncture in the remission of depression. A depressive disorder model was induced by exposing Sprague–Dawley rats to chronic unpredictable stress. The rats were divided into five groups: healthy (blank group) and stressed rats (model group), and stressed rats treated with acupuncture (acupuncture group), riluzole (riluzole group), acupuncture combined with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injection (acupuncture + BTX-A group) or riluzole combined with BTX-A injection (riluzole + BTX-A group). Behavioral analysis showed significant differences in sucrose consumption, weight, and horizontal or vertical movements between the model and both the riluzole and acupuncture groups. No obvious differences between the riluzole + BTX-A and acupuncture + BTX-A groups were found. Moreover, no significance differences in glutamate content in the hippocampus were found among the riluzole + BTX-A, acupuncture + BTX-A and model groups (p > 0.05). Western blots and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were employed to detect protein and mRNA expressions of VGLUT2, SNAP25, VAMP1, VAMP2, VAMP7, and syntaxin1; no obvious differences among the riluzole + BTX-A, acupuncture + BTX-A and model groups were found. These data suggest that soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins are involved in the remission of depression in rats treated with acupuncture. p p "
"Although acupuncture treatment is increasingly in demand among psychiatric patients, to date no studies have investigated the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture (AA) in treating anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of AA versus progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), a standardized and accepted relaxation method. We examined 162 patients with a primary diagnosis of anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, and each patient chose between treatment with AA, executed according to the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association protocol, and treatment with PMR. Each group had treatments twice a week for 4 weeks. Before and after treatment, each participant rated four items on a visual analog scale: anxiety, tension, anger/aggression, and mood. Statistical analyses were performed with the original visual analog scale scores and the Change-Intensity Index, an appropriate indicator of the difference between two values of a variable. Our results show that treatment with AA significantly decreased tension, anxiety, and anger/aggression throughout the 4 weeks, but did not elevate mood. Between AA and PMR, no statistically significant differences were found at any time. Thus, we suggest that both AA and PMR may be useful, equally-effective additional interventions in the treatment of the above-mentioned disorders. "
"Neuronal stimulation improves physiological responses to infection and trauma, but the clinical potential of this strategy is unknown. We hypothesized that transdermal neural stimulation through low-frequency electroacupuncture might control the immune responses to surgical trauma and expedite the postoperative recovery. However, the efficiency of electroacupuncture is questioned due to the placebo effect. Here, electroacupuncture was performed on anesthetized patients to avoid any placebo. This is a prospective double-blinded pilot trial to determine whether intraoperative electroacupuncture on anesthetized patients improves postoperative recovery. Patients with electroacupuncture required 60% less postoperative analgesic, even they had pain scores similar to those in the control patients. Electroacupuncture prevented postoperative hyperglycemia and attenuated serum adrenocorticotropic hormone in the older and heavier group of patients. From an immunological perspective, electroacupuncture did not affect the protective immune responses to surgical trauma, including the induction of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10. The most significant immunological effect of electroacupuncture was enhancing transforming growth factor-β1 production during surgery in the older and lighter group of patients. These results suggest that intraoperative electroacupuncture on anesthetized patients can reduce postoperative use of analgesics and improve immune and stress responses to surgery."
"Chronic inflammation is known to be associated with visceral obesity and insulin resistance which are characterized by altered levels of production of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines. The dysregulation of the production of inflammatory adipokines and their functions in obese individuals leads to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and may promote obesity-linked metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis. Electroacupuncture (EA) was tested to see if there was a difference in its effect on pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokine levels in the blood serum and the white adipose tissue of obese Zucker fatty rats and high-fat diet-induced obese Long Evans rats. In the two rat models of obesity, on Day 12 of treatment, repeated applications of EA were seen to have had a significant differential effect for serum tumor necrosis factor-α, adiponectin, the adiponectin:leptin ratio, and blood glucose. For the adipose tissue, there was a differential effect for adiponectin that was on the borderline of significance. To explore these changes further and how they might affect insulin resistance would require a modification to the research design to use larger group sizes for the two models or to give a greater number of EA treatments.

"Since Bonghan Kim's discovery of the Bonghan system (BHS) in the 1960s, numerous reports have suggested that the system is fundamental for maintaining mammalian life. The BHS is a circulatory system independent of the blood or the lymphatic system, forms an extensive network throughout the entire mammalian body, has been reported to be the acupuncture meridian, stores distinct types of stem cells, and appears to have some roles in cancer metastasis. Despite Kim's first report having been published as early as 1962, research progress has been rather slow mainly because the system is very small and translucent, making it optically difficult to distinguish it from the hemoglobin-rich surrounding tissues. Unfortunately, Kim did not describe in detail the methods that he used for identifying and harvesting the system and the components of the system. In 2000, Kwang-Sup Soh reopened the BHS research, and since then, new and important scientific findings on the system have been reported, and many of Kim's results have been verified. In 2010, the BHS was renamed the primo vascular system. Nevertheless, good tools to properly deal with this system are still lacking. In this article, we address some of the technical difficulties involved in studying the primo vascular system and attempt to discuss potential ways to overcome those difficulties. "
"A predominant number of diseases affecting women are related to female hormones. In most of the cases, these diseases are reported to be associated with menstrual problems. These diseases affect female reproductive organs such as the breast, uterus, and ovaries. Estrogen is the main hormone responsible for the menstrual cycle, so irregular menstruation is primarily due to a disturbance in estrogen levels. Estrogen imbalance leads to various pathological conditions in premenopausal women, such as endometriosis, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, poly cysts, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, etc. In this review, we discuss common drug targets and therapeutic strategies, including acupuncture and compounds of natural origin, for the treatment of diseases caused by estrogen deficiency.

"In this clinical study, the author tried to prove that meridians, each having its own characteristics, exist in humans through which skin diseases can be treated. Three meridians, the hand tai-yin meridian, the hand tai-yang meridian, and the shao-yang meridian, were used to control lung dryness and heat and liver fire. By using the LU9 and SP3 acupoints to tonify the hand tai-yin meridian and the SI3 acupoint to tonify the hand tai-yang meridian, we could sedate lung dryness and heat, and by using the TW2 acupoint to sedate the hand shao-yang meridian, we could sedate liver fire. As psoriasis is known not to respond well to many clinical treatments, this report presents the case of an adult woman with psoriasis who was effectively treated using traditional Korean medicine (TKM). The patient was diagnosed with psoriasis based on lung dryness and heat and liver fire. Acupuncture and herbal medicine based on the theory of Sa-Am acupuncture were given to the patient. With this treatment, her symptoms completely disappeared in ∼14 months. This study gives a preliminary indication that TKM, especially Sa-Am acupuncture, can be effective for treating psoriasis. Thus, further study is warranted. "
"This study investigated experience with acupuncture needle stimulation of apparently healthy adult Nigerians and the responses of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and rate pressure products (RPP) to acupuncture at both real acupuncture points relevant to the treatment of cardiovascular disorder and sham acupuncture points not relevant to the treatment of cardiovascular disorder. Seventy-eight participants were randomly placed into three groups: the real acupuncture group (RAG); the sham acupuncture group (SAG); and the control group, with 26 participants per group. Data were collected preintervention, 15 minutes into acupuncture stimulation, postintervention, and 15 minutes after intervention. Changes (postintervention − preintervention scores) in the SBP, HR, and RPP were statistically lower in the RAG than in the SAG. Changes in the DBP showed a significant difference between the SAG and the RAG (p > 0.05). Findings from this study showed that among apparently healthy Nigerian adults, acupuncture needle stimulation at acupoints relevant to cardiovascular disorders was more effective than sham intervention in reducing the SBP, HR, and RPP. Participants reported heaviness, numbness, and increasing pain, but no dizziness, fainting and/or life-threatening side effects, during and after the acupuncture needle stimulation. p p "
"A varicocele is a dilatation of the pampiniform venous plexus within the spermatic cord. The incidence of varicoceles is 15%, and it occurs in more than 40% of men in infertile couples. Traditional Korean medicine (TKM) has been used to treat male infertility in Korea. We present two cases of men with varicoceles diagnosed via physical examination and scrotal thermography. We treated these men for two months by using TKM techniques, which included acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, and herbal medicine. We used scrotal thermography to evaluate the varicoceles before and after TKM treatment. After TKM treatment, the scrotal thermoregulation of both patients improved. In Patient 1, the temperature difference between the left and the right pampiniform plexus (i.e., ΔTP) was 2.8°C before treatment. It decreased to 1.3°C after treatment. In addition, the temperature difference between the testicles (ΔTT) was 1.5°C before treatment; it decreased to 0.2°C after treatment. In Patient 2, the ΔTP was 1.5°C before treatment; it decreased to 0.2°C after treatment. This report is the first to show that TKM may be an option for treating patients with varicoceles, as determined by using a scrotal thermography evaluation. via via "
"A tuberosity fracture is an avulsion fracture in an area 1.5 cm proximal to the fifth metatarsus. Six to eight weeks of immobilization may be required. A patient with a short leg plaster splint came to our clinic because of pain. The patient had a diagnosis of a fifth metatarsus fracture. Significant edema, fluctuation on the dorsolateral section of the left foot, and red color changes (0.2- to 0.3-cm diameter) on the skin of the anterolateral tibial area of the affected leg were noted. The locations of these skin changes corresponded to the GB34 (Yanglingguan) and the ST37 (Shanqiuxu) acupoints. The patient was successfully treated with acupuncture at these and several other acupoints. After 3 weeks (i.e., eight sessions), the patient returned to her routine life without any pain. This interesting case of metatarsus proximal end fracture shows that some acupoints may be visible during the progress of the disease. We used these acupoints in acupuncture treatment. Pain and edema were rapidly relieved, which may be attributable to the recovery of the lymphatic system in the affected area via acupuncture treatment. via via "
"Acupuncture has been studied for several decades to establish evidence-based clinical practice. This systematic review aims to evaluate evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in influencing the functional connectivity of the central nervous system in patients with musculoskeletal pain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify studies in which the central response of acupuncture in patients with musculoskeletal pain was evaluated by neuroimaging techniques. Databases searched were AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PEDro, Pubmed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscuss, and Web of Science. Included studies were assessed by two independent reviewers for their methodological quality by using the Downs and Black questionnaire and for their levels of completeness and transparency in reporting acupuncture interventions by using Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) criteria. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four studies were nonrandomized controlled trials (NRCTs). The neuroimaging techniques used were functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Positive effects on the functional connectivity of the central nervous system more consistently occurred during long-term acupuncture treatment. The results were heterogeneous from a descriptive perspective; however, the key findings support acupuncture's ability to alter pain-related functional connectivity in the central nervous system in patients with musculoskeletal pain.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control, group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression. "
"Electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to exert beneficial effects on obesity, but the mechanism is unclear. This study investigated the effects of EA on diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. Fifty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into low-fat diet (LFD, 10 rats) and high-fat diet (HFD, 40 rats) groups. After the DIO models had been established, successful model rats were randomly divided into HFD, EA, and orlistat (OLST) groups. The EA group received EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Quchi (LI11) for 20 minutes once per day for 28 days. The OLST group was treated with orlistat by gavage. The body weight, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, adipocyte diameters, and neuroprotein Y/agouti-related protein and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B levels were significantly lower in the EA group than in the HFD group. The rats of the OLST group showed watery stools and yellow hairs whereas those of the EA group had regular stools and sleek coats. The effect of EA on weight loss may be related to improved insulin resistance caused by changes in the adipocyte size and by reductions in the expressions of neuroprotein Y/agouti-related protein and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. This study indicates that EA may be a better method of alternative therapy for treating obesity and other metabolic diseases. Zusanli Quchi Zusanli Quchi "
"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a major cause of debilitation in adults, and acupuncture is a recommended treatment. We assessed the effect of acupuncture on pain and quality of life in patients with LSS. Twenty-four patients with LSS who had symptoms of neurogenic claudication were randomly selected and underwent 10 sessions of acupuncture. Pain and quality of life were evaluated before and immediately after the intervention and 6 weeks later using a visual analogue scale and Short Form-36 Health Survey. Paired t tests and repeated measure tests were used to analyze the data. The mean age of the patients was 48.2 ± 10.8 years. The mean visual analogue scale scores before and immediately after intervention (7.9 ± 1.3 and 4.3 ± 2.1) were statistically different (p < 0.001), as was the mean score (3.08 ± 2.3) 6 weeks later (p = 0.01). Five aspects of the Short Form-36 Health Survey score were associated with significant improvements immediately after acupuncture (p < 0.05). Comparisons of the scores before and 6 weeks after intervention showed significant improvements in emotions, vitality, general health, bodily pain, and physical well-being. Therefore, acupuncture had a significant short-term effect on pain and quality of life in patients with LSS."
"Acupuncture points have a notable characteristic in that they have a higher density of mast cells (MCs) compared with nonacupoints in the skin, which is consistent with the augmentation of the immune function by acupuncture treatment. The primo vascular system, which was proposed as the anatomical structure of the acupuncture points and meridians, also has a high density of MCs. We isolated the primo nodes from the surfaces of internal abdominal organs, and the harvested primo nodes were stained with toluidine blue. The MCs were easily recognized by their stained color and their characteristic granules. The MCs were classified into four stages according to the degranulation of histamine granules in the MCs. Using conventional optical microscopes details of the degranulation state of MCs in each stage were not observable. However, we were able to investigate the distribution of the granules on the surfaces of the MCs in each stage, and to demonstrate the height profiles and three-dimensional structures of the MCs without disturbance of the cell membrane by using the scanning ion conductance microscopy.

"Several studies have revealed that among foods, the consumption of edible nuts has beneficial effects on health which are attributed to their high content of potent antioxidants. Among nuts, the whole seed of the almond (Prunus dulcis) has been demonstrated to possess potent free radical scavenging activity, which is related to the presence of phenolic compounds. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the polyphenol content and the antioxidant ability of almond hull, which is an agriculture solid waste. The present results revealed that among different extraction methods, the acetone extract of almond hulls has a high content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds and a high antioxidant ability, which were determined by using the phosphomolybdenum method and by measuring the potency of the antioxidant, respectively. Moreover, the experimental data disclosed that the acetone extract of almond hulls provides protection against the oxidative damage and the membrane protein degradation that are caused in human erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide. These phenomena may likely be due to the recruitment of antioxidants by cell membranes and/or translocation to cytosol. Overall, almond hull extract could be considered as a natural source of antioxidants, and its consumption could have a positive effect on human health. Prunus dulcis Prunus dulcis "
"Until recently, the primo vascular system (PVS) has been unnoticed by most anatomists due to the small diameter and translucent features of the threadlike network. These properties make primo vessels (PVs) difficult to visualize for harvest and for further characterization. One particular PVS subtype that is located within the lymphatic vessels (LVs) is of strong interest because with a proper contrast, these long PVs can be visualized through the transparent LV wall and can be harvested to provide sufficient sample material for analysis. The most common method to visualize this PVS subtype utilizes Alcian blue as the contrast agent. This technique is effective, but tedious, and has relatively low repeatability. The purpose of this study was to develop a new technique that allows reliable visualization of the intralymphatic PVS (IL-PVS) in a user-friendly manner. The method was designed to provide optical contrast to the PVS by taking advantage of the porous nature of the PV's external wall and interstitial matrix. Turquoise-green-colored hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs) in the size range of 50–125 nm were found to provide excellent optical contrast for the IL-PVS in rats. The PVS was visualized within 10 minutes after HGN administration at a 95% success rate. "
"Obesity is the state of excessive body fat accumulation and is mainly caused by consuming more calories than are burned through physical activity. Herbal acupuncture (HA), also known as pharmacopuncture, has been increasingly used in clinics of Korean medical to alleviate obesity. This review analyzed four clinical studies and 16 animal studies on the effectiveness of HA as a treatment for obesity. Clinical evidence suggests that various kinds of HA might be beneficial for treating obesity; however, further investigations with well-designed, evidence-based, randomized clinical trials are needed. Animal studies support the idea that HA might be beneficial for the treatment of obesity and provide possible mechanisms, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, modulating lipid metabolism and so on, to explain the effect of HA on obesity. This review, based on the evidence collected, suggests that HA could have a beneficial effect for alleviating obesity by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, leptin, and the insulin signal.

"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of acupotomy for treating patients with a herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD). This case series includes five HIVD patients who were treated at the Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Daejeon University Dunsan Korean Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, from January 2015 to April 2015. Acupotomy was performed three times over a 2-week period, along with Korean medical treatment. The outcomes were evaluated by using a numeric rating scale (NRS), physical examination, the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI), the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36), and the Surgical Safety Checklist. The NRS and physical examination results, as well as the ODI scores, were improved in all cases. No significant differences were noted on the SF-36. No patients had any adverse effects. This study, with its findings of encouraging responses in reducing low back pain and radiating pain and in recovering the kinetic state of soft tissue, supports the potential use of acupotomy for the treatment of patients suffering from HIVD.

"Nowadays, acupuncture is widely used to manage pain, and childbirth is a condition requiring appropriate pain management interventions. The efficacy of acupuncture in the management of labor pain has recently been studied, but the results are not satisfactory and conflicts exist. In this study, we investigated the effects of acupuncture on labor pain, serum cortisol level, and duration of labor. We conducted a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial that included 63 nulliparous women: 32 in the study group and 31 in the control group. Acupuncture was performed at the SP-6 and the LI-4 points in the study group, and sham acupuncture was performed at the same points in the control group. Pain scores and serum cortisol levels were measured before and after the intervention. Changes in these measures and in the duration of labor were compared between the groups. No significant variations in pain scores or serum cortisol levels were observed between the two control groups. However, the duration of labor was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the group receiving real acupuncture. Our results show that acupuncture is significantly associated with a decreased duration of labor, even though it was no better than a placebo for the treatment of labor pain. p p "
"Pain behavior and awareness are characterized by heightened alertness and anxiety, which begin to disappear as soon as the curative process starts. The present study aimed to quantify c-fos expression in rat spinal cords and brains after a surgical stimulus and with preoperative or postoperative acupuncture. Animals were randomly divided into preoperative and postoperative groups and were then further divided into control, manual acupuncture (MA), or electroacupuncture (EA) groups. Expression of c-fos was quantified using immunohistochemistry. The collected data were analyzed using the t test at a 5% probability level. Presurgery and postsurgery spinal cord c-fos expressions were similar in all of the treatment groups. In the control rats, c-fos expression was higher before surgery than after surgery, contradicting the expected outcome of acupuncture and preemptive analgesia. After treatment, the expression of c-fos in the brains of the rats in the MA and the EA groups was reduced compared with that of the rats in the control group. These findings suggest that acupuncture used as preemptive analgesia in rats is a useful model for studying its application in human treatment. t t "
"Pain is an enormous and prevalent problem that troubles people of all ages worldwide. The effectiveness of acupuncture for pain management has been strongly verified by large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Increasing numbers of patients with pain have accepted acupuncture treatment worldwide. However, some challenges exist in establishing evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture. A more applicable and innovative research methodology that can reflect the effect of acupuncture in the settings of daily clinical practice needs to be developed. "
"This study investigated whether a meridian-like distribution of Alcian blue (AB) existed after it was injected into a fish's body and suggested a new animal model for meridian study. Twenty Gephyrocharax melanocheir fish with translucent bodies were injected with AB at a point near the spinal column or the dorsal fin. Distribution of AB was observed using a digital camera and a stereomicroscope. Three or more obvious blue tracks were found: one along the spinal column, another along the posterior margin of the abdomen extending to the superior margin of the anal fin, and a third along both sides of the dorsal fin. They were similar to the locations of the governor, conceptual vessel, and urinary bladder meridians, respectively, on the human body according to the classic theory of traditional Chinese medicine. A few other blue tracks were also found, which apparently did not correspond to any known meridians. The results show that the tracks of AB share important similarities with the locations of classically described meridians and that they are mainly distributed in the interstitial space around bones and blood vessels and inside muscular interstices. This study may provide a new experimental animal model for exploring acupuncture meridians. Gephyrocharax melanocheir Gephyrocharax melanocheir "
"Acupuncture induces physiological changes, and patients have reported warm or cool sensations with “Burning Fire” (BF) or “Penetrating Cool” (PC) manipulations. This study aimed to evaluate whether these techniques had distinct effects on skin temperature and blood flow and to examine whether skin temperature correlated with blood flow. The participants were 25 healthy volunteers, each receiving acupuncture manipulations on points LI4 and LI11 bilaterally. Skin temperatures and blood flow were recorded continuously on both arms. The study found that acupuncture significantly increased skin temperature on the needling arm by 0.3514°C on average, but decreased it on the contralateral arm by 0.2201°C on average. Blood flow decreased significantly in both arms during needling (−3.4% and −5.97% for the ipsilateral and the contralateral sides, respectively), but the changes in skin temperature did not correlate with the changes in blood flow. Furthermore, these changes were not significantly different between acupuncture techniques and acupuncture points. In conclusion, acupuncture changes local skin temperature and blood flow independent of the manipulation technique. Moreover, blood flow may not be affected by the increased temperature on the needling arm. These results help to verify traditional Chinese medicine concepts and may help in establishing standards for acupuncture treatments. "
"We used for the first time a vascular casting material to take advantage of a simple tracing procedure and to isolate the peculiar features of acupuncture point injections. The polymer Mercox was injected into the skin of a dead mouse at acupuncture points along the bladder meridian lines. After a partial maceration of the whole body with a potassium-hydroperoxide solution, we anatomized it under a stereomicroscope to trace the injected Mercox. Many organs were checked to determine whether or not they contained some Mercox tracing. Connections between the injection sites along the acupuncture points were observed. Two to three layers of Mercox in a plate shape were found under the skin at the acupuncture points, and Mercox travelled throughout the adipose tissue, the fascia, and the parietal and visceral serous membranes inside the organ's parenchyma. The casting material Mercox used with a modified partial maceration procedure is a promising method for visualizing the routes of the meridian system and the primo vascular system. The routes for Mercox are different from those of the blood and lymphatic vessels. "
"Chronic inflammation is known to be associated with visceral obesity and insulin resistance and is characterized by altered levels of production of adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major and escalating public health and clinical challenge worldwide, and patients with MetS have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Electroacupuncture (EA) was tested as a means of decreasing inflammation in genetically obese Zucker fatty rats, which serve as a model of MetS. Repeated application of EA at the Zhongwan/Guanyuan acupoints decreased serum TNF-α, but produced no significant alterations in serum leptin, adiponectin, or IL-10. EA had no significant effect on the levels of these four adipokines in white adipose tissue. These findings are consistent with the supposition that EA inhibits proliferation and/or infiltration of macrophages into the adipose tissue of obese rats and stimulates the release of IL-10 from the decreased numbers of macrophages present in adipose tissue. Compared with the control animals, no significant change in body weight occurred. The blood glucose (BG) level over a 30-minute interval in Week 2 was relatively the same as that in Week 1, suggesting that EA treatment does not increase the likelihood of developing hyperglycemia. "
"The effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines and blood glucose (BG) in lean and obese Long Evans rats were investigated. Group 1 and Group 3 had five lean and seven obese rats, respectively, and received EA at the Zhongwan/Guanyuan acupoints on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 10, and Day 12. Group 2 and Group 4, with five lean and seven obese rats, respectively, did not undergo EA. After induction of anesthesia, BG was measured at 10 minutes and 20 minutes. EA was applied for 30 minutes, and BG was measured again. At the end of the study, blood and white adipose tissue were collected. Analyses showed that for all groups, the mean BG at 20 minutes (baseline) and 50 minutes were significantly greater on Day 1 than on any other day. Compared with Group 2, the baseline BG in Week 1 for Group 1 was significantly lower, but Groups 3 and 4 showed no difference. Group 1 had significantly higher serum interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α than Group 2, while Group 3's serum leptin was greater than Group 4's. White adipose tissue interleukin-10 and adiponectin:leptin ratio were higher for Group 1 than Group 2. EA affected no significant differences in any other components measured for lean and obese animals. "
"Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological symptom reported by women and constitutes a high health, social, and economic burden. Chemotherapies, along with their side effects, have not yielded satisfactory outcomes. Alternative nonpharmacological interventions, including acupuncture and acupressure, have been advocated, but evidence regarding their beneficial effect is inconclusive. This study sought to obtain evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture and acupressure interventions. Twelve electronic databases were searched by using menstrual pain intensity and quality of life as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, with the PEDro guideline for quality appraisal. Data unsuitable for a meta-analysis were reported as descriptive data. The search yielded 38 citations, from which eight studies were systematically reviewed, four of the eight being eligible for meta-analysis. The systematic review showed moderate methodological quality with a mean of 6.1 out of 10 on the PEDro quality scale. Acupressure showed evidence of pain relief while acupuncture improved both the mental and the physical components of quality of life. In conclusion, physiotherapists should consider using acupuncture and acupressure to treat primary dysmenorrhea, but a need exists for higher quality, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trials with adequate sample sizes to establish clearly the effects of these modalities.

"The therapeutic strategy against autism, a severe neurological development disorder, is one of the challenges of this decade. Recent findings show that oxidative stress plays a crucial role on the pathophysiology of autism, and laser acupuncture at Shenmen (HT7) can improve oxidative status in many neurological disorders. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of laser acupuncture at HT7 on behavior disorders and oxidative stress status in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of the valproic acid rat model of autism. Laser acupuncture was performed once daily during postnatal day (PND) 14–PND 40. Behavioral tests including rotarod, open-field, learning and memory, and social behavior tests were performed during PND 14–PND 40. At the end of study, brain oxidative status including malondialdehyde levels and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were determined in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Laser acupuncture at HT7 significantly improved autistic-like behaviors. Decreased malondialdehyde levels were observed in all areas mentioned above, however, increased glutathione peroxidase activity was observed only in the striatum and hippocampus. No changes in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were observed in any investigated area of the brain. Therefore, our study suggests that laser acupuncture at HT7 partly mitigates autistic-like symptoms via improved oxidative status. "
"For tracking the primo vascular system, we observed the primo vessels in vivo in situ using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response in the lymphatic vessels of a rabbit. Injection of LPS (200 μg/kg) into the lymph nodes resulted in greatly stained primo vessels, which were swollen in some cases. We were able to obtain comparative images through alcian blue and diaminobenzidine staining, which clearly showed different morphologies of the primo vessels. The mechanism causing the response of the primo vessels to the injected LPS is still unclear; however, these results might be a first attempt at giving an explanation of the function of the primo vascular system and identifying the changes in the structure and function of the primo vascular system in response to an external stimulus such as an injection of LPS. in vivo in situ in vivo in situ "
"The acupuncture meridian system (AMS) is the key concept of Traditional Chinese Medical Science (TCMS). It is a natural network formed by the tissue space that connects human viscera and skin. In this article, a new hypothesis that the AMS is an auxiliary respiratory system is presented. The AMS collects the CO2 that is produced by tissue supersession and that cannot be excreted via blood circulation, and discharges the CO2 through the body's pores, thus preventing a pressure increase in the internal environment. Thus, local blood circulation will not be blocked, and the body will remain healthy. In addition to neuroregulation and humoral regulation, AMS regulation is an important method of physiological regulation. Furthermore, the pathological principle of the AMS, therapies of TCMS, and the excellent future of the AMS are discussed."
"In this article, we aim to enlighten practitioners and patients involved with acupressure beads and to contribute to their safer use by reporting a unique case of insidious intrusion of an acupressure bead into the eustachian tube. A metallic object was found in the eustachian tube of a patient while conducting a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. The object was later confirmed to be an auricular acupressure bead, and was successfully removed by performing a tympanoplasty and a canal wall down mastoidectomy. The bead was assumed to have passed through an existing perforation of the tympanic membrane. According to previously published literature, tympanic membrane perforations exist in ∼1% of the population. Therefore, middle-ear foreign bodies are relatively common occurrences for otolaryngologists. However, metallic objects such as acupressure beads are especially important in the sense that they can cause severe burns during MRI. To avoid potential complications, acupressure-bead practitioners should be aware of the possibility that intrusions through the tympanic membrane could go unnoticed. "
"A previous study demonstrated that acupuncture at ST36 (Zu-San-Li) attenuates ethanol withdrawal (EW)-induced hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis in rats. The current study investigated the involvement of hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) in that process. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with 3 g/kg/d of ethanol or saline for 28 days. After 24 hours of EW, acupuncture was applied to rats at bilateral ST36 points or at nonacupoints (tail) for 1 minute. A high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that EW significantly increased both the NE and the 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Western blot analysis also revealed that EW markedly elevated the phosphorylation rates of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), but spared TH protein expression in the PVN. However, acupuncture at ST36, but not at nonacupoints, greatly inhibited the increase in the hypothalamic NE, MHPG, and phosphorylation rates of TH. Additionally, postacupuncture infusion of NE into the PVN significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of acupuncture at ST36 on the oversecretion of plasma corticosterone during EW. These results suggest that acupuncture at ST36 inhibits EW-induced hyperactivation of the hypothalamic NEergic system to produce therapeutic effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. "
"The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of autonomic nerve pharmacopuncture (ANP) treatment on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with advanced cancer. This observational case study was conducted at the East West Cancer Center of Daejeon University's Dunsan Korean Medical Hospital. Two patients were observed. One patient was diagnosed with left thymic cancer metastatic to the left pleura. The other patient had terminal-stage cervical cancer with iliac bone and lumbar 5 metastases. We injected mountain ginseng pharmacopuncture (MGP) into acupoints alongside the spine (Hua-Tuo-Jia-Ji-Xue, EX B2). We examined the patients for CRF using the Korean version of the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (RPFS-K), which is a self-assessment tool. The scores on the RPFS-K for both patients tended to decrease during the treatment. Laboratory findings, including hematological changes, were also checked. Liver and renal function tests showed that the treatment was safe. Although further large-population studies are necessary, this case study suggests that ANP has a favorable effect on CRF in patients with advanced cancer. "
"Acupuncture and pharmacopuncture have been shown to be effective in tumor treatment. However, their effectiveness for treating oligodendroglioma has not been reported yet. The purpose of this study was to provide an initial report on the effectiveness of acupuncture and pharmacopuncture for the treatment of an oligodendroglioma by presenting a case that was treated successfully. A 54-year-old man, who had experienced intracranial hemorrhage, was diagnosed with recurrent oligodendroglioma. His expected survival period was 3–6 months. The patient received daily acupuncture and weekly pharmacopuncture of mountain ginseng and bee venom. After treatment for 18 months, the tumor size was decreased markedly on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and severe seizures had disappeared. In this case, a combination of acupuncture and pharmacopuncture was shown to be effective for the treatment of recurrent oligodendroglioma. "
"Acupuncture is increasingly offered as a treatment option for managing cancer-related symptoms. In addition to randomized controlled trials, patient-reported outcomes may be needed to establish treatment effectiveness. This study retrospectively examined the symptoms and the satisfaction ratings of 90 patients receiving acupuncture at an integrative oncology clinic. At least two acupuncture sessions were completed by 72% of the sample. The prevalence rates of fatigue, pain, anxiety, physical distress, emotional distress, and poor quality of life before acupuncture were > 62%. Paired t tests revealed a significant reduction in symptoms from baseline until after the first acupuncture session and after the last session (p < 0.05). Fewer (21%) patients reported nausea, which was significantly reduced after the first session, but not the last session. Reductions represented clinically meaningful differences in 33–41% of patients after the first session and in 41–53% of patients after the last session for all symptoms, except nausea. A small subset of patients (0–8%) reported worsening symptoms after acupuncture. The majority were satisfied with the service. The results of this study suggest that acupuncture may be useful as an adjunct treatment for cancer symptom management. While high-quality trials are still needed to establish the treatment's efficacy, patients may benefit from these primarily safe, low-cost services. t p t p "
"Previous studies revealed that acupuncture suppressed both morphine self-administration and morphine-seeking behavior after abstinence. Based on these results, this study examined whether acupuncture attenuated morphine-craving under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule and investigated the possible neuronal mechanism. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer morphine (0.5 mg/kg) at a fixed ratio for 9 days, and rats who achieved stable infusion were switched to a PR schedule. When animals had taken no more morphine for 1 hour, the number of infusions was defined as the break point (BP). After PR training, animals that had established a stable BP received acupuncture the next day. Acupuncture was applied for 1 minute immediately before the test session. Bicuculline (1.0 mg/kg) and SCH 50911 (2.0 mg/kg) were given 30 minutes prior to acupuncture. The c-Fos levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were examined. Acupuncture at SI5 reduced the BP significantly. Moreover, the effects of acupuncture were blocked by either bicuculline or SCH 50911. Immunofluorescence revealed that acupuncture at SI5 decreased c-Fos expressions in the VTA and the NAc. This study demonstrates that acupuncture at SI5 is effective for the treatment of morphine-craving and that this effect is mediated via the GABA pathway. "
"Mast cells (MCs) play a major role in allergic reactions. Surprisingly, the acupuncture points have a higher density of MCs compared with nonacupoints in the skin, which is consistent with the augmentation of the immune function by acupuncture treatment. We hypothesized that the primo vascular system (PVS), which was proposed as the anatomical structure of the acupuncture points and meridians, should have a high density of MCs. In order to test that hypothesis, we investigated the primo nodes isolated from the surfaces of internal organs, such as the liver, the small and the large intestines, and the bladder. The harvested primo nodes were stained with toluidine blue, and the MCs were easily recognized by their red–purple stains and their characteristic granules. The results showed a high density of MCs in the primo nodes and confirmed the hypothesis. The MCs were uniformly distributed in the nodes. The relative concentration of the MCs with respect to other cells was ∼15%. We divided the sizes of the primo nodes into three classes: large, medium, and small. The number density and the relative concentration of MCs did not show a size-dependence. The current work suggests that the PVS may participate in the immune response to allergic inflammation, which closely involves MCs. "
"Acupuncture may help treat specific cancer-related symptoms. Here, we summarize our clinical trials that sought to determine acupuncture's role in managing cancer-related symptoms. Trials have been conducted to determine acupuncture's ability to mitigate cancer-related symptoms including dyspnea, fatigue, xerostomia, lymphedema, hot flashes, postoperative ileus, pain and dysfunction after neck dissection, and postthoracotomy pain. Published studies indicate that acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture failed to reduce cancer-related dyspnea. Both true and sham acupuncture alleviated fatigue slightly, but no significant differences between groups emerged. Compared with sham acupuncture, our research showed that acupuncture significantly improved saliva production in patients with xerostomia and significantly reduced lymphedema patients' arm circumference in a pilot study. However, acupuncture failed to significantly reduce hot flashes and was no more successful than sham acupuncture in reducing postoperative ileus. Significant reductions in pain and dysfunction occurred in cancer patients after neck dissection. In a feasibility study, acupuncture was found to be acceptable to lung cancer patients and did not interfere with standard postoperative care. In summary, acupuncture is a potential candidate for the treatment of some important cancer-related symptoms. Large clinical trials and research to investigate mechanistic pathways are warranted. "
"Recently, ginger has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as an herbal therapy for treating several cardiovascular diseases, however, information on its mechanism of action is limited. The present study assessed the effect of two ginger varieties (Zingiber officinale and Curcuma longa) on the arginase activity, atherogenic index, levels of liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), and plasma lipids in rats fed with a high-cholesterol (2%) diet for 14 days. Following the treatment period, it was found that feeding a high-cholesterol diet to rats caused significant (p < 0.05) increases in arginase activity, atherogenic index, levels of TBARS, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with a concomitant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). However, both ginger and turmeric (2% and 4%) caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in arginase activity and the atherogenic index, and prevented hypercholesterolemia by decreasing the TC, TGs, and LDL-C while increasing the HDL-C when compared with the controls. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with both types of rhizomes (ginger and turmeric) inhibited arginase activity and prevented hypercholesterolemia in rats that received a high-cholesterol diet. Therefore, these activities of ginger and turmeric represent possible mechanisms underlying its use in herbal medicine to treat several cardiovascular diseases.

"After an excursus on state-of-the-art knowledge for low-level laser therapy (LLLT), Biolite, a patented ultra-low-level laser therapy device used to treat musculoskeletal pain and associated impairments, is presented. The application protocols include short stimulation of sequences of acupuncture points. The observed effects seem, however, to be far from those that might be expected after acupuncture. The primary effect seems more likely to be an extracellular soft-tissue matrix reaction. The development of the technique, the studies performed, and the evidence collected over > 10 years suggest that specifically modulated laser light can interact with human tissues at light fluences well under those previously considered as being capable of having any effect. Musculoskeletal pain very often becomes an autonomous dysfunction that is independent of the original injury and that can be effectively treated using specific peripheral acupuncture-like stimulation. Because such acupuncture is capable of reducing motor control “interferences” from noxious stimuli, it can improve motor control performance, thereby reducing the risk of falls in the elderly individuals. The proposal of acupuncture-derived protocols to be applied by Western physiotherapists using an ultra-low-level laser therapy device is a further “bridge” between two different, and sometimes very different, clinical worlds to better serve our patients.

"Acupuncture is one of the oldest forms of the natural healing arts. The exact mechanisms of action are unknown at this time; however, current theories to explain the benefits experienced after acupuncture include Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine concepts. Acupuncture may improve the quality of perioperative care and reduce associated complications. Perioperative acupuncture is apparently effective in reducing preoperative anxiety, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain. The Pericardium-6 (P-6; Nei Guan), Yintang (Extra 1), and Shenmen acupuncture points are the most studied and effective acupuncture points in reducing preoperative anxiety, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain experiences. Intraoperatively administered acupuncture may reduce immunosuppression in patients and lessen intraoperative anesthetic requirements, although the clinical usefulness of acupuncture in the intraoperative period remains inconclusive. Perioperative acupuncture is a promising intervention, but additional studies are needed to further understand and define acupuncture's role throughout the perioperative period and determine its clinical usefulness. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief clinical review concerning acupuncture and its application for common issues that occur in the perioperative period.

"Scolopendra extracts were used for pharmacopuncture at the Kidney 1 acupoint to investigate the role of Scolopendra pharmacopuncture (SPP) in both the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation in rats and the contribution of spinal glial cells. A single treatment and five once-daily treatments with SPP were given to evaluate its effects on the development and maintenance stages of neuropathic pain, respectively, which was followed by behavioral tests. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting tests were also carried out. A single treatment of SPP delayed spinal nerve ligation-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and induced a profound decrease in the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor protein in the lumbar spinal cord. Repeated SPP treatments reliably suppressed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at later time points, and these results correlated mainly with decreases in glial fibrillary acidic protein. Intriguingly, ionized calcium binding adaptor protein expression was also reduced after repeated SPP. These results illustrate that neuropathic pain in the development and maintenance stages is alleviated by SPP treatment, which may be ascribed principally to deactivations of microglia and astroglia, respectively. Additionally, microglial inactivation seems to be partially involved in preventing neuropathic pain in the maintenance stage. Scolopendra Scolopendra Scolopendra Scolopendra "
"The effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in lowering blood glucose (BG) in eight fasted male obese Zucker diabetic rats aged 21–24 weeks was investigated. Group 1 (n = 4) received no EA and Group 2 (n = 4) received EA at the Zhongwan and Guanyuan acupoints on Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 8, and Day 10. The BG level of the rats was measured at 10 minutes and 20 minutes after their nose had been inserted into the nose cone of an anesthetic apparatus; then, EA was applied for 30 minutes, and BG was measured again. At the end of the study, the animals were injected with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/mL, intraperitoneally), and blood and white adipose tissue were collected. On statistical analysis, Group 2 showed a significant decrease in mean BG at 20 minutes (baseline) and 50 minutes on Day 8 and Day 10 compared with Day 1 and Day 3, but such a decrease was not observed in Group 1. For Group 2, the baseline BG and the change in BG over 30 minutes were significantly lower on Day 8 and Day 10 compared with Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6, but not for Group 1. No significant differences were noted between the groups in serum insulin, glucose, insulin-to-glucose ratio, adiponectin, leptin, adiponectin-to-leptin ratio, and white adipose tissue. n n n n "
"So far, most research attempts to explain the mechanism of the action of acupuncture have focused mostly on mechanically-triggered active factors and have produced inconclusive findings. In this study, we investigate whether acupuncture might also involve nonmechanical, nonpsychological active factors originating in the therapist. In 30 individuals, an acupuncture needle was inserted in the acupoint PC6 using a special device without touching the needle. A second device was used to fix the needle rigidly in place, excluding any mechanical transmission of movement from the handle to the needle's tip. Each participant was exposed in random order to a control and a stimulation phase. During the stimulation phase, the free needle's end was held by the therapist to allow the transmission of Qi; during the control phase, it was left untouched. Participants' subjective sensations during the stimulation phase and the control phase were recorded using a questionnaire. Twenty-two of 28 (79%; p = 0.003) test participants believed that they had received stimulation when it had actually been performed, and 26 (93%; p < 0.001) sensed differences between the two experimental phases. Thus, participants were able to sense the transmission of therapeutic Qi in the absence of mechanical or psychological factors. p p therapeutic Qi p p therapeutic Qi "
"In this study, the effects of acupuncture in comparison with flat occlusal plane appliance were evaluated in patient with myogenic temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD). The sample consisted of 40 women with TMD and unbalanced energy predominance of Yang Liver Ascension, selected using the Renying and Cunkou pulses, randomly divided into two groups: acupuncture and splint. The effect of treatments on the masseter and anterior temporal muscles was evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment, by means of electromyographic activity (root mean square) and pain pressure threshold. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale, and range of mouth opening was evaluated using a millimeter ruler. All evaluations were performed at the beginning and end of the treatment. Visual analog scale score was reduced equally in the two groups (p < 0001), and the increase in range of mouth opening was significant in both groups. A significant difference was detected only in pain pressure threshold of the left masseter in the acupuncture group (p < 0.05). Only root mean square in the at rest position of the right temporal muscle diminished in the final stage of the splint group (p < 0.05). Both treatments reduced the pain intensity of myogenic TMD in the short term and may be considered strategies for control of chronic pain related to TMD. p p p p p p "
"Currently, the therapeutic strategy against memory deficit induced by alcoholism is not satisfactory and is expensive. Therefore, an effective, low-cost strategy is required. On the basis of the memory-enhancing effect of stimulation of the HT7 acupoint, we aimed to determine whether acupuncture at the HT7 acupoint can reduce alcoholism-induced memory impairment. The possible underlying mechanism was also explored. Alcoholism was induced in male Wistar rats weighing 180–220 g. The alcoholic rats received either acupuncture at HT7 or sham acupuncture for 1 minute bilaterally once daily for 14 days. Their spatial memory was assessed after 1 day, 7 days, and 14 days of treatment. At the end of the study, the malondialdehyde level and the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and acetylcholinesterase enzymes in the hippocampus were determined using colorimetric assays. The results showed that acupuncture at HT7 significantly decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity and the malondialdehyde level, but increased the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the hippocampus. These results suggest that acupuncture at HT7 can effectively reduce the alcoholism-induced memory deficit. However, further studies concerning the detailed relationships between the location of the HT7 acupoint and the changes in the observed parameters are required. "
"A logistic regression equation for the vacuous pulse and the replete pulse was determined based on data obtained using a clip-type pulsimeter equipped with a Hall device that sensed the change in the magnetic field due to the minute movement of a radial artery. To evaluate the efficacy of the two different pulses from the deficiency and the excess syndrome groups, we performed a clinical trial, and we used a statistical regression analysis to process the clinical data from the 180 participants who were enrolled in this study. The ratio of the systolic peak's amplitude to its time in the pulse's waveform was found to be a major efficacy parameter for differentiating between the vacuous pulse and the replete pulse using an empirical equation that was deduced from the data using a statistical logistic regression method. This logistic regression equation can be applied to develop a novel algorithm for pulse measurements based on Oriental medical diagnoses. "
"This study compared the efficacies of acupuncture and anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Fifty patients with mild to moderate CTS were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups received night wrist splints as the standard conservative treatment for 1 month. The acupuncture group also received eight sessions of acupuncture therapy (twice a week for 4 weeks). The control group received 400 mg of ibuprofen three times a day for 10 days. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, the score on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire for Functional Status and Symptom Severity (BCTQ FUNCT and SYMPT), and the electrodiagnostic findings were evaluated at baseline and 1 month after treatment. At the final follow up, significant improvements were found in both groups (p < 0.05). Statistically significant improvements were observed in the VAS score, the score on the global BCTQ FUNCT and SYMPT, and the electrodiagnostic findings, but not in the distal motor latency (DML), in the acupuncture group (p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that acupuncture affected the score on the global BCTQ FUNCT and SYMPT, the VAS score, and the electrodiagnostic findings, except the DML, more than ibuprofen did and that acupuncture might be an effective treatment for CTS. p p p p "
"Although Oriental medicine, by nature, may be considered an etiology-based approach to healing, its role in modern research is primarily empirical. The absolute dependence on symptomatic presentation to establish acupuncture point selection goes against the grain of traditional Oriental methods, which emphasize pulse, tongue, and other diagnostic tools to determine the overall biological and psychological conditions of the patient. Recently introduced diagnostic methods in Oriental medical research indicate a potential shift from empirically to etiologically centered designs. This article reviews current mainstream approaches to efficacy trial designs and proceeds with the analysis of newer research models, such as a constitutional approach spearheaded in Korea by the field of four-constitutional medicine.

"The primo vascular system (PVS) has been observed in various animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, swine, and cow, but not in humans. In this work, we report on the observation of a human PVS on both the epithelial fascia and inside the blood vessels of the umbilical cord (UC). The main morphological characteristics of the primo vessels (PVs) and primo nodes (PNs) from the human UC were in agreement with those of the PVS in various animal organs, including the thicknesses and the transparency of the PVs, the sizes of the PNs, the broken-line arrangement of the rod-shaped nuclei, the sparse distribution of nuclei, and the presence of hollow lumens in the central inner parts of the PNs. It was rather surprising that the human PV was not thicker than the PVs from small animals. The difference between the PVS and blood/lymph vessels was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining of von Willebrand factor, CD31, LYVE-1, and D2-40. The positive expression of the PVS to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a cell-proliferation marker, was consistent with the recent finding of very small embryonic-like stem cells in the PVS of mice.

"Acupuncture is widely used in clinical practice. According to traditional acupuncture theory, the Neiguan acupoint (PC6) is one of the most commonly used acupoints and is indicated for treating cardiovascular-related disorders. We present the case of a 27-year-old female who had been diagnosed with ventricular septal defect and had undergone surgery to repair the defect at the age of 11 years. The patient had no obvious symptoms, such as palpitations and difficulty breathing. However, while performing electrocardiography (ECG), we found that she suffered from arrhythmia, and therefore, we treated her by acupuncture at the left PC6. An ECG monitor was used to record data during the entire acupuncture procedure, which was divided into the following three segments: prior to, during, and after acupuncture. Various indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were then determined and analyzed. The results indicate that acupuncture can regulate the HRV effectively; however, more studies are needed to confirm this finding. "
"Because of the potential roles of the primo vascular system (PVS) in cancer metastasis, immune function, and regeneration, understanding the molecular biology of the PVS is desirable. The current state of PVS research is comparable to that of lymph research prior to the advent of Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1). There is very little knowledge of the molecular biology of the PVS due to difficulties in identifying and isolating primo endothelial cells. Present investigations rely on the morphology and the use of differential staining procedures to identify the PVS within tissues, making detailed molecular studies all but impossible. To overcome such difficulties, one may emulate the explosive development of lymph molecular biology. For this purpose, there is a need for a reliable method to obtain PVS specimens to initiate the molecular investigation. One of the most reliable methods is to detect the primo vessels and primo nodes afloat in the lymph flow. The protocols for observation of the PVS in the large lymph ducts in the abdominal cavity and the thoracic cavity were reported earlier. These methods require a laparectomy and skillful techniques. In this work, we present a protocol to identify and harvest PVS specimens from the lymph ducts connecting the inguinal and the axillary nodes, which are located entirely in the skin. Thus, the PVS specimen is more easily obtainable. This method is a stepping-stone toward development of a system to monitor migration of cancer cells in metastasis from a breast tumor to the axillary nodes, where cancer cells use the PVS as a survival rope in hostile lymph flow.

"The aim of this study is to review current studies on the effect of acupuncture therapy on bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy. The authors of the present paper have searched related literature over the past 10 years at home and abroad, analyzing the features and the effects of acupuncture therapy (including acupuncture, moxibustion, point injection, point application, etc.) for treating myelosuppression after tumor chemotherapy. We also discuss the year of publication, document type, acupuncture therapy, acupoint selection, and adverse effects with figures. We analyzed 159 articles related to acupuncture therapy from 2004 to 2013, and the analysis revealed that point injection was the most frequently used therapy for clinical applications, and that Zusanli (ST36) was the most frequently used acupoint. The results showed that some problems regarding the design method, acupoint selection, and acupuncture intervention measure existed in those research studies. We hope to provide readers with an overall and objective understanding of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy for treating myelosuppression after tumor chemotherapy. "
"Obesity is one of the leading health risk factors worldwide and is associated with several other risk factors and health problems. Acupuncture is utilized to treat a variety of health problems, one of which is obesity. Fifty-six obese women with body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 were recruited for this trial and were randomly divided into two groups, one with combined manual acupuncture and massage therapy (MAMT), and the other with only manual acupuncture therapy (MAT). In addition, 40 overweight women with BMI 23–25 kg/m2 were randomly divided into two groups, one with MAMT and the other with MAT. Therapy was carried out once per day for 21 days, and the body weights and the BMIs were recorded every day. The results showed that both MAMT and MAT could reduce body weight and BMI significantly, compared with the pretreatment values, for all the participants (p < 0.001); however, the differences in body weight and BMI reductions between pre- and posttreatment for the MAMT and the MAT groups were not statistically significant. The optimal periods for reductions in both body weight and in BMI were the first 4 days. Accounting for the economic strategy (time and money) in alternative therapy, MAT alone may present a reasonable option in the treatment of overweight and obesity in adults."
"The aim of this study was to investigate a new method of manual acupuncture that used a magnetic field to stimulate only one acupoint vertically. We developed an eight-channel electromagnetic acupuncture (EMA) system that uses a solenoid-type electrode to insert the manual acupuncture needle into a hole in an electrode. We used a manual acupuncture needle for magnetic induction in order to penetrate vertically and deeply into tissues. In order to confirm the usefulness of EMA, we investigated the effects of treatment on muscle fatigue after strenuous knee extension/flexion exercises that had been performed by three groups: the nonstimulation, the manual acupuncture, and the EMA groups. Electromyograms showed that the median frequency (MF) in the EMA group had rapidly recovered after 4 minutes (p = 0.608), but that the peak torque had not recovered to the normal state (p < 0.05). Thus, we confirmed that compared with manual acupuncture, EMA resulted in better recovery from muscle fatigue."
"Cupping is one of the various treatment methods used in traditional oriental medicine. Cupping is also used as a diagnostic method and it may cause skin hyperpigmentation. Quantitative measurements and analysis of changes in skin color due to cupping are critical. The purpose of this study is to suggest an optical technique to visualize and identify changes in skin color due to cupping. We suggest the following analysis methods: digital color spaces [red, green, and blue (RGB) and L∗a∗b], the Erythema Index (E.I.), and the Melanin Index (M.I.). For experiments, we selected and stimulated 10 acupoints at 80 kilopascals (kPa) per minute. The RGB and L∗a∗b color spaces were observed to be decreased (p < 0.05) after cupping. The E.I. and M.I. were observed to be increased significantly (p < 0.05) after cupping. To assess various changes in skin color, we observed the changes for 72 hours. We also obtained the color changes by using the recovery pattern during the recovery period (p < 0.01). We propose that this method can be useful for visual identification and as a way to improve the identification of skin color changes."
"The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of acupuncture, core-stability exercises, and treadmill 12-minute walking exercises in treating patients with postsurgical lumbar disc herniation. A 34-year-old woman with a history lumbar disc prolapse who had undergone lumbar disc surgery on two different occasions was treated using acupuncture, core-stability exercises, and treadmill walking exercises three times per week for 12 weeks. The outcome measures used in this study were pain intensity, spinal range of movement, and general health. After 12 weeks of treatment, the patient had made improvement in terms of pain, which was reduced from 9/10 to 1/10. In a similar vein, the patient's general health showed improvement of >100% after 12 weeks of treatment. Pre-treatment scores of spinal flexion and left-side flexion, which measured 20 cm and 12 cm, respectively, increased to 25 cm and 16 cm after 12 weeks of treatment. This study showed that acupuncture, core-stability exercises, and treadmill walking exercises were useful in relieving pain, increasing spinal range of movement, and improving the health of a patient with postsurgical lumbar disc herniation.

A search of the Chinese medicine literature reveals several conflicting explanations of the division of the body into yin and yang surfaces. This paper attempts to clarify this basic concept and reconcile the differing descriptions of it through an exploration of material from other disciplines. A remarkable similarity exists between the surfaces on the human body that are defined by the pathways of the yin and yang meridians and those that have evolved from the ventral and the dorsal aspects of early vertebrate structure. Many of the evolutionary changes described have parallels in our embryological development and are evident in the underlying anatomy of our limbs. The degree of convergence between the two descriptions strongly supports the definition of the yin and yang surfaces as those traversed by the yin and yang meridians. It also goes a long way towards reconciling the conflicting definitions found in the literature. Finding a solution to this question of yin and yang surfaces that is based on anatomy and evolutionary theories has several advantages. It can throw light on differences in the clinical effects of points on the yin and yang meridians and enable the identification of anomalies in the pathways of the main meridian network. 
"Electroacupuncture analgesia was used for surgery in horses and donkeys. A KWD-808 electrical stimulator was used to incrementally induce a dense, dispersed wave output at frequencies from 20 to 55 Hz, which was maintained at a frequency of 55 Hz, and to change the amplitude of the wave to the best grading number for the suggested operation in each animal. Induction of analgesia lasted for 20–30 minutes, and the effect of analgesia was maintained for 20–45 minutes depending on the type of surgery performed. The exhibited clinical signs, physical examination data, and the responses of all animals were used for evaluating the periods of analgesia. Although the majority of the cases (95%) had no response to strong surgical pain, they experienced significant increases in heart rates and respiratory rates during induction. The lack of pain, relaxed surgical procedures, reduced intraoperative bleeding, and improved healing without complications were all definite benefits of using electroacupuncture analgesia in surgery. Thus, this study has provided surgical evidence supporting the effectiveness of electroacupuncture analgesia, as well as confirming its reliability, in the field of equine anesthesia and surgery. "
"Originating in ancient China, acupuncture using needles has been developed for thousands of years and has received attention for its reported medical remedies, such as pain relief and chronic disease treatment. Heat transfer through the needles, which might have effects on the biomechanism of acupuncture, providing a stimulus and regulating homeostasis, has never been studied. This article analyzes the significance of heat transfer through needles via convection and conduction, approached by means of computational analysis. The needle is a cylindrical body, and an axis symmetrical steady-state heat-transfer model that viscosity and static pressure was not applied. This article evaluates heat transfer via acupuncture needles by using five metal materials: silver, copper, brass, iron, and stainless steel. A silver needle of the type extensively applied in acupuncture can dissipate more than seven times as much heat as a stainless steel needle of the same type. Heat transfer through such a needle is significant, compared to natural body-energy consumption over a range of ambient temperatures. The mechanism by which heat flows in or out of the body through the needles may be crucial in the remedial efficacy of acupuncture. "
"In this research, radial pulse differences according to gender and measuring positions in healthy individuals were investigated in an objective manner. A total of 372 healthy volunteers (189 males and 183 females) participated in this study. The radial pulse was measured at six different measuring positions using a multistep tonometry system. The pulse data were compared between males and females and between different measuring positions. Compared to the pulses in females, those in males were deeper and slower, with a longer diastolic proportion and a shorter systolic proportion. Amplitude of the radial pulse increased as it went distal. The pulse was deepest at the Cheock position and shallowest at the Gwan position. Compared to the right pulse, the radial augmentation index was higher and the main peak angle was larger in case of the left pulse. The results of this research show that the radial pulses in healthy individuals differ significantly according to gender and measuring positions. Cheock Gwan Cheock Gwan "
"Laser acupuncture has been studied extensively over several decades to establish evidence-based clinical practice. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of laser acupuncture on pain and functional outcomes when it is used to treat musculoskeletal disorders and to update existing evidence with data from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A computer-based literature search of the databases MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTSDiscus, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Web of Science, and SCOPUS was used to identify RCTs comparing between laser acupuncture and control interventions. A meta-analysis was performed by calculating the standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals, to evaluate the effect of laser acupuncture on pain and functional outcomes. Included studies were assessed in terms of their methodological quality and appropriateness of laser parameters. Forty-nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Two-thirds (31/49) of these studies reported positive effects, were of high methodological quality, and reported the dosage adequately. Negative or inconclusive studies commonly failed to demonstrate these features. For all diagnostic subgroups, positive effects for both pain and functional outcomes were more consistently seen at long-term follow-up rather than immediately after treatment. Moderate-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of laser acupuncture in managing musculoskeletal pain when applied in an appropriate treatment dosage; however, the positive effects are seen only at long-term follow-up and not immediately after the cessation of treatment.

"Fasted, male, obese, Zucker, diabetic fatty rats aged 10–16 weeks were anesthetized with 1% halothane in nitrous oxide–oxygen (3:1) on alternate weekdays over 2 weeks. Group 1 (n = 4) did not receive electroacupuncture (controls); Group 2 (n = 4) received electroacupuncture using the Zhongwan and the Guanyuan acupoints; Group 3 (n = 4) received electroacupuncture using the bilateral Zusanli acupoints; Group 4 (n = 6) received neither halothane in nitrous oxide:oxygen nor electroacupuncture. At the end of study, animals were injected with sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/mL, i.p.), and blood and white adipose tissue were collected. Analysis of variance and Duncan's tests showed that the mean leptin in serum was significantly lower and the adiponectin:leptin ratio was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p < 0.05); for Group 4, the serum leptin was significantly higher than it was for Groups 1–3 (p < 0.05), and the adiponectin:leptin ratio was significantly lower than it was for Group 2 (p < 0.05). Similar changes occurred for the leptin levels in the pelvic adipose tissue. In addition, for Group 2, the mean serum insulin: glucose ratio was significantly higher than it was for Group 1 (p < 0.05); for Group 4 the mean serum insulin and insulin: glucose ratio were significantly higher than they were for Groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but not Group 2 (p > 0.05). No significant differences in the serum or the adipose-tissue measurements between Groups 1 and 3 were observed (p > 0.05). n n n n p p p p p p p n n n n p p p p p p p "
"In order to study Sa-Ahm's underlying thoughts on the basis of Yin-Yang and the five-element theory, the 12 acupuncture meridian systems and eight extra meridian systems were investigated in detail. The clinical acupuncture points for Sa-Ahm's four-needle acupuncture technique were also reviewed. The forms of the combinations using the five Shu acupuncture points, which are based on the promotion and control cycles with tonification and sedation, were shown to connect to the acupuncture points, which represent the meridian system itself. However, not all of Sa-Ahm's clinical cases were fully explained by this doctrine, so the five correlations among the meridian systems and the acupuncture points that affect the clinical treatment and the occurrence of disease were determined. The mutual efficacies for Sa-Ahm's clinical cases can be analyzed and explained with correlativity diagrams that include five interrelations. "
"Abdominal pain in elderly patients leads to challenge due to diagnostic difficulty and high incidence of complications. This case report presents an elderly patient with acute and severe abdominal pain, who did not respond to Western treatments. The patient was diagnosed to have abdominal pain by Yang deficiency of spleen (脾陽虛). Acupuncture (mainly at LI4 and LR3), indirect moxibustion (CV4 and CV8), and a herbal drug [DaehwangBuja-Tang (大黃附子湯)] were given to the patient; the abdominal pain and related symptoms disappeared completely within 3 days. This study proved the potential use of traditional Korean medicine for treating abdominal pain in elderly patients.

"Psychiatric disorders can be described and treated from both a Western (allopathic) and an Eastern perspective, which should be taken into account when conducting research. Patients with schizophrenia or depression are likely to be undergoing Western treatment when they are referred to an acupuncturist for (add-on) treatment, and knowledge of both types of treatments is necessary to integrate them successfully. In this study, the different Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM) diagnostic patterns in patients with a Western diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, or sleep disorders are described from a literature and a clinical perspective. The data on 30 depression and 30 schizophrenia patients from a German study are presented. Our results show that if a psychiatric group, sorted in accordance to Western diagnostic principles, is diagnosed on the basis of TOM diagnostic patterns, it can be categorized into different groups of patients with psychiatric disorders; this finding has far-reaching consequences in scientific research on acupuncture. Moreover, we found a high prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with both schizophrenia and depression, which could be explained from the perspective of a TOM diagnostic pattern. Finally, we discuss sleep quality as a treatment objective that may play a crucial role in mediating acupuncture-induced treatment effects in patients with schizophrenia and depression. "
"Acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2000 years to treat a variety of diseases based on the “meridian theory,” as described in the “Yellow Emperor's Classics of Internal Medicine.” Deqi refers to the excitation of qi or vital energy inside meridians by acupuncture needle stimulation. Patients often experience multidimensional and intense needling sensations such as numbness, soreness, distention, heaviness, dull pain, and sharp pain during acupuncture stimulation. Deqi is considered as an important parameter in the process of achieving therapeutic effectiveness in acupuncture treatment. Understanding this phenomenon from neurophysiological aspects is important for clinical practice and enables practitioners to perform quantitative acupuncture evaluation to obtain a reliable prognosis of acupuncture treatment. This review paper describes our current knowledge and understanding of Deqi from a physiological aspect. Deqi Deqi Deqi Deqi Deqi Deqi "
"The aim of this study is to investigate paraclinical changes in glycemia, serum cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) due to electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA) in a rabbit undergoing an ovariohysterectomy. Seven clinically healthy New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. Local and systemic analgesia was represented by EAA. Blood samples were collected at preoperative, operative, and postoperative times. At the operative time, increased cortisolemia does not promote a proportional increase in glycemia even though it is correlated with an increased level of ACTH. EAA follows the stress mechanism, which is coordinated by neuroendocrine activity. EAA in a rabbit ovariohysterectomy underscores the crucial involvement of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis with a direct influence on paraclinical changes, including changes in glycemia, cortisol, and ACTH, which are specific for stress changes.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture point PC6 (Neiguan) in controlling nausea during intraoral impression taking. This study was conducted in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. The sample consisted of 33 adult volunteers with nausea, who were randomly divided into control and study groups, and treated with nonpenetrating sham acupuncture and real acupuncture, respectively, at acupoint PC6. The two groups had two maxillary impressions taken, one prior to acupuncture and the other after acupuncture. The nausea assessment was made using the visual analog scale, Gagging Severity Index (GSI), and Gagging Prevention Index. Volunteers' expectation that nausea would be reduced through acupuncture was also assessed. For statistical analysis, we used the t test and the Spearman correlation (p < 0.05). When assessed by Gagging Severity Index/Gagging Prevention Index, nausea was reduced in the real acupuncture group (p < 0.01). In the visual analog scale assessment, similar reductions of nausea were noted in both groups (p > 0.05). No correlation existed between the expected and the actual reductions in nausea. Our results indicate that acupoint PC6 was effective for controlling nausea during the maxillary impression-taking procedure. Patients' expectation did not influence the results. t p p p t p p p "
"In Oriental medicine, the state of blood stagnation is called “Oketsu,” meaning preceding state or symptomatic of sickness. Acupuncture stimulation is often used clinically for the treatment of “Oketsu.” The degree of “Oketsu” is indicated by tongue color and form, swelling, paroxysmal blushing, and dark circles under the eyes. The blood's fluidity is generally thought to be a blood stagnation factor. “Oketsu” is now considered as physiological blood flow and is studied from the perspective of the blood's fluidity and vascular resistance. In our preliminary research, acupuncture stimuli were very effective in treating conditions associated with a decrease in the fluidity of the blood, such as “Oketsu.” In this review, we discuss recent progress in acupuncture therapy and report mechanisms of its action; we then focus on our original findings on these topics. Furthermore, we propose new factors related to acupuncture stimuli, including the blood's fluidity, and report our investigations, using the restraint stress method, on the mechanisms underlying acupuncture stimuli.

"Acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2000 years to treat a variety of diseases based on the “meridian theory” as described in the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine. To this date, the meridian theory continues to be an important guide for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to diagnose and treat patients. Although the meridians have not been identified reliably as actual anatomical structures, they appear to serve as a road map to identify the location of various acupoints. Research has shown that acupoints overlie major neuronal bundles. The meridians extensively studied in the cardiovascular realm are the pericardial meridians (P) 5, 6, which overlie the deep median nerve. Meridians involved with gastrointestinal processes are (St) 36, 37, which overlie the deep peroneal nerve. Acupuncture needles, either manipulated manually or stimulated using a low current and frequency, have been documented to be a neurophysiological basis for modulating the activity of peripheral and central neural pathways. This review describes our current understanding of acupoints and meridians from a physiological aspect. Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine. Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine. "
"The effects of stimulation with sound and ultrasonic waves of a specific bandwidth on the microdissection of primo vessels in lymphatic vessels of rabbit were investigated. The primo vessels stained with alcian-blue dye injected in the lymph nodes were definitely visualized and more easily isolated by sound-wave vibration and ultrasonic stimulation applied to rabbits at various frequencies and intensities. With sound wave at 7 Hz and ultrasonic waves at 2 MHz, the probability of detecting the primo vessels was improved to 90%; however, without wave stimulation the probability of discovering primo vessels was about 50% only. Sound and ultrasonic waves at specific frequency bands should be effective for microdissection of the primo vessels in the abdominal lymph of rabbit. We suggest that oscillation of the primo vessels by sound and ultrasonic waves may be useful to visualize specific primo structure, and wave vibration can be a very supportive process for observation and isolation of the primo vessels of rabbits.

"This article presents a review of our studies on the cholinergic vasodilative system in the cerebral cortex in relation to the effects of acupuncture and aging. In anesthetized rats, manual acupuncture-like stimulation of the cheek, forepaw, upper arm, and hindpaw increases the cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF). The mechanism for the increased response of CBF due to forepaw stimulation has been found to be a reflex response whose afferents are Groups III and IV somatic afferent fibers and whose efferents are cholinergic fibers that originate in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Although the cholinergic cortical vasodilation to nucleus basalis of Meynert stimulation at high intensities declines with age, the increased response of CBF induced by natural somatic afferent stimulation, such as an acupuncture-like stimulation of a forepaw, is well maintained even in very old rats (approximately 3 years of age). These findings in anesthetized rats may support the application of acupuncture to elderly people and patients with disturbances in the CBF by activating the intracranial cholinergic vasodilative system.

"Magnetic fields are widely considered as a method of treatment to increase the therapeutic effect when applied to acupoints. Hence, this study proposes a new method which creates significant stimulation of acupoints by using weak magnetic fields. We conducted this experiment in order to confirm the effect on the activation level of the autonomic nervous system by measuring pupil sizes in cases of stimulation by using manual acupuncture and electromagnetic acupuncture (EMA) at BL15. We selected 30 Hz of biphasic wave form with 570.1 Gauss. To confirm the biopotential by the magnetic flux density occurring in EMA that affected the activation of the autonomic nervous system, we observed the biopotential induced at the upper and the mid left and right trapezius. We observed a significant decrease in pupil size only in the EMA group (p < 0.05), thus confirming that EMA decreased the pupil size through activation of the parasympathetic nerve in the autonomic nervous system. Moreover, we confirmed that the amplitude of the biopotential which was caused by 570.1 Gauss was higher than ±20 μA. Thus, we can conclude that EMA treatment successfully activates the parasympathetic nerve in the autonomic nervous system by inducing a biotransformation by the induced biopotential. p p "
"This is a case report of a female patient who developed complex regional pain syndrome in the left upper limb after a traumatic injury to the distal part of the left forearm. The pain was immediate and resistant to oral analgesics and continued transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Five months after the injury, the patient presented to our clinic with severe pain, swelling, redness, cold sensation of the left hand, and loss of function from the left hand up to the left shoulder. Acupuncture points LI5, LU2, SI10, HT1, GB21, and SI11 (which are localized in the joints or in the muscles responsible for the movement of the left upper limb) were selected for the application of the placental extract. Injection of placental extract into the acupuncture points resulted in dramatic pain relief, swelling remission, motor recovery, temperature normalization, and disappearance of redness in this patient with complex regional pain syndrome type 1.

"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bipolar electroacupuncture (EA) on a soft tissue defect in rabbits. Ten clinically healthy New Zealand white rabbits were divided into two groups: the control group (Group C, n = 5) and the experimental (EA) group (Group T, n = 5). During neuroleptanalgesia, defects of soft tissue (skin and muscle) were made at the dorsum site on the rabbits in both groups, and those defects were stimulated using EA. The biopsy samples were collected on Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6, prepared for histology, and examined microscopically. On the 2nd day, in Group C, the inflammatory degree was higher than it was in Group T; on subsequent days, low or identical degrees of inflammation were observed in both groups. Proliferative fibrous activity was increased on Day 4 for Group T and identical for both groups on Day 6. The dynamics of the epidermal thickness were characterized by a high rate on Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6 for Group T. EA facilitates a low tissue mechanical stress and has a positive effect on the healing of muscular defects. EA enhances the healing process, with no side effects. n n nd n n nd "
"The current study investigated the effects of acupuncture at Zu-San-Li (ST36) on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis during ethanol withdrawal in rats. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with 3 g/kg/day of ethanol or saline for 28 days. Following 24 hours of ethanol withdrawal, acupuncture was applied at bilateral ST36 points or non-acupoints (tail) for 1 minute. Plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) protein levels in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus were also examined by RIA 20 minutes after the acupuncture treatment. RIA showed significantly increased plasma levels of CORT and ACTH in the ethanol-withdrawn rats compared with the saline-treated rats, which were inhibited significantly by the acupuncture at the acupoint ST36 but not at the non-acupoint. Additionally, ethanol withdrawal promoted CRF protein expressions in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which were also blocked by the acupuncture at ST36. These findings suggest that acupuncture at the specific acupoint ST36 can inhibit ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperactivation of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and it may be mediated via the modulation of hypothalamic CRF.

"This study analyzed the electromyographic and strength responses of the flexor muscles of the wrist following stimulation of acupuncture points. A total of 52 participants were randomly divided into four groups: local (heart 3, HT3), distant (heart 4, HT4), control (bladder 60, BL60), and naïve control groups. To obtain the root mean square electromyographic activity, we placed surface electrodes over the wrist flexors. To obtain kilogram force (kgf) values, we attached a force transducer to the floor and to the hands of participants. Both values were recorded over three repetitions of maximal isometric wrist flexion contractions. Data were analyzed using one-way analyses of variance, followed by Dunnett's post-hoc tests. We found reductions in electromyographic activity contralateral to the stimulated point in the distant group 10 minutes after removal of the needles (F3,48 = 3.25; p < 0.05). Regarding muscle strength, ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation in the distant group produced kgf levels prior to and 10 minute and 20 minutes after withdrawal of the acupuncture needle that were lower than that obtained prior to insertion of the needle (F3,48 = 5.82; p < 0.05). Thus, stimulation of the acupuncture points distant from the wrist flexors reduced ipsilateral and contralateral muscle strength and decreased the root mean square values contralateral to the site of stimulation.

"This article introduces the Layer Analysis Method of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic text to revive its use in modern acupuncture and medicine. This is a crucial concept, especially for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases by acupuncture. First, the rise and decline of this method is explored. Second, the differentiation of this method is described by symptoms, the affected organs, and the stage of the disease. Third, the treatment method is summarized into four categories: (1) equipment, (2) technique, (3) acupoint, and (4) pathology. The resemblance of the Layer Analysis Method to modern clinical applications is worth examining. The sinew layer is especially fascinating with its similarity to the Anatomy Trains' track. The skin, vessel, muscle, and bone layers have their respective resemblances to their counterparts in modern medicine. The holism concept of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is demonstrated throughout the Layer Analysis Method theory. In addition, the Layer Analysis Method of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic should be reconsidered and complemented by channel-collateral pattern differentiation for acupuncturists to achieve better clinical results. Future research on acupuncture should consider this theory with the channel-collateral pattern differentiation theory. "
"Stress is a major problem in today’s fast-paced society and can lead to serious psychosomatic complications. The ancient Chinese mind–body exercise of Tai Chi may provide an alternative and self-sustaining option to pharmaceutical medication for stressed individuals to improve their coping mechanisms. The protocol of this study is designed to evaluate whether Tai Chi practice is equivalent to standard exercise and whether the Tai Chi group is superior to a wait-list control group in improving stress coping levels. This study is a 6-week, three-arm, parallel, randomized, clinical trial designed to evaluate Tai Chi practice against standard exercise and a Tai Chi group against a nonactive control group over a period of 6 weeks with a 6-week follow-up. A total of 72 healthy adult participants (aged 18–60 years) who are either Tai Chi naïve or have not practiced Tai Chi in the past 12 months will be randomized into a Tai Chi group (n = 24), an exercise group (n = 24) or a wait-list group (n = 24).

"Background The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of leech therapy (LT), in comparison with topical phenytoin (PHT), on incisional skin-wound healing in animal models. Methods This experimental study included 15 male rats (5 animals in 3 groups) with approximately equal body weights (350 ± 10 g). Skin wounds with lengths of 20 mm and depths of 0.5 mm were made on the dorsolateral region of rats 4 cm from the spine. The first group (PHT group) was treated daily with topical PHT (1%) while the second group (LT group) received LT at the beginning of the experiment. The control group received neither the drug nor the therapy. Wound healing was evaluated every day, and the study was continued until the wound had completely healed. Changes in the areas and the appearances of the skin wounds and histological differences (at the end of the experiment) were used to investigate the differences in wound healing among the groups. Results The process of wound healing was significantly faster in the group treated with LT (p < 0.05) than in the group treated with the PHT. p p Conclusion The study results showed that LT improved incisional skin-wound healing in rats.

"This study investigated thermal changes in the skin at locations where soft tissue defects existed and acupuncture needles stimulated by using bipolar electroacupuncture (EA) had been inserted. Under general anesthesia (GA), experimental defects were made at the dorsum site of five New Zealand rabbits. Bipolar EA was used for 20 minutes to stimulate the experimental defects, and the skin temperature was monitored at the sites where the acupuncture needles had been inserted and the soft tissue defects existed. The initial thermography of those defects had the same trend as that of the negative pole of EA stimulation at the first acupoint. Skin thermography during the first 3 minutes of bipolar EA indicated a centrifugal vasoconstriction and a vasodilatation at the negative and positive poles, respectively. After that, the thermal change in soft tissue undergoing EA stimulation was not modified by a different EA polarity. The local temperature at the defect and its surroundings under both positive and negative electric loads was increased by 0.2–0.3 °C for vasodilatation. This study indicates that EA influences sympathetic modulation of soft tissue defects and that selective sympathetic modulation caused by bipolar EA is responsible for the clinical perception. "
"The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of short-term bed rest on the radial pulse in healthy subjects. Twenty-one healthy volunteers participated in this study. Their radial pulse was measured at different measuring positions using a multi-step tonometry system. The participants took 30 minutes of bed rest and their radial pulse was measured before and after the bed rest. The effects of bed rest on the radial pulse were analyzed. The pulse area, the amplitudes of h4 and h5, the pulse period, and the diastolic pulse proportion increased with short-term bed rest, whereas the proportions of systolic and hightension pulse and the fundamental frequency of the pulse wave decreased with short-term bed rest. All the changes were in the same direction in both male and female participants at all measuring positions; however, some parameters changed more in women than in men, and some changed more at the distal position than at the proximal position. In shortly, Short-term bed rest induces significant changes in the radial pulse of healthy subjects. The results of this study could be used as a control reference for clinical acupuncture studies with participants lying on a bed for acupuncture treatment. "
"Pimpinella anisum L. (P. anisum) is used as a galactagogue in traditional medicine; hence, the effect of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of P. anisum seeds on milk production in rats was evaluated. The milk production was assessed by measuring the pups' weights during the suckling period. The intraperitoneal LD50 values of P. anisum aqueous and ethanolic extracts were 4.93 and 3.77 g/kg, respectively. The aqueous (1 g/kg) and ethanolic extracts (1 g/kg) increased the milk production significantly (p < 0.001), with about 68.1% and 81% more milk being produced, respectively, than in the control group. The pups gained weight during the study period with the aqueous (0.5 and 1 g/kg, p < 0.05) and ethanolic (0.5 and 1 g/kg, p < 0.01) extracts. Thus, P. anisum aqueous and ethanolic extracts can increase milk production in rats.

"The present investigation has been undertaken to study the antioxidant, antitumor, and wound healing properties of Rubus ellipticus. The R. ellipticus leaves were extracted using organic solvents in Soxhlet and were subjected to in vitro antioxidant assays. R. ellipticus leaf methanol (RELM) extract, which showed higher in vitro antioxidant activity, was taken for the evaluation of in vivo antioxidant, antitumor, and wound healing properties. Acute oral and dermal toxicity studies showed the safety of RELM up to a dose of 2 g/kg. A significant wound healing property was observed in incision, excision, and Staphylococcus aureus-induced infected wound models in the treatment groups compared to the control group. A complete epithelialization period was noticed during the 13th day and the 19th day. A 250-mg/kg treatment was found to prolong the life span of mice with Ehrlich ascite carcinoma (EAC; 46.76%) and to reduce the volume of Dalton's lymphoma ascite (DLA) solid tumors (2.56 cm3). The present study suggests that R. ellipticus is a valuable natural antioxidant and that it is immensely effective for treating skin diseases, wounds, and tumors.

"There is no consensus on the management of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, but local corticosteroid injection is considered the mainstay of treatment. However, some patients are reluctant to take steroid injections. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of acupuncture versus corticosteroid injection for the treatment of this disease. Thirty patients were consequently treated in two groups. The acupuncture group received five acupuncture sessions of 30 minutes duration on classic points of LI-5, LU-7, and LU-9 and on ahshi points. The injection group received one methylprednisolone acetate injection in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. The degree of disability and pain was evaluated by using the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Q-DASH) scale and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at baseline and at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the start of treatment. The baseline means of the Q-DASH and the VAS scores were 62.8 and 6.9, respectively. At the last follow-up, the mean Q-DASH scores were 9.8 versus 6.2 in the acupuncture and injection groups, respectively, and the mean VAS scores were 2 versus 1.2. We demonstrated short-term improvement of pain and function in both groups. Although the success rate was somewhat higher with corticosteroid injection, acupuncture can be considered as an alternative option for treatment of De Quervain's tenosynovitis. "
"Traditional Eastern medicine has had a successful existence for a long time and has provided functional paths for curing disease. However, some scientists do not accept acupuncture, primarily because the meridian system lacks a physical anatomical basis. To date, scientific theories have not been able to explain the functional paths used by traditional Eastern medicine to cure disease. According to Western medicine, no known anatomical foundation exists for the meridians and unknown nervous, circulatory, endocrine, and immune mechanisms mediate the effects of acupuncture. In the early 1960s, only one hypothesis was proposed to explain the anatomical basis of the meridians. By using different experimental approaches during the past 10 years, the number of scientific papers that report the discovery of different anatomical and physiological evidence confirming the existence of an anatomical basis for the meridian system has increased. Morphological science is greatly challenged to offer a new biomedical theory that explains the possible existence of new bodily systems such as the primo vascular system (PVS). The PVS is a previously unknown system that integrates the features of the cardiovascular, nervous, immune, and hormonal systems. It also provides a physical substrate for the acupuncture points and meridians. Announcements of the morphological architectonics and the function of the PVS fundamentally changed the basic understanding of biology and medicine because the PVS is involved in the development and the functions of living organisms. We propose a new vision of the anatomical basis for the PVS and the vital energy—called “Qi”—as an electromagnetic wave that is involved very closely with the DNA in the PVS. DNA provides genetic information and it functions as a store of information that can be obtained from the electromagnetic fields of the environment. The PVS is the communication system between living organisms and the environment, and it lies at the lowest level of life. The theory of the PVS could be a good basis for forming a new point of view of Darwin's evolutionary theory. Discoveries in morphological theory—such as discoveries with respect to the PVS—have not been made since the 18th century. For that reason, the PVS needs more attention. Qi Qi "
"Background/aim Recently, a novel circulatory system, the primo vascular system (PVS), was found to be a potent metastatic route of cancer cells. The aim of the current work is to demonstrate that cancer cells injected into the testis migrate through the primo vessel (PV). Materials and methods NCI-H460 cells labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles (FNP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene transfection were injected into testicular parenchyma in 24 rats. After 24 hours of injection, the abdominal cavity was investigated via a stereomicroscope, to detect the PVS, and the samples were analyzed histologically with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and hematoxylin and eosin. Results Injected cancer cells were detected inside the PVS distributed on the abdominal organs. Some were detected inside intestinal parenchyma into which the attached primo vessels (PVs) entered. Conclusion The results supported the fact that the PVS may be a novel migration path of cancer cells, in addition to the lymphatic and hematogenous routes. "
"An epoch-making development in the gross anatomy of the lymph system has emerged: the observation of the primo vascular system (PVS), which is a threadlike structure floating in lymph ducts. The PVS, which was proposed as the conduit for the acupuncture Qi, is a complex network distributed throughout an animal's body. The lymph-PVS, which is a subsystem of the PVS, is one of the most convincing visual demonstrations of the PVS. Because its existence is not easily demonstrated, even with a microscope, due to its transparency, in current anatomy its existence is largely unknown despite its potential significance in physiology and medicine. The lymph-PVS has been observed in rabbits, rats, and mice by several independent teams. Because the involved techniques are rather complicated, we provide detailed protocols for surgery, for injection of the staining dye, and for detection, extraction, and identification of the PVS in a rat.

"Aqueous-methanolic extract of Parkia biglobosa bark (PBB) was screened for its polyphenolic constituents, in vitro antioxidant activity, and effect on mitochondria redox status. The in vitro antioxidant activity was assessed by using the scavenging abilities and the reducing powers of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) diammonium salt radical cation against Fe3+. Subsequently, the ability of PBB to inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by FeSO4 (10 μm) and its metal-chelating potential were investigated. The effects of the extract on basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in isolated mitochondria were determined by using 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin (DCFH) oxidation and safranin fluorescence, respectively. PBB mitigated the Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation in rat tissues and showed dose-dependent scavenging of DPPH (IC50: 98.33 ± 10.0 μg/mL) and ABTS. (trolox equivalent antioxidant concentration, TEAC value = 0.05), with considerable ferric-reducing and moderate metal-chelating abilities. PBB caused slight decreases in both the liver and the brain mitochondria potentials and resulted in a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in DCFH oxidation. Screening for polyphenolics using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) revealed the presence of caffeic acid, gallic acid, catechin, epigalocatechin, rutin, and quercetin. These results demonstrate for the first time the considerable in vitro antioxidant activity and favorable effect of PBB on mitochondria redox status and provide justification for the use of the plant in ethnomedicine.

"We isolated a triterpenoid from an ethanolic extract of Phytolacca decandra and nanoencapsulated it with biodegradable nontoxic polymers of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) to examine if the nanoform of this hitherto unexplored betulinic-acid derivative (NdBA) could produce a stronger anticancer effect by rendering better drug bioavailability and targeted delivery than the nonencapsulated betulinic-acid derivative (dBA). The nanoparticles were characterized with the help of physicochemical and morphological studies involving dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. A549 cancer cells were exposed to NdBA and dBA at the IC50 doses of 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis was determined by examining the changes in the intracellular calcium content, the reactive oxygen species accumulation, the cytochrome c release, the upregulation of Bcl-2-associated-X protein (Bax) and caspase 3, the downregulation of B cell lymphoma 2, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarization. Apoptosis was also verified by acridine orange staining observed under fluorescence microscopy and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining through flow cytometric studies. The levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratio decreased, and the ATPase activity increased more strikingly in A549 cells exposed to NdBA than in A549 cells exposed to dBA. Overall results showed that both drugs directly target the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, with NdBA having a stronger effect, indicating NdBA to be a better candidate for the development of an anticancer drug for use against lung adenocarcinomas.

"This paper presents some previously proposed neurobiological mechanisms on how acupuncture may work in some clinical applications from a clinician's perspective. For the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, the proposed mechanisms included microinjury, increased local blood flow, facilitated healing, and analgesia. Acupuncture may trigger a somatic autonomic reflex, thereby affecting the gastric and cardiovascular functions. Acupuncture may also change the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, thereby affecting the emotional state and craving. This mechanism may form the basis for the treatment of smoking cessation. By affecting other pain-modulating neurotransmitters such as met-enkephalin and substance P along the nociceptive pathway, acupuncture may relieve headache. Acupuncture may affect the hypothalamus pituitary axis and reduce the release of the luteinizing hormone in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. In addition, two other approaches to the acupuncture mechanism, the fascia connective tissue network and the primo vascular system, are briefly reviewed. Finally, the idea of true versus sham acupuncture points, which are commonly used in clinical trials, is examined because the difference between true and sham points does not exist in the neurobiological model.

"In the present study, an ethanolic root-bark extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) was examined for its antiulcer potential in albino Wistar rats using two experimental models: ethanol-induced and pylorus ligation-induced gastric ulceration. The extract was orally administered at three different doses (150, 350, and 500 mg/kg) for 15 consecutive days. The antiulcer effects in rats treated with different doses of the extract and omeprazole (30 mg/kg, p.o.) were determined and compared statistically with the antiulcer effects in the control rats treated with saline (NaCl, 0.9%). The MO at doses of 350 and 500 mg/kg decreased the ulcer index significantly as compared to the control group (p < 0.01). The percentage protections against gastric ulcers were 82.58%, 85.13%, and 86.15% for MO doses of 150, 350, and 500 mg/kg, respectively, in the pylorus-ligated ulcer model and 55.75%, 59.33%, and 78.51%, respectively, in the ethanol-induced ulcer model. The MO significantly reduced the free acidity, total acidity, and ulcer index (p < 0.01) and increased the pH of gastric content compared with the control group. This study suggests that MO possesses valuable antiulcer, antisecretory, and cytoprotective activity. Thus, an ethanolic root-bark extract of Moringa oleifera can be used as source for an antiulcer drug. Moringa oleifera p p Moringa oleifera Moringa oleifera p p Moringa oleifera "
"In this study, we examined the antioxidative and the DNA protective potentials of apigenin, a flavonoid polyphenol isolated from Lycopodium clavatum, in both in-vitro (HaCaT skin keratinocytes) and in-vivo (mice) models against UV-B radiation. We used DAPI staining in UV-B-irradiated HaCaT skin keratinocytes pre-treated with and without apigenin to assess DNA damage. We also used a flow-cytometric analysis in mice exposed to UV-B radiation with or without topical application of apigenin to assess, through a comet assay, chromosomal aberrations and quanta from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Data from the stability curves for the Gibb's free energy determined from a melting-temperature profile study indicated that apigenin increased the stability of calf thymus DNA. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that apigenin caused a reduction in the number of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) after 24 h, the time at which the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes were activated. Thus, apigenin accelerated reversal of UV-B-induced CPDs through up-regulation of NER genes, removal of cyclobutane rings, inhibition of ROS generation, and down-regulation of NF-κB and MAPK, thereby revealing the precise mechanism of DNA repair.

"This article provides potential reasons for the past 45-year halt in research between the time of the Bonghan system of Bong Han Kim (B.H. Kim) and that of the primo vascular system (PVS) of Kwang-Sup Soh (K.S. Soh), briefly but more accurately in its history. Over the years, numerous questions related to the Bonghan system and the PVS have arisen, especially from researchers interested in pursuing PVS research: When and how did B.H. Kim's study results on the Bonghan system become known to public? Why did B.H. Kim and his publications disappear after 1966? Why was little study performed on the system for almost 50 years after Kim? Why and how was the research on the system reinitiated in 2002 by Kwang-Sup Soh? Why did the Bonghan system become the PVS? These questions, as well as technical difficulties in identifying the system, have discouraged many researchers from becoming involved in research on the system. The motivation for preparing this article was to remove doubts about the existence of this important organ, which might have been caused by its unusual and unclear historical background, by providing an accurate history.

"The burden of Alzheimer’s disease is continually rising globally, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Unfortunately, the efficacy of the therapeutic strategy is still very limited. Because the effect of acupuncture at HT7 can improve learning and memory, the beneficial effect of laser acupuncture, a noninvasive form of acupuncture, at HT7 on memory improvement in patients with Alzheimer’s disease has been a focus of research. To elucidate this issue, we used AF64A, a cholinotoxin, to induce memory impairment in male Wistar rats, which weighed 180–220 g. Then, the animals were treated with laser acupuncture either at HT7 or at a sham acupoint once daily for 10 minutes for a period of 14 days. Spatial memory assessments were performed at 1, 7, and 14 days after AF64A administration and at the end of the experiment, and the changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and in the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in the hippocampus were recorded. The results showed that laser acupuncture significantly suppressed AChE activity in the hippocampus. Although laser acupuncture enhanced SOD and CAT activities, no reduction in MDA level in this area was observed. Therefore, laser acupuncture at HT7 is a potential strategy to attenuate memory impairment in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. However, further research, especially on the toxicity of laser acupuncture following repetitive exposure, is essential. "
"The longitudinal distribution of the cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) produced by electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at acupuncture points (APs) located on the hind limbs of rats was analyzed in this study. Single electrical pulses (0.05 ms, 1 Hz) applied to the bladder (BL) and the gallbladder (GB) APs produced CDPs on several spinal segments and were composed of the following four components: an afferent volley, two negative components (N1 and N2), and one positive component (P wave). The larger evoked CDPs differed in their rostrocaudal distributions depending on the stimulated AP site, with those evoked by GB32–33 (at L3) and GB36–37 (at L4) being more caudal than those generated by BL58–59 (at L5) and BL37–38 (at L6). The CDPs produced by stimulating nonacupoints (NAPs) showed similar components and rostrocaudal distributions that were smaller in amplitude than those evoked by stimulating APs. The CDPs produced by stimulating NAPs located on a meridian acupuncture area were similar in amplitude and longitudinal distribution to those produced by stimulating APs. Our results suggest that the specificity of EA stimulation for CDPs responses is mainly related to an activation of meridian pathways associated with peripheral nerve routes rather than to a restricted point specificity of APs. 1 2 1 2 "
"This study investigated the effectiveness of electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA) at local and paravertebral acupoints for a rabbit undergoing an ovariohysterectomy. Twelve clinically healthy New Zealand white rabbits were chosen and divided into two groups: the control group (5 rabbits) and the experimental group (7 rabbits). A neuroleptanalgesic (ketamine + xylazine) was administered to the control group (NLA group); the experimental group received EAA treatment (EAA group). The EAA treatment includes one acupuncture formula for local stimulation at the incision site and systemic stimulation. Results of clinical research have shown postoperative analgesia using EAA treatment to be superior to that using NLA. The average postoperative recovery time was 5.2 times longer in the NLA group than in the EAA group. Because consciousness was maintained, EAA presented an advantage in thermoregulation. Animals administered NLA had prolonged thermal homeostasis because of neurovegetative disconnection. For the EAA group, the operative times were characterized as excellent (28%, p = 0.28) or good (72%, p = 0.72). Local stimulation at the incision site provided excellent analgesia of the abdominal wall (100%). In conclusion, EA can provide general analgesia with a considerable analgesic effect for a rabbit undergoing an ovariohysterectomy, resulting in a short postoperative recovery time. p p p p "
"Extract of Myrica cerifera bark has long been fruitfully used as a hepato-protective and anti-cancer drug in various complementary and alternative systems of medicine. Myricanone, its principal bioactive compound, had also been reported to have apoptosis-promoting ability. We evaluated its anti-cancer potential in vitro in HepG2 liver cancer cells and tried to understand the signal cascades involved in accomplishing apoptosis. Further, we ascertained by using a (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT) assay if it had cytotoxic effects on normal noncancerous liver cells (WRL-68). We deployed various tools and protocols, like phase contrast, scanning electron and fluorescence microscopies, performed an annexinV-FITC/PI assay and cell cycle analysis, and estimated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization through flow cytometry. Further, analyses of cytochrome-c translocation and of HSP70 and caspase expressions were also done by using immunoblota and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results revealed that myricanone induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells through generation of ROS, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, early release of cytochrome-c, down-regulation of HSP70 and activation of a caspase cascade; it had no, or insignificant, cytotoxic effects in WRL-68 cells in vitro and in mice in vivo. Thus, myricanone has great potential for use in formulating an effective drug against both hepatotoxicity and hepatocellular cancer.

"Electroacupuncture (EA) was investigated for lowering the blood glucose (BG) in fasting male obese Zucker fatty diabetic (ZDF) rats aged 10–17 weeks. Anesthesia provided satisfactory chemical restraint to enable repeated EA. Animals in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were anesthetized on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12. Group 1 (n = 4) received no EA (controls), Group 2 (n = 4) EA at Zhongwan and Guanyuan acupoints, and Group 3 (n = 4) EA at both Zusanli acupoints. BG was measured at 10 and 20 minutes, and EA was applied for 30 minutes, after which BG was measured again. Group 2 had a significantly lower baseline BG at 20 minutes on Days 5, 8 and 12 and significantly less change in BG over 30 minutes on Days 3 and 5 than Group 1 (p < 0.05). Group 3 showed a significant decrease in the mean baseline BG compared to Group 1 in Week 1 (p < 0.05). Thus, repeated EA using Zhongwan and Guanyuan acupoints was effective in lowering the baseline BG and modulating the change in the BG in anesthetized animals. n n n p p n n n p p "
"Cancer is a disease that needs a multi-faceted approach from different systems of medicine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether homeopathically-potentized ultra-high dilutions of Lycopodium Clavatum (LC-5C and LC-15C, respectively) have any anti-cancer effects on HeLa cells. Cells were exposed to either LC-5C (diluted below Avogadro's limit, i.e., 10−10) or LC-15C (diluted beyond Avogadro's limit, i.e., 10−30) (drug-treated) or to 30% succussed ethanol (“vehicle” of the drug). The drug-induced modulation in the percent cell viability, the onset of apoptosis, and changes in the expressions of Bax, Bcl2, caspase 3, and Apaf proteins in inter-nucleosomal DNA, in mitochondrial membrane potentials and in the release of cytochrome-c were analyzed by utilizing different experimental protocols. Results revealed that administration of LC-5C and LC-15C had little or no cytotoxic effect in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but caused considerable cell death through apoptosis in cancer (HeLa) cells, which was evident from the induction of DNA fragmentation, the increases in the expressions of protein and mRNA of caspase 3 and Bax, and the decreases in the expressions of Bcl2 and Apaf and in the release of cytochrome-c. Thus, the highly-diluted, dynamized homeopathic remedies LC-5C and LC-15C demonstrated their capabilities to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, signifying their possible use as supportive medicines in cancer therapy.

"Despite recent advances in anesthesiology and postoperative care, postoperative nausea and vomiting are common complaints. Although acupuncture techniques have received attention in anesthesiology, the ideal technique and selection of the most appropriate acupuncture points are still under debate. This study compared the efficacy of two simultaneous acupuncture points with that of a single point in the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting following general anesthesia through a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving 227 surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia who were randomly assigned into two groups. The first group received acupuncture by stimulation only on the PC6 point (single group), and the second group underwent concomitant stimulation of the PC6 and the L14 acupuncture points (combined group) during surgery under general anesthesia. The prevalences of postoperative nausea and vomiting were compared between the two groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups (p > 0.05). Of 115 patients in the combined group, 80 (69.6%) complained about nausea and vomiting compared with 96 (85.7%) in the single group, a significantly lower proportion (p < 0.05). Our findings favor a combination of PC6 and LI4 stimulation for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. p p p p "
"The purpose of this study was to trace the formative process of primo vascular system (PVS) research over the past decade and to describe the characteristics of the Korean scientific community. By publishing approximately 30 papers in journals ranking in the Science Citation Index (Expanded), the PVS research team actively convinced domestic and international scientists of the anatomical existence of the PVS and its possible application to Korean and Western medicine. In addition, by sharing the PVS observation technique, the team promoted the dissemination and further pursuit of the research. In 2012, however, PVS researchers performed smaller scale research without advancing to a higher level as compared to the early days. The main reasons were found to be the Korean Research and Development policy of supporting creative, small-scale basic research and applied research of Western scientific fields that promised potentially greater success on an extensive scale; the indifference concerning, and the disbelief in, the existence of a new circulatory system were shown by the Western medical community. In addition, the Oriental medical community was apathetic about working with the PVS team. Professors Kwang-Sup Soh and Byung-Cheon Lee were the prime movers of PVS research under difficult conditions. Spurred by their belief in the existence and significance of the PVS, they continued with their research despite insufficient experimental data. The Korean scientific community is not ready to promote the Korea-oriented creative field of the PVS team. "
"Contemporary Chinese pulse diagnosis™ (CCPD) is a system of pulse diagnosis utilized by Dr. John He Feng Shen, OMD, and documented by Dr. Leon Hammer, MD, in the book Chinese Pulse Diagnosis, A Contemporary Approach. It is the traditional method of the Ding medical lineage from the Shanghai region and dates to the 15th century in Chinese language texts. The fundamentals of this system are, however, much older and can be directly traced to the Neijing Suwen. Having been passed from the last direct inheritor of Ding knowledge (Dr. Shen) to modern practitioners of Chinese medicine by way of Dr. Hammer and his students, it represents an important system of advanced diagnosis. Although modern diagnostic technology provides very sophisticated diagnoses, for these instruments to be effective, the disease process must already have a physical manifestation. CCPD, on the other hand, provides the earliest warnings of physiological processes, which if left unchecked may result in the subsequent appearance of a disease. This article describes the derivation and the principles of this system of pulse diagnosis and explores its successful integration into the modern practice of Chinese medicine. "
"Limited research suggests that indirect moxibustion may be beneficial for treating fatigue, but no studies to evaluate direct moxibustion have been conducted in the United States. Thus, we explored the usefulness of four outcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of direct moxibustion for patients with spleen qi and yang deficiency fatigue (SQYDF). Eleven female volunteers, ages 25–60 years, were enrolled. Three to five rice grains in thread-sized moxa cones were burned on 11 acupuncture points once per week for 8 weeks. Eight participants completed the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were temporary worsening of fatigue, lightheadedness, and headache. Symptomatic improvement was seen on the SF-36 energy/fatigue scale (p = 0.003), SF-36 social function scale (p = 0.008) and Flinders fatigue scale (p = 0.014). The skin conductance at acupoints showed no consistent diagnostic baseline meridian patterns. Heart rate variability data showed an improved low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio in three of four participants. Direct moxibustion is safe in patients with SQYDF. The Flinders Fatigue Scale (FFS) and the SF-36 are useful outcome measures for evaluating the effects of direct moxibustion, and the heart rate variability (HRV) may be, but the skin conductance did not correlate with SQYDF diagnosis or with symptomatic improvement. qi yang p p p qi yang p p p "
"Acute dental pain is the main reason for seeking dental services to provide urgent dental care; there is consensus about the use of alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, to control dental pain in pre-dental care. This study aimed to evaluate the use of acupuncture in reducing the intensity of acute dental pain in pre-dental care in patients waiting for emergency dental care, and was conducted at the After-Hours Emergency Dental Clinic of Piracicaba Dental School, and at the Emergency Center Dental Specialties I in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. The sample consisted of 120 patients. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity. All patients underwent one session of acupuncture; the points LI4, ST44 and CV23 were selected and were used alone or in combinations. Reduction in pain was observed in 120 patients (mean initial VAS = 6.558 ± 1.886, p < 0; mean final VAS = 0.962 ± 2.163, p < 0.00001). The results of this study indicate that acupuncture analgesia could be a technical adjunct to pain control in patients with acute dental pain, contributing to the restoration of health with social benefit. p p p p "
"Traction therapy, which is known to be a treatment method for scoliosis, one of many muscles disease, has been used since Hippocrates introduced it. However, the effects of traction therapy are still not clear. In addition, the meridian sinew theory, which is related to muscle treatment and is mentioned in the book on meridian sinews in the Miraculous Pivot of Huangdi's Internal Classic, has not been the subject of much study. For these reasons, experimental spinal models were made for this study to observe and analyze the lengths of vertebral interspaces after intermittent traction therapy, which is known to be excellent among muscle treatment methods, with various tensile forces. The results showed that the effects of intermittent traction therapy were unclear and that it might be harmful, especially when the pain was induced by muscle weakness. Because the results of this study on intermittent traction therapy were different from those expected from osteopathy or craniosacral theory, better studies of the subject are necessary. "
"The fascia tissue, derived from the mesoderm, is distributed in all parts of the human body. It consists of connective tissues and stem cells. The fascia tissue is also believed to be a functional system, like the digestive system, in the human body, controlling self-inspection, self-maintenance, support, and storage. In addition, much of the research relevant to fascia tissue has focused on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which mainly exist in adipose tissues. The aim of this review is to summarize the current research on ADSCs, including a brief introduction of their biological characteristics, the isolation and expansion methods, a conclusion on their multidifferentiation potential, new clinical applications, and the therapeutic strategies for treating tumors.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic activity of Bacopa monniera with Rivastigmine against aluminum-chloride (AlCl3)-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into ten groups (n = 10) and subjected to their assigned treatments for 42 days. On the 20th day of the respective drug treatments, all the animals were trained in the Morris water maze (retention latency) and the elevated plus maze (transfer latency). After the initial training, the retention latency (RL) and the transfer latency (TL) were evaluated on the 21st and the 42nd days of the study. Chronic administration of AlCl3 caused significant memory impairment associated with increased RL in the Morris water maze task and increased TL in the elevated plus maze test. Interestingly, animals treated with oral administration of B. monniera (100 and 200 mg/kg), Rivastigmine (5 mg/kg) or a combination of B. monniera (100 mg/kg) with Rivastigmine (5 mg/kg) showed significant protection against AlCl3-induced memory impairment compared to animal treated with AlCl3 per se. Additionally, the neuroprotective effect of B. monniera (100 and 200 mg/kg) was significantly improved when supplemented with Rivastigmine (5 mg/kg). These findings suggest that treatment with a combination of B. monniera with Rivastigmine may be highly beneficial compared to their per-se treatment.

"This case series describes clinical findings in 100 horses displaying pain patterns resembling the anatomical course of the gall bladder meridian. The palpatory pain (tenderness) was detected in individual points, as well as along entire sections of the meridian. A few tender points and areas were also diagnosed outside of the meridian. These data are clinically relevant in terms of the diagnosis and classification of musculoskeletal pain in horses. Therapeutic trials will be reported in a subsequent study. "
"This study investigated the efficacies of electroacupuncture and electroacupuncture combined with Tao Hong Si Wu Wan in treating primary dysmenorrhea and compared the results with those obtained using conventional medical treatment. One treatment group, group 1, was administered Tao Hong Si Wu Wan (2625 mg) while the other, group 2, was administered a placebo (2625 mg) twice daily for 3 months. Electroacupuncture was used in both treatment groups: two sessions per menstrual cycle for three menstrual cycles. The reference group, group 3, was administered ibuprofen, 600 mg, twice daily, for five menstrual cycles. Uses of the herb, placebo and ibuprofen were blinded. A ridit analysis was used for testing and interpreting the effects of treatment. Pain intensity was determined using a qualitative grading method in a blinded manner. The ridit scores in groups 1 and 2 were significantly higher than those in reference group immediately after treatment and three months later. Twelve months after the treatment, group 1 had a higher ridit score than group 2. In comparison to the reference group, groups 1 and 2 achieved better menstrual pain relief both immediately and 3 months after treatment. In addition, group 1 had better long-term pain relief than group 2. Tao Hong Si Wu Wan Tao Hong Si Wu Wan Tao Hong Si Wu Wan Tao Hong Si Wu Wan "
"There is evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for chronic shoulder pain, but it remains unclear which acupuncture modes are most effective. We compared the effect of trigger point acupuncture (TrP), with that of sham (SH) acupuncture treatments, on pain and shoulder function in patients with chronic shoulder pain. The participants were 18 patients (15 women, 3 men; aged 42–65 years) with nonradiating shoulder pain for at least 6 months and normal neurological findings. The participants were randomized into two groups, each receiving five treatment sessions. The TrP group received treatment at trigger points for the muscle, while the other group received SH acupuncture treatment on the same muscle. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) and shoulder function (Constant–Murley Score: CMS). After treatment, pain intensity between pretreatment and 5 weeks after TrP decreased significantly (p < 0.001). Shoulder function also increased significantly between pretreatment and 5 weeks after TrP (p < 0.001). A comparison using the area under the outcome curves demonstrated a significant difference between groups (p = 0.024). Compared with SH acupuncture therapy, TrP therapy appears more effective for chronic shoulder pain. p p p p p p "
"Background Affecting more women than men, fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a rheumatic disorder characterized by chronic, diffuse and widespread musculoskeletal pain, and its pathogenesis is still unknown. Among the recommended treatments, acupuncture (for its analgesic effects) is an effective option for reducing the pain sensitivity and improving quality of life. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether acupuncture at tender points could effectively manage FMS. Methods Eight female patients, with a previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia, underwent an initial assessment involving pressure algometer measurements for pain tolerance and questionnaires [Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)], followed by treatment. Over a 2-month period, acupuncture was performed once per week at five tender points, located bilaterally at the occipital bone, trapezius, rhomboid, upper chest and lateral epicondyle. At the end of treatment, the participants underwent a reassessment for a final review of the applied methods. Results We observed a reduction in the pain threshold and sensitivity and improvement in the areas of anxiety and depression and quality of life, which were demonstrated using the FIQ, BDI and BAI but not the HAQ. Conclusion The results demonstrated the effectiveness of tender-point acupuncture treatment on the patients' overall well-being, not only by improving quality of life, but also by reducing the pain sensitivity of FMS.

"The purpose of this study was to suggest a new method of estimating acupoint compositions by using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA) method at 5 kHz, 50 kHz and 200 kHz within 2 cm of acupoints divided into local segments. To verify the system developed, we confirmed the stable occurrence of a constant current at every frequency, regardless of the impedance connected to the electrodes. Moreover, we found left and right distal bicep brachii aponeurosis to be identical by using ultrasound imaging, and we analyzed the repeatability of the findings by making 10 consecutive sets of measurements (p > 0.05). To evaluate the practical use of the acupoint composition, we used the MF-BIA analyzer to measure the left and right LU3, LU4, and LU9 at the lung meridian. We confirmed that the potentials generated were equal to the changes in the cell membrane function, which were caused by the applied frequency (p < 0.01). We also verified that the MF-BIA analyzer measurements corresponded to the acupoint components by comparing the left and right potentials generated (p > 0.05). Hence, we conclude that the MF-BIA analyzer can be used to estimate the acupoint composition based on the acupoint state. p p p p p p "
"Recent studies have found that many factors, both biological and operator induced, influence electrodermal measurements. Here, we report on operator variability for a series of measurements made by four operators at Jing-Well points on 132 individuals of both sexes (68 males and 64 females) by using the AcuGraph 3 ‘Digital Meridian Imaging Tool’: Operator 1 (16 males, 12 females), Operator 2 (18 males, 13 females), Operator 3 (15 males, 21 females), and Operator 4 (19 males, 18 females). The individuals studied were attending a yoga therapy program for type 2 diabetes mellitus and were assessed on the 1st day of treatment. Large inter-operator variations in overall acumeridian energy readings were observed. For individual meridians, the AcuGraph 3 measure differed by up to 42 points for minimum values and 67 points for maximum values. After normalization, the data showed similar patterns between different acumeridians. This suggested that variations were caused by operators applying different pressures when making measurements. Thus, inter-operator variability should be considered when interpreting electrodermal measurements made by several different operators. Unless inter-operator variability is taken into account, actual values may not have meaning; only then can readings for the same population taken by different operators be evaluated correctly. "
"There is currently a great deal of research interest in utilizing plant compounds against human diseases, including hypertension. The present study investigated the effects of different extracts and fractions from leaves of Gynura procumbens Merr. on rat atrial contraction in vitro. Isolated left and right atria, mounted in a 20-ml organ bath, were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min before the application of the extracts or fractions. The extracts (petroleum-ether extract (PE) and methanol extract (ME)) and the fractions (chloroform fraction (CHL), ethyl-acetate fraction (EA), n-butanol fraction (NB) and water fraction (WA) of the methanol extract) were tested at three concentrations (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml), with a β-adrenergic agonist (isoprenaline) as a control. All data on contraction responses were log-transformed and analyzed. When exposed to the different extracts, both atria tended to exhibit greater contractive responses with the NB whereas cardiac contractions had a tendency to be reduced with most other extracts. For a given extract, the contraction responses were particularly greater at 0.5 mg/ml for the right atrium and at 1 mg/ml for the left atrium. Further analysis focusing on the NB fraction revealed that positive inotropism was greater in left atria exposed to highly-concentrated F2 and F3 sub-fractions. Taken together, our results suggest that NB extracts and fractions from the G. procumbens-leaf methanol extract have positive inotropic activities and, hence, can be considered as an alternative/traditional medicine against increased blood pressure in humans or can be used in strategies aimed at finding antihypertensive biomolecules from an accessible source.

"This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the therapeutic effects of treatment for tic disorder and Korean medicine clinical tests, including body mass index (BMI) and heart variability rate (HRV). This study was not a clinical trial, but a data analysis of 87 tic patients who were treated for 6 months during the time period from Nov. 2010 to Jan. 2012. The clinical evaluation of the symptoms was recorded using the Korean version of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). The BMI and the HRV were measured according to a schedule, and various kinds of statistical methods were used. Among the 87 patients, the number of males was 3.34 times the number of females, and 58 patients (66.7%) had been suffering for more than 12 months. The onset age of the males was significantly lower than that of the females, and males had the symptoms longer than females had. Also, males with a family history of tics were 2.5 times as many as females, and their onset ages were substantially lower. At the first medical examinations, the average score on the YGTSS was 34.08, and it decreased linearly as the treatment progressed. After 4 and 6 months of treatment, it had decreased significantly. The YGTSS score and the period of suffering correlated positively. At the first visit, each HRV datum was in the normal range. After the 6 months' treatment, Ln (TP), Ln (LF), and Ln (HF) had dropped substantially in the normal range while Ln (VLF) and the LF/HF ratio had not changed in a meaningful way. During the treatment period, the BMI stayed relatively constant without any meaningful changes. "
"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in humans. It is believed that plants can provide potential bioactive compounds for the development of “new leads” to combat cancer and other diseases. The present study focuses on the ability of the different extracts (aqueous, methanol, and chloroform) of the leaves of Zea mays in influencing the process of apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Hep2 (laryngeal carcinoma) cells. Various apoptosis-related parameters, such as cell viability, morphological changes, nuclear changes, and apoptotic index were characterized. sulforhodamine B and MTT assays were used to quantify the extent of cell death in the group exposed to H2O2, plant extracts, and their combination. Treatment with H2O2 caused cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The administration of leaf extract also caused an increase in the death of cancer cells. Oxidatively stressed cancer cells co-treated with all the Z. mays leaf extracts (except the chloroform extract) demonstrated cytotoxicity on a par with the H2O2-treated groups. This indicated that the aqueous and methanol leaf extracts did not influence the cytotoxic action of H2O2 in the cancer cells. Thus, various apoptosis-related events in Hep2 cells exposed to leaf extract throw light on the potential anticancer activity of the Z. mays leaves. The maximum activity was exerted by the methanolic extract followed by the aqueous and chloroform extracts. Zea mays 2 2 2 2 2 2 Z. mays 2 2 2 2 Z. mays Zea mays 2 2 2 2 2 2 Z. mays 2 2 2 2 Z. mays "
"Background In spite of the extensive research on acupuncture mechanisms, no comprehensive and systematic peer-reviewed reference list of the stratified anatomical and the neuroanatomical features of all 361 acupuncture points exists. This study creates a reference list of the neuroanatomy and the stratified anatomy for each of the 361 acupuncture points on the 14 classical channels and for 34 extra points. Methods Each acupuncture point was individually assessed to relate the point's location to anatomical and neuroanatomical features. The design of the catalogue is intended to be useful for any style of acupuncture or Oriental medicine treatment modality. The stratified anatomy was divided into shallow, intermediate and deep insertion. A separate stratified anatomy was presented for different needle angles and directions. Results The following are identified for each point: additional specifications for point location, the stratified anatomy, motor innervation, cutaneous nerve and sensory innervation, dermatomes, Langer's lines, and somatotopic organization in the primary sensory and motor cortices. Acupuncture points for each muscle, dermatome and myotome are also reported. Conclusion This reference list can aid clinicians, practitioners and researchers in furthering the understanding and accurate practice of acupuncture. Additional research on the anatomical variability around acupuncture points, the frequency of needle contact with an anatomical structure in a clinical setting, and conformational imaging should be done to verify this catalogue.

"In a previous study, acupuncture at acupoint HT7 attenuated ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in rats by normalizing amygdaloid catecholamines. In the present study, the involvement of amygdaloid corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the anxiolytic effect of acupuncture was investigated during ethanol withdrawal. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with 3 g /kg/day of ethanol for 28 days, and the CRF mRNA levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) were measured by using a RT-PCR analysis 72 hours after the last dose of ethanol. During ethanol withdrawal, the rats were bilaterally treated with acupuncture at acupoints HT7, PC6 or at a non-acupoint (Tail) for one min/day for three days. Also, rats were bilaterally injected with CRF into the CEA five minutes after the third acupuncture treatment, after which followed by the elevated-plus maze (EPM) test and the plasma corticosterone radioimmunoassay (RIA) were administered. The RT-PCR analysis showed a significant increase in the amygdaloid CRF mRNA levels in the ethanol-withdrawn rats compared with both the saline-treated rats and the rats treated with acupuncture at HT7, but neither acupuncture at PC6 nor acupuncture at a non-acupoint significantly inhibited the increased mRNA expression. The EPM test and the RIA also showed that the post-acupuncture infusion of CRF greatly reduced the anxiolytic effect of acupuncture at HT7. These results suggest that during ethanol withdrawal, the anxiolytic effect of acupuncture may be mediated through the modulation of amydaloid CRF during ethanol withdrawal. "
"Orthosiphon stamineus is a popular folk medicine widely used to treat many diseases including diabetes. Previous studies have shown that the sub-fraction of chloroform extract was able to inhibit the rise of blood glucose levels in a glucose tolerance test. This study was carried out to evaluate the chronic effect and possible mechanism of action of the bioactive chloroform sub-fraction of O. stamineus using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in vitro methods. Administration of the chloroform extract sub-fraction 2 (Cƒ2-b) at a dose of 1 g/kg twice daily on diabetic rats for 14 days showed a significant lowering (p < 0.05) of the final blood glucose level compared to the pretreatment level. However, there were no significant differences in the plasma insulin levels post-treatment compared to the pretreatment levels for all doses of Cƒ2-b. Conversely, Cƒ2-b at a concentration of 2 mg/mL significantly increased (p < 0.001) the glucose uptake by the rat diaphragm muscle. The increase in glucose uptake was also shown when the muscle was incubated in a solution containing 1 IU/mL of insulin or 1 mg/mL of metformin. Furthermore, the effect of this sub-fraction on glucose absorption in the everted rat jejunum showed that Cƒ2-b at concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL and, 2 mg/mL significantly reduced the glucose absorption of the jejunum (p < 0.05–0.001). Similarly, the absorption of glucose was also inhibited by 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL of metformin (p < 0.001). These results suggest that the effect of Cƒ2-b may be due to extra-pancreatic mechanisms. There was no evidence that the plant extract stimulated the release of insulin in order to lower the blood glucose level.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate whether acupuncture can improve memory and reduce anxiety. Design, Setting and Subjects A two-group, randomized, single-blind study involving 90 undergraduate university students was conducted from January to December of 2011. Interventions Subjects completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form Y-1 (State Anxiety, SA) and Y-2 (Trait Anxiety, TA). Then, each subject lay on a treatment table for 20 minutes. The acupuncture group had needles inserted into select acupoints; control subjects did not. Subjects then completed the STAI form Y-1 again, after which they completed the Automated Operation Span Task (AOSPAN) - a computerized test of working memory. Main Outcome Measures Performance on the AOSPAN and the STAI scores were the main measures of the outcomes. Results The acupuncture group scored 9.5% higher than the control group on the AOSPAN Total Correct Score (65.39 vs. 59.9, p=0.0134), and committed 36% fewer math errors (2.68 vs. 4.22, p=0.0153). Acupuncture subjects also reported lower SA after intervention than control subjects (26.14 vs. 29.63, p=0.0146). "
"The aim of this study was to develop a new method of measuring the meridian energy potential (MEP) at an acupoint with bioelectrical impedance in order to establish an objective meridian diagnosis. To confirm the reflection of the changes in body composition at acupoints, the changes in the MEP on the bladder meridian before, during and after cupping were observed. Additionally, to evaluate the usefulness of diagnosis, the MEP on the stomach meridian before and after a meal was measured. Significant increases were found at every acupoint during cupping and after eating a meal. It was confirmed that the MEP data reflected changes in body composition at every acupoint and that these changes were associated with functioning of the associated internal organs. In conclusion, we propose the usefulness of this method, which can indicate the state of acupoints. "
"Although recent studies report that combined treatment of herbal drugs with acupuncture can improve clinical efficacy in traditional oriental medicine, experimental evidence that supports this pharmacopuncture therapy is rare thus far. Here, we investigated the effects of the herbal drug recipe Sciatica 5 (SCTA5) and acupuncture stimulation on gall bladder 30 (GB30) on regenerative responses of injured sciatic nerve in rats. Treatment of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with SCTA5 improved neurite outgrowth. In vivo regenerative responses, in terms of distal extension of regenerating axons and retrogradely-labeled DRG neurons, were improved by either injury site application of SCTA5 or GB30 acupuncture stimulation and further increased by SCTA5 pharmacopuncture on GB30 acupoint. Moreover, combined treatment of SCTA5 and GB30 was more effective than singular treatments in inducing Cdc2 kinase and accompanying vimentin phosphorylation in Schwann cells of the injured nerve. These results suggest that SCTA5 and GB30 therapies may be cooperative in facilitating axonal regeneration in the injured peripheral nerves. In vivo In vivo "
"The study was conducted to evaluate the safety of Sanyak (Dioscoreae rhizoma) pharmacopuncture by injecting to healthy participants. Among the subjective symptoms, pain after the injection was statistically significant in the group injected with alcohol extract of Sanyak. The mean platelet volume and blood in the urinalysis after the injections were statistically significant between groups. After injections, the total protein level in liver function tests and hematocrit changed significantly. However, all of these changes were within normal limits, and Sanyak pharmacopuncture did not cause any severe physical responses or subjective symptoms and may, therefore, be considered safe.

"The nucleus of the solitary tract (nucleus tractus solitarii; NTS) is a primary center for both visceral afferents and somatic afferents. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the NTS is closely connected to the stomach and acupoints in the Yangming Stomach Meridian of Foot (ST Meridian). In this study, extracellular recording and immunochemistry methods were used to analyze the discharge of neurons and c-Fos protein expression in the NTS following acupuncture at different acupoints and a nonacupoint. A total of 104 discharging neurons were detected in the NTS of 52 rats, of which 86 provided complete data. After acupuncture at Sibai (ST 2), Zusanli (ST 36), Neiting (ST 44), Quanliao (SI 18), and the nonacupoint, the neuron response rate in the NTS was 65.12%, 51.16%, 46.51%, 34.88% and 31.40% respectively. For neuron response rate, there was a significant difference among Sibai (ST 2), Zusanli (ST 36), Neiting (ST 44), Quanliao (SI 18), and the nonacupoint (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). In the other 48 rats, the number of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons in the NTS by electroacupuncture (EA) at Sibai (ST 2) group was significantly higher than that EA at other acupoints and the nonacupoint (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). EA at both Zusanli (ST 36) and Neiting (ST 44) increased c-Fos immunoreactive neurons significantly over EA at Quanliao (SI 18) and the nonacupoint (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), while there was no difference between EA at Quanliao (SI 18) and the nonacupoint group (p > 0.05). The experiments demonstrated that the afferent convergence in NTS are different by body surface points stimulus, which suggests that the NTS might be a primary center in the central nervous system receiving acupoints stimulus from the ST Meridian. nucleus tractus solitarii p p p p p p p nucleus tractus solitarii p p p p p p p "
"Text mining and other literature-based investigations can assist in identifying natural products for experimental and clinical research. This article details a method for systematically analyzing data derived from the classical Chinese medical literature. We present the results of electronic searches of Zhong Hua Yi Dian (“Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine”), a CD of 1000 premodern (before 1950) medical books, for single herbs, and other natural products used for dementia, memory disorders, and memory improvement. This review explores how the terminology for these disorders has changed over time and which herbs have been used more or less frequently, and compares the results from the premodern literature with the herbs indexed for memory disorders in a modern pharmacopoeia. The searches located 731 citations deriving from 127 different books written between ca. 188 ad and ca. 1920. Of the 110 different natural products identified, those most frequently cited for forgetfulness were yuan zhi (Polygala tenuifolia), fu shen (Poria cocos), and chang pu (Acorus spp.), all of which have been cited repeatedly over the past 1800 years and appear among the 31 herbs indexed in a modern pharmacopoeia.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritic and erythematous skin lesions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suppressive effects of anti-inflammatory and Rehmanniae radix pharmacopuncture on the development of AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. Rehmanniae radix The AD was induced on the mice's back skin by using biostir AD. The experimental groups were divided into three groups, PPI (anti-inflammatory pharmacopuncture), PPII (Rehmanniae radix pharmacopuncture, hydrodistillation extraction) and PPIII (Rehmanniae radix pharmacopuncture, MeOH extraction). All mice were treated using a 1-mL syringe to inject 0.1 mL of pharmacopuncture at right and left acupoints (BL13) on alternate days. In the control group, normal saline was used instead of pharmacopuncture. The following factors were investigated: (1) optical observations made with a handscope and clinical skin scores were evaluated; (2) tissue (general/immune) mast cells and CCR3+ eosinophils, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor immunoreactive changes were evaluated; (3) CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the spleen were immunohistochemically examined; and, (4) the serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E level and lymphokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4] were measured.

"Clinical observations reported that acupuncture can alleviate several kinds of arrhythmias. To explore its efficacy and mechanism, we have studied the electroacupuncture (EA) inhibition on experimental arrhythmias in rabbits since 1980s and analyzed its mechanism. These studies were mostly conducted in the Department of Physiology, Shanghai Medical University; recently the mechanism of acupuncture's effect on arrhythmias was analyzed in the School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, which involves the following: (1)the inhibitory effect of EA on ventricular extrasystoles can be induced by hypothalamic defense area stimulation: a low-current and low-frequency stimulation of the median nerve underneath acupoints P 5 or deep peroneal nerve underneath S 36 can activate arcuate nucleus–ventral periaqueductal gray –nuclei raphe pathway and release endorphin, enkephaline, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), etc., thus inhibiting the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM), decreasing sympathetic outflow, and alleviating ventricular extrasystoles; (2) the bradycardia induced by stimulation of aortic depressor nerve can be blocked by stimulation of superficial radial nerve (underneath LI 6–7) or superficial peroneal nerve (underneath G37–39): these stimulations activate the rVLM release opioids and GABA to inhibit nucleus tractus solitarius and vagal nuclei, and block vagal bradycardia. These experimental data explore the mechanism of acupuncture's effect on arrhythmias and are useful for clinical application. "
"The motion properties of the sanals of the primo vascular system were investigated under a low static magnetic field of 100 Oe. Sanals of about 1 μm were selected and separated from the primo vessels and nodes on a rabbit’s organ surface. The average velocity of five sanals in a physiologic saline solution parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field was approximately 1.0 pixel/second in random directions, which implies that the rotating motion of sanals with nuclei composed of DNA containing many inorganic magnetic elements such as manganese and cobalt is monotonically weakened by increasing an applied magnetic field.

"In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of ethanolic extract of the leaves of Senna surattensis (EESS) on α-glucosidase and α-amylase. We also studied the in vitro antidiabetic activity of S. surattensis using the glucose uptake by isolated rat hemidiaphragm model. In vitro studies using mammalian α-glucosidase extracted from the small intestine homogenate of mouse showed that the extract was found to be more effective in inhibiting the activities of maltase [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 209.15 μg/mL] and sucrase (IC50: 366.44 μg/mL) when compared with the control group (acarbose). The extract of S. surattensis were further quantified with respect to porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibition using the chromogenic 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. Interestingly, S. surattensis was also found to exhibit α-amylase (IC50: 123.95 μg/mL) inhibitory activity. The glucose uptake in the rat hemidiaphragm was significantly (p < 0.01) increased by EESS (220.95 ± 5.4 mg/g/30 minute) when compared with the control group. The total polyphenolic content of EESS was found to be 98 μg pyrocatechol/mg of the extract. These results suggest that EESS inhibited carbohydrate digestive enzymes and increased the peripheral uptake of glucose. This study endorses the use of this plant for further studies to determine their potential for managing type II diabetes.

"Recent findings have demonstrated that acupuncture and ginger can each improve memory impairment following cerebral ischemia. We hypothesized that ginger pharmacopuncture, a combination of these two treatments, could increase the beneficial effects. Due to the limitation of supporting evidence, we aimed to determine whether ginger pharmacopuncture could improve cognitive function and oxidative stress following cerebral ischemia. Male Wistar rats were induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (Rt. MCAO) and subjected to either acupuncture or ginger pharmacopuncture once daily over a period of 14 days after Rt. MCAO. Cognitive function was determined every 7 days, using escape latency and retention time as indices, and the oxidative stress status of the rats was determined at the end of the study. Rats subjected either to acupuncture or to ginger pharmacopuncture at GV20 demonstrated enhanced spatial memory, and the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus were improved. Elevation of superoxide dismutase activity was observed only in the hippocampus. Cognitive enhancement was observed sooner with ginger pharmacopuncture than with acupuncture. The cognitive enhancing effect of acupuncture and ginger pharmacopuncture is likely to be at least partially attributable to decreased oxidative stress. However, other mechanisms may also be involved, and this requires further study. "
"The present study evaluated the antioxidant activity of the fruit of Annona squamosa by means of in vitro studies involving two different solvent extracts: methanol and aqueous. The antioxidant properties of the extract were determined by scavenging 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH•), reducing power and total antioxidant. The results showed that, compared to aqueous extract, a methanolic fruit extract of A squamosa has a higher percentage of inhibition of DPPH radical scavenging activity (97.99%), LPO (94.15%), NO scavenging activity (70.96%), O2− scavenging activity and OH• scavenging activity (78.68% and 85.25%, respectively), total antioxidant activity (206 μg α-tocopherol/g) and reducing power (56.0 μg of ascorbic acid/g). The results obtained in the in vitro models clearly suggest that methanol extract has higher antioxidant activity than the aqueous extract due to a higher presence of phenolic and flavonodal constituents in the methanol extract.

"In South East Asia, groundwater arsenic contamination has become a great menace. Chronic arsenic intoxication leads to a hyperglycemic condition in animals and man. Because of undesirable side-effects and affordability, orthodox medicine, like insulin, is not preferred by many who like natural products instead. Unfortunately, such natural products mostly lack scientific validation. Therefore, we became interested in assessing the efficacy of the ethanolic seed extract of Syzygium jambolanum (SJ), traditionally used against diabetic conditions. We also formulated poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)-encapsulated nano-SJ (NSJ) and tested whether the ameliorative potentials of SJ could be enhanced by nano-encapsulation. In this study, we conducted both in vitro (in L6 cells) and in vivo (in mice) experiments to assess the relative efficacy of SJ and NSJ. We characterized the physico-chemical features of NSJ by atomic force microscopy and critically analyzed several bio-markers and signal proteins associated with arsenic-induced stress and hyperglycemia. We also determined the relative ameliorative potentials of SJ and NSJ by using standard protocols. NSJ could cross the blood brain barrier in mice. Overall results suggested that NSJ had a greater potential than that of SJ, indicating the possibility of using NSJ in the future drug design and management of arsenic-induced hyperglycemia and stress.

"It has clearly been established that oxidative stress leads to perturbation of various cellular processes resulting in either inhibition of cell proliferation or cell death. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required as signal molecules that regulate different physiological processes including survival or death. Free radicals, particularly ROS, have been proposed as general mediators for apoptosis and recent studies have established that the mode of cell death depends on the severity of the oxidative damage. In this study, we determined the effect of oxidative stress on cell proliferation and characterization of cell death in human KG1 cells treated with H2O2. Our results indicated that oxidative stress leads to a significant decrease in cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our study suggests that antiproliferative and apoptotic cell death effects of H2O2 took place via activation of caspase-3, affecting the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax (an antiapoptotic and a proapoptotic factor, respectively), and through deactivation of catalase enzyme, leading to accumulation of intracellular ROS and depletion of intracellular ATP level. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 "
"Two periods of primo vascular system (PVS) discovery exist. The first one includes the five reports of B. H. Kim made from 1962 to 1965. The second one is from 2002 until the present time and includes reports made mainly by the Seoul National University group using modern methods. The purpose of this article is to describe the claims in B. H. Kim's reports, to comment on the most important points of his claims, and to offer hypotheses for the morphological architecture and the function of the PVS. The PVS integrated the cardiovascular, nervous, and hormonal systems. Thus, the particularities of the various body systems are combined in the PVS. The PVS is not a simple circulatory system like the cardiovascular system. Its influence on all body systems is a combination of not only substances and signals but also energy and information. The primordial PVS is like a matrix for the vascular and the nervous systems, which are formed around the PVS. The PVS is duplicated by the vascular and the nervous systems in the very early stage of body development. This is the reason why the PVS combines the features of the vascular, the nervous, and the hormonal systems. Subsequently, all embryonic body systems have developed, the primordial PVS remains connected to them, but dominates and controls them as the primeval functional system. "
"Acupuncture is an ancient treatment modality that can trace its origins to as far back as 10,000 bc along the banks of the Yellow River in China. It involves the insertion of sharpened objects into specific areas of the body to achieve therapeutic effects. According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture modulates the flow of Qi and Xue through the meridians so that the main organs (Zhongs-Fus) will re-establish homeostasis as governed by the laws of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. In clinical practice, acupuncture is an efficacious treatment for alleviating acute and chronic pain, but a consensus on its underlying mechanisms is still lacking. This article presents an up-to-date review of the various neurophysiologic mechanisms that have been proposed to produce acupuncture-induced analgesia. bc Qi Xue Zhongs-Fus Yin-Yang bc Qi Xue Zhongs-Fus Yin-Yang "
"Objective This study aimed at assessing the adequacy of blood pressure (BP) control with the Chinese herbal fomentation at Yongquan point (K1). Method A total of 51 participants as a group were enrolled. In 10 participants as the subgroup, BP data were compared with those simultaneously recorded from the radial artery of the same side. After the baseline examination, each enrolled patient participated in one session lasting 24 hours, during which Yongquan point (K1) of both sides were fomented with a mixture of Chinese herbs. The technique of 24-hour Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was repeated at baseline and on the day after the therapy. Results The systolic and diastolic BP measured intra-arterially during the test were, on average, similar to those measured noninvasively. Patients obtained a 6.0 mmHg reduction for systolic BP and a 4.8 mmHg reduction for diastolic BP during daytime. The rate of adverse events was 2.0% in the group. Conclusion Our data demonstrated that BP recording by the ABPM method in our study provided a relatively accurate estimate of the average radial BP of the population. So the conclusion, “Chinese herbal fomentation at Yongquan point (K1) of both sides has some hypotensive potentials” was more reliable. "
"The aim of this experiment was to investigate the thermal properties of a new indirect ceramic moxibustion (ICM) in comparison with conventional indirect stick moxibustion (ISM) and to interpret the clinical implications of the data. A thermocouple was installed underneath each moxibustion unit to record temperature, and 10 units were burned for each moxibustion trial. The procedure began when the unit temperature reached 27 ± 1°C and finished when the temperature had returned to 27°C. The maximum unit temperature, time to reach maximum temperature, and duration of combustion were measured for each moxibustion modality. The maximum temperatures for ISM and ICM were 62.5 ± 2.59°C and 50.2 ± 2.53°C, respectively. The times to reach maximum temperature for ISM and ICM were 5.6 and 16.8 minutes, respectively. The two modalities exhibit different thermal properties as ISM showed a higher maximum temperature (p < 0.0001), which can immediately cause third-degree burns, and a steeper slope of temperature change. ICM, however, showed a lower maximum temperature, more slowly reached the maximum temperature (p < 0.0001), and had a longer and stable duration of combustion. This study suggests that ISM and ICM have statistically different thermal properties, and ICM showed safer thermal properties and a more stable heating pattern. Randomized controlled trials involving various moxibustion modalities are required for further clinical evaluation. p p p p "
"Primo vessels were observed inside the lymph vessels near the caudal vena cava of a rabbit and a rat and in the thoracic lymph duct of a mouse. In the current work we found a primo vessel inside the lymph vessel that came out from the tumor tissue of a mouse. A cancer model of a nude mouse was made with human lung cancer cell line NCI-H460. We injected fluorescent nanoparticles into the xenografted tumor tissue and studied their flow in blood, lymph, and primo vessels. Fluorescent nanoparticles flowed through the blood vessels quickly in few minutes, and but slowly in the lymph vessels. The bright fluorescent signals of nanoparticles disappeared within one hour in the blood vessels but remained much longer up to several hours in the case of lymph vessels. We found an exceptional case of lymph vessels that remained bright with fluorescence up to 24 hours. After detailed examination we found that the bright fluorescence was due to a putative primo vessel inside the lymph vessel. This rare observation is consistent with Bong-Han Kim’s claim on the presence of a primo vascular system in lymph vessels. It provides a significant suggestion on the cancer metastasis through primo vessels and lymph vessels. "
"Until now, even though intensive research has been dedicated to the primo vascular system (PVS) during these years, no statistical data on primo vessels and primo vessels in lymph flow have been available. Recently, the general morphological features of primo vessels in lymph vessels around the abdominal aorta were identified from microdissections of tissues from New Zealand White rabbits, and with Alcian blue staining, primo vessels in lymphatic vessels could be definitely identified under a digital microscope. The micro-dissected specimens in situ reveal rod-shaped nuclei stained by Acridine orange. The blue-stained nuclei, which were distributed in a broken-lined stripe, formed a tube structure of about 20 μm in diameter. The distance between the nuclei of two cells on neighboring aligned stripes, which is also the diameter of the micro tube, was measured to be about 5∼10μm. The average length of the primo vessels was 2.4 mm, with the longest being 5.6 mm. The average size of the primo vessel was 50 μm, and the average diameters of the primo and the lymph vessels were 26.0 μm and 258.5 μm, respectively. Occasionally, without the use of Alcian blue staining, milk-white transparent primo vessels were observed floating in lymph vessels. Thus, we suggest that the PVS might also have an important function connected with the lymph system. We also expect the traditional Korean meridian system to leave its invisible world during the last thousands of years and soon enter the visible scientific world. in situ in situ "
"The primo vascular system was recently observed in the central nervous systems of rabbits and rats, but no investigations in large animals have been reported. In the present work we found a putative primo vascular system in the spinal cord of a pig. We obtained spines from four healthy pigs and fixed them with paraformaldehyde. The primo vessels were expected to lie in the subarachnoid space between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. The composite of three membranes (the pia, the arachnoid, and the dura maters) wrapping the spinal cord was peeled off, isolated from the spine, and put on a slide glass. This composite was stained with 4′,6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and phalloidin to show the nuclei and the f-actin, respectively, in the cells of the primo vessels. We observed eleven pieces of the putative primo vessels in the subarachnoid space of the spines at the thoracic spinal nerve area. They had the typical rod-shaped nuclei distributed in a broken line, and f-actin signals around nuclei. The lengths of the nuclei were 12–15 μm, and the thicknesses of the primo vessels were 8∼20 μm, which were consistent with other primo vessels that had been observed in the various organs of rabbits, rats, and mice. In addition, we observed branching of the primo vessels, which is again an expected result from previous works. In conclusion, a primo vessel was observed in the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord of a pig. This was the first observation of a primo vessel in a large animal, and the staining method used to observe the primo vessel in a fixed sample was newly developed in this work. "
"The purpose of this review is to describe the methodology, instruments, and subject animals used until now for studies of the meridian (Kyungrak) system and the primo vascular system (PVS). The PVS is observed as an anatomical system distributed in cavities, organs, and tissues throughout the body. We analyzed the most important points of the PVS based on the results obtained until the present. Our main effort has been directed to describing the main thesis relating to the morphological structures and their topography, the functional mechanisms of the PVS, and possible roles of the PVS in pathological processes. The substance of the PVS in all its aspects is as a system covering the whole body and regulating and coordinating the biological processes that are the basis for life. In conclusion, we suggest that the finding of the PVS represents the discovery of a new integrated morphological-functional system. "
"Berberis integerrima is a member of Berberidaceae family. Berberine is one of the main constituents of this plant, having neuroprotective effect on central nervous system diseases. In this study, the anticonvulsant activity of methanolic extract, and hydromethanolic fraction, and chloroform fraction of B integerrima was assessed. The anticonvulsant effect of B integerrima was investigated using both pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizure models. The LD50 value of the methanolic extract was 302.676 mg/kg. In the PTZ test, methanolic extract (140 and 200 mg/kg, i.p., p < 0.01), hydromethanolic fraction (200 mg/kg, p < 0.01), and chloroform fraction (200 mg/kg, p < 0.01) increased the onset time of hind limb tonic extensions (HLTEs). The protective effect against mortality (convulsion survivors/animals tested) was 2/8 in methanolic extract, and 3/8 in hydromethanolic fraction at a dose of 200 mg/kg and in chloroform fraction at a dose of 140 mg/kg. In the MES test, this plant did not display any significant effect in reducing HLTE duration. According to phytochemical screening, methanolic extract contained alkaloids and tannins. The present study, conducted in mice, indicated that B integerrima has anticonvulsant activity in PTZ-induced seizures. It is concluded that B integerrima may be useful in petit mal epilepsy.

"Nigella sativa L. is used as a galactagogue in traditional medicine. Hence, the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of N. sativa seeds on milk production in rats were evaluated. The measurement of milk production was by measuring pup weight during suckling period. The intraperitoneal LD50 values of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of N. sativa were 4.23 and 4.9 g/kg, respectively. The aqueous (0.5 g/kg) and ethanolic extracts (1 g/kg) increased milk production significantly (p < 0.001), producing about 31.3% and 37.6% more milk than control, respectively. During the study period, the pups gained weight with the aqueous (0.5 g/kg, p < 0.01) and ethanolic extracts (1 g/kg, p < 0.05). It is concluded that aqueous and ethanolic extracts of N. sativa can stimulate milk production in rats.

"Violet laser acupuncture was recently described by our research group. Neurochemical studies of acupuncture analgesia revealed that 2- and 100-Hz peripheral stimulation induce differential peptide release from preproenkephalin and preprodynorphin via different neural pathways. The goal of the fifth part of this series was to perform a pilot investigation on the effects of 2- and 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture on heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) in 13 healthy volunteers (mean age ± standard deviation: 23.9 ± 1.7 years) using a new non-invasive method. We found a significant difference in mean HR before, during, and after 2- or 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture, and there was a significant difference of the low frequency/ high frequency ratio before, during, and after 2- or 100-Hz violet laser acupuncture. However, we did not observe a significant difference in total HRV before, during, or after treatment. Further studies should be carried out to compare the effects of different violet laser acupuncture frequencies. "
"The primo vascular systems (PVS) observed in the central nervous system have been limited to the ones floating in the cerebrospinal fluid. In those experiments, it was difficult to obtain the same results because the PVS was not fixed in a given anatomical position. In the current work, we report a finding of a PVS in a well-defined location, namely, underneath the superior sagittal sinus in the sagittal fissure, so that repetition of the experiments is possible. This provides a cornerstone for PVS research because the lack of reproducible sample-taking hindered a deeper study of the PVS, such as RNA sequencing or RNA microarray. This obstacle can be overcome through the discovery in the current work. This PVS showed characteristics of the PVS observed in other organs. It showed the bundle structure of subvessels, the parallel distributions of F-actins, and the rod-shaped nuclei. Furthermore, it had a primo node in front of the confluence of sinuses above the pineal body. It had branches shooting off from the main primo vessel in the subarachnoid space toward the cerebral hemispheres. The results indicate that this PVS underneath superior sagittal sinus has proper features to function as a flowing channel. "

"Molecular-level understanding of the structure and the functions of the lymphatic system has greatly enhanced the importance of this second circulation system, especially in connection with cancer metastasis and inflammation. Recently, a third circulatory system, the primo vascular system (PVS) was found in various parts of an animal's body, especially as threadlike structures floating in the lymphatic flow in lymph vessels. Although the medical significance of this emerging system will require much work in the future, at present, several important suggestions in connection with immune cells, stem cells, and cancer metastasis have already appeared. Experiments to observe the PVS in the lymph vessels near the caudal vena cava of rabbits and rats have been performed by several independent teams, but reproduction requires considerable skill and technical know-how. In this article, we provide a detailed protocol to detect the PVS inside the lymph vessels of a rabbit. Detection and isolation are the first steps in unraveling the physiological functions of the PVS, which awaits intensive research. "
"By spraying and injecting Alcian blue into the lateral ventricle, we were able to visualize the network of the nerve primo vascular system above the pia mater of the brain and spine of rats. Staining these novel structures above the pia mater with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole demonstrated that they coexisted in cellular and extracellular DNA forms. The cellular primo node consisted of many cells surrounded by rod-shaped nuclei while the extracellular primo node had a different morphology from that of a general cell in terms of DNA signals, showing granular DNA in a threadlike network of extracellular DNA. Also, differently from F-actin in general cells, the F-actin in the primo vessel was short and rod-shaped. Light and transmission electron microscopic images of the PN showed that the nerve primo vascular system above the pia mater of the brain and spine was a novel dynamic network, suggesting the coexistence of DNA and extracellular DNA. Based on these data, we suggest that a novel dynamic system with a certain function exists above the pia mater of the central nerve system. We also discuss the potential of this novel network system in the brain and spine as related to acupuncture meridians and neural regeneration. "
"A systematic review on studies related to the genetic characteristics of Sasang types was conducted with the goal of delineating genetic characteristics of Sasang typology. Six electronic databases of up to the March 2011 were examined with the key words of Sasang typology, constitution, and genetics in both Korean and English. Predefined review criteria were used, including demographic characteristics, type classification methods, genotyping methods, and genotypes. Fifty-nine potentially relevant studies were identified and 40 peer reviewed research articles that contained genetic data were included. Fourteen articles reported statistically significant differences among Sasang types, which are heritability, structural variation, genome-wide screening, and pathophysiological function. Although significant genotypes were reported with vWA, CSF1PO, Penta D, HLA-Cw*04, HLA-Cw*07, PPAR-γ, MDR1, IL-α, IL-β, and IL-6 receptor, results of the review indicate that there was no conclusive genotype related to the Sasang typology. Considering the features of Sasang typology, it is recommended that the macroscopic systems medical approach on genetics be employed, rather than the single genes association approach.

"According to Bonghan Kim's theory of anatomical reality for acupuncture meridians, DNA microgranules known as Sanals are key functional components in the primo vascular system (formerly the Bonghan system). To investigate this issue, we developed a new system, an incubator bound to a phase-contrast microscope, in which we cultivated and then observed for 10 hours microgranules taken from 3-day-old chick embryos and from blastoderms of fertilized chicken eggs. With this system, we found that, over time, the microgranules grew in circular patterns to become cell-like structures. In the embryo specimens, we found two distinctive microgranule growths, which developed into cell-like structures over 10 hours. In the first case, a microgranule of about 1.0 μm in size developed into a 3.3-μm-sized cell-like structure, with a pattern of concentric circles. The growth rate of the diameter of the first microgranule was, on average, 0.23 μm/hour. In the second case, a 2.5-μm-sized microgranule developed into a 5.4-μm-sized cell-like structure, which also exhibited a pattern of concentric circles. The average growth rate of the diameter of the second microgranule was 0.31 μm/hour. In the blastoderm specimens from the fertilized chicken egg, we also found three distinctive concentric growths. Interestingly, one of the three blastoderm microgranules grew very quickly, from about 2.5 μm in size to about 5.5 μm in size during 5 minutes of incubation. This was followed by steady growth to about 7.0 μm in size during the next 10 hours of incubation. In the final step of our investigation, we confirmed that the cell-like structures that had grown from the microgranules stained by acridine orange had DNA signals. We believe that the data obtained with our experimental method provide a clue that a mitosis-free alternative pathway for cell formation may, indeed, exist. We also suggest that this new function of microgranules (Sanals) might be related with the acupuncture meridian called the primo vascular system. "
"Introduction Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is sensory and motor nerve damage to the peripheral nervous system caused by chemotherapeutic agents. It often causes pain and other varying degrees of neuropathic symptoms accompanied by functional limitations and reduced quality of life. Currently, there is no standard treatment protocol for the treatment of CIPN. Objective In need of more research to develop new therapeutic options focusing on their safety, efficacy, and long-term sustained clinical effects, a pilot study of sweet bee venom pharmacopuncture (SBVP) for CIPN was conducted to build up preliminary efficacy data in the process of preparing for a future larger scale randomized controlled SBVP trial for CIPN. Methods We conducted a prospective case series by analyzing the clinical observations made of CIPN patients treated with SBVP. A total of 11 eligible consecutive CIPN patients who visited East-West Cancer Center from June 1, 2010, to February 28, 2011, were treated with total of six SBVP treatments given within the 3-week period. The outcomes were measured using World Health Organization Common Toxicity Criteria for Peripheral neuropathy (WHO grading system), Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), Visual Analogue System (VAS), and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) collected at the baseline, post-second, fourth, and the final treatment. Patients were followed 3 weeks into no intervention to determine the sustained effects of pharmacopuncture. Results Both of the WHO CIPN grade and PNQ scores have shown a decrease in the level of neuropathy. VAS pain level has also shown a great decrease and improvement in patients' quality of life have also been detected though modest. Changes in WHO grade, VAS and Total HRQOL scores between the baseline and after the last treatment session were significant. Changes in WHO grade, Total PNQ, PNQ-sensory, VAS, Total HRQOL, and HRQOL-functional scores between the baseline and the 3-week follow-up were significant. Conclusion The positive result of the study supports the potential value of conducting a fully powered trial to explore further efficacy of SBVP for CIPN. However a single positive result within this pilot study must be interpreted with caution. "
"Acupuncture is one of the key therapeutics in clinical oriental medicine, and recent studies using experimental animals have begun to provide the pathophysiological basis for the efficacy of acupuncture. Here, we investigated neuronal responses in rodent models given acupuncture stimulation. In both mice and rats, acupuncture stimulation at zusanli (ST36) generated an increased expression of axonal growth-associated protein (GAP-43) in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Electroacupuncture stimulation at ST36 in rats induced GAP-43 mRNA and protein expression in DRG neurons at the levels of lumbar 4 and 5. Stimulation on a non-acupuncture site as a sham control induced GAP-43 expression as well, but the induction level was lower than it was with acupuncture. We further found that acupuncture stimulation upregulated phospho-Erk1/2 signals in DRG neurons. Electroacupuncture stimulation induced c-Fos expression in the neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV), which was identified by retrograde tracing. These data suggest that acupuncture stimulation may generate physiological effects on the autonomic nervous system via the activation of a somatosensory pathway. "
"Orthosiphon stamineus extracts contain three flavonoids (3′-hydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, sinensetin, and eupatorin) as bioactive substances. Previous reported high performance liquid chromatography- ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) methods for the determination of these flavonoids have several disadvantages, including unsatisfactory separation times and not being well validated according to International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) standard guidelines. A rapid, specific reversed-phase HPLC method with isocratic elution of acetonitrile: isopropyl alcohol: 20 mM phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4) (30:15:55, v/v) (pH 3.5) at a flow-rate of 1 ml/minute, a column temperature of 25°C, and ultraviolet (UV) detection at 340 nm was developed. The method was validated and applied for quantification of different types of O stamineus extracts and fractions. The method allowed simultaneous determination of 3′-hydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, sinensetin, and eupatorin in the concentration range of 0.03052–250 μg/ml. The limits of detection and quantification, respectively, were 0.0076 and 0.061 μg/ml for 3′-hydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, 0.0153 and 0.122 μg/ml for sinensetin and 0.0305 and 0.122 μg/ml for eupatorin. The percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) values for intraday were 0.048–0.368, 0.025–0.135, and 0.05–0.476 for 3′-hydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, sinensetin, and eupatorin, respectively, and those for intraday precision were 0.333–1.688, 0.722–1.055, and 0.548–1.819, respectively. The accuracy for intraday were 91.25%–103.38%, 94.32%–109.56%, and 92.85%–109.70% for 3′-hydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, sinensetin, and eupatorin, respectively, and those for interday accuracy were 97.49%–103.92%, 103.58%–104.57%, and 103.9%–105.33%, respectively. The method was found to be simple, accurate and precise and is recommended for routine quality control analysis of O stamineus extract containing the three flavonoids as the principle components in the extract.

"The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether potentized cholesterinum (Chol) intermittently used with another homeopathic remedy, Natrum Sulphuricum (Nat Sulph) can provide additional benefits in combating hepatotoxicity generated by chronic feeding of carcinogens, p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (p-DAB), and phenobarbital (PB). Mice were categorized into subgroups: normal untreated (Gr-1); normal + alcohol “vehicle” (Alc) (Gr-2), 0.06% p-DAB +0.05% PB (Gr-3), p-DAB+PB+Alc (Gr-4), p-DAB+PB+Nat Sulph-30 (Gr-5), p-DAB+PB+Chol-200 (Gr-6), p-DAB+PB+Nat Sulph-30+Chol-200 (Gr-7), p-DAB+PB+Nat Sulph-200 (Gr-8), and DAB+PB+Nat Sulph-200+Chol-200 (Gr-9). Hepatotoxicity was assessed through biomarkers like aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT), acid and alkaline phosphatases (AcP and AlkP), reduced glutathione content (GSH), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and analysis of lipid peroxidation (LPO) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days and antioxidant biomarkers like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) were assayed. Electron microscopic studies (scanning and transmission) and gelatin zymography for matrix metalloproteinases were conducted in liver. The feeding of the homeopathic drugs showed intervention in regard to the increased activities of AST, ALT, AcP, AlkP, GGT, LDH, and LPO and decreased activities of G6PD, SOD, CAT, GR, and GSH noted in the intoxicated mice, more appreciable in Groups 7 and 9. Thus, combined therapy provided additional antihepatotoxic and anticancer effects. "
"The rising incidence of chronic disease and stress-related illness in the West, coupled with an expanding awareness of the unwanted side effects of pharmaceutical treatment, has led to an increased utilization of acupuncture as a contemporary health care option. This increase in utilization, in turn, has paralleled a response to the call for evidence, with the result that acupuncture is now supported by a broad range of surveys of safety, clinical trials and basic science studies of physiologic action. The combined impact of these studies is linked to a growing acceptance of this traditional medical practice. The present review takes a wide-angle look at these three major areas of acupuncture research, namely: safety and the risks of serious adverse events; clinical efficacy and effectiveness; and physiologic action. We identify advances in knowledge and present a point counterpoint approach to controversial issues, with the aim of offering clarification if not a measure of resolution. "
"Thymus species are known to have significant amounts of phenolic and flavonoid compounds and exhibit strong antioxidant activities. This work was designed to evaluate the antioxidant activities of three endemic Iranian Thymus species (including T. daenensis, T. kotschyanus, and T. pubescens) in different test systems [namely DPPH (2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS+ [2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid], and linoleic acid/β-carotene bleaching assays] to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the species (assayed by colorimetric techniques) and to study the possible composition-activity relationship. All the tested plants exhibited concentration-dependent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. T. pubescens showed the highest free radical scavenging activities in both DPPH and ABTS+ methods, while T. daenensis and T. kotschyanus were the most active species in the β-carotene bleaching inhibition test. Alternatively, T. pubescens exhibited a significantly higher level of the total flavonoid content compared with those of the other species, while no significant statistically differences were found among the tested plants regarding the total phenolic content. In addition, significant correlations were found between the flavonoid content and DPPH/ABTS+ radical scavenging activities, but not between the β-carotene bleaching inhibition system and the flavonoid content.

"The placebo effect has evolved from being thought of as a nuisance in clinical research to a biological phenomenon worthy of scientific investigation. The study of the placebo effect and of its evil twin, the nocebo effect, is basically the study of the therapeutic ritual around the patient, and it plays a crucial role in the therapeutic outcome. In recent years, different types of placebo responses have been analyzed with sophisticated biological tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at the neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cellular levels. Most of our knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms of the placebo response comes from pain and Parkinson's disease, whereby the neuronal networks involved in placebo responsiveness have been identified. In the first case, opioid, cannabinoid, and cholecystokinin circuits have been found to be involved. In the second case, dopaminergic activation in the striatum and neuronal changes in basal ganglia have been described. This recent research has revealed that these placebo-induced biochemical and cellular changes in a patient's brain are very similar to those induced by drugs. This new way of thinking may have profound implications in clinical trials and medical practice both for pharmacological interventions and for nonpharmacological treatments such as acupuncture. "
"In this study, the antioxidative potential of a hydroalcoholic extract of Nardostachys jatamansi (NJE) rhizomes was evaluated by various antioxidant assays, including antioxidant capacity by the phosphomolybdenum method, total antioxidant activity in linoleic acid emulsion systems, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide (NO) scavenging, metal chelating and reducing power activity. These various antioxidant activities were compared with standard antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene, tocopherol, catechin, and L-ascorbic acid. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of NJE was also determined by a colorimetric method. The extract exhibited high reduction capability and powerful free radical scavenging, especially against DPPH and superoxide anions as well as a moderate effect on NO. Moreover, the peroxidation inhibiting activity of NJE was demonstrated in the linoleic acid emulsion system. The results obtained in the present study clearly established the antioxidative potency of NJE, which may account for some of the medical claims attributed to this plant.

"In this study, we demonstrate that the direct application of moxibustion significantly enhances muscle regeneration in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Twelve Dilute Brown Non-Agouti (DBA)/1 J male mice were randomly divided into the following groups: intact control (n = 4), CIA (n = 4), and CIA with moxibustion treatment (CIA + moxi, n = 4). Mice in the CIA and CIA + moxi groups were immunized twice via intradermal injections of bovine type II collagen (C II) at 3-week intervals. After the second injection, moxibustion was applied to the mouse equivalent of the BL24 and ST36 acupoints with a moxa cone five times/day, every other day (except Sundays), for 3 weeks (a total of 9 treatments were administered). Phospho-Erk1/2, myostatin, TFG-B1, and IGF-1 were analyzed using ELISA. Protein levels in skeletal muscle tissues of the hind limb were analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. n n n Treatment with direct moxibustion led to a marked improvement in CIA and atrophy of individual muscle fibers. Collagen protein signaling in the muscle of the CIA group was stronger than the control and CIA + moxi groups. Myostatin protein expression, as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining, were stronger in the CIA group compared with the control and CIA + moxi groups. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that the CIA group had the strongest TGF-B1 protein signals among the three groups. However, in serum analysis the intact control group showed the strongest TGF-B1 protein signaling. RT-PCR analysis of the muscle tissues of the CIA + moxi group showed significant IGF-1 mRNA expression, and the most intense phospho-Erk1/2 protein signaling was detected in the muscle tissues of the CIA group via Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. These results confirm that the direct administration of moxibustion at Shenshu (BL 23) and Zusanli (ST 36) influences muscle regeneration in the CIA mouse model. Our results suggest that the establishment of the moxibustion mechanism will encourage the clinical application of moxi. Shenshu Zusanli n n n Shenshu Zusanli "
"We compared the effects of trigger point acupuncture with that of sham acupuncture treatments on pain and oral function in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). This 10-week study included 16 volunteers from an acupuncture school with complaints of chronic temporomandibular joint myofascial pain for at least 6 months. The participants were randomized to one of two groups, each receiving five acupuncture treatment sessions. The trigger point acupuncture group received treatment at trigger points for the same muscle, while the other acupuncture group received sham treatment on the trigger points. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale) and oral function (maximal mouth opening). After treatment, pain intensity was less in the trigger point acupuncture group than in the sham treatment group, but oral function remained unchanged in both groups. Pain intensity decreased significantly between pretreatment and 5 weeks after trigger point (p < 0.001) and sham acupunctures (p < 0.050). Group comparison using the area under the curve demonstrated a significant difference between groups (p = 0.0152). Compared with sham acupuncture therapy, trigger point acupuncture therapy may be more effective for chronic temporomandibular joint myofascial pain. p < p < p p < p < p "
"The ethanol extract of the roots of Aerva persica (Burm f) Merrill (Amaranthaceae) was investigated to determine its antiulcer and in vivo antioxidant activities in albino Wistar rats. Ulcers were induced by ethanol and pylorus ligation. The extract was administered at the dose of 200 mg/kg orally, p.o. for 15 consecutive days. The ulcer index of the ethanol extract was found to be significantly reduced compared with control animals. The effect was also assessed by determining the free acidity, pepsin activity, total carbohydrate (TC), and protein content (PK) in control, standard, and test group animals. The in vivo antioxidant activity was evaluated by determining the reduced glutathione level (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the tissue homogenates. The results reveal the significant reduction in the level of malondialdehyde and the increase in the level of reduced glutathione in the rats that received the ethanolic extract. Furthermore, histopathological studies have shown that pretreatment with the ethanolic extract of the roots of A persica reduces (100%) ethanol- and pylorus ligation-induced hemorrhagic necrosis in rats.

"Objective To explore the mechanism of Toll-like receptor (TLR4) inhibition in the delay of formation of atherosclerosis by herb-partition moxibustion. Method Seventy-five rabbits were randomly assigned to one of five groups: blank, atherosclerosis (AS) model, direct moxibustion, herb-partition moxibustion, and drug treatment. With the exception of the blank group, all rabbits were given a high-fat diet in addition to immunologic injury to create the AS model. The experiments were carried out for 16 weeks, at which time the aorta was removed from each rabbit. Immunohistochemical methods were used to detect the gray level of the aortic TLR4 to observe the immunologic competence of its antigens. Fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of TLR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the aorta. Results The gray-scale value of TLR4 and the TLR4 mRNA expression significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the direct moxibustion, herb-partition moxibustion, and drug treatment groups. Furthermore, the effects of the herb-partition moxibustion and drug treatment were superior to those of the direct moxibustion. p p Conclusion Herb-partition moxibustion inhibits aortic TLR4 activity and mRNA expression, showing that herb-partition moxibustion delays the formation of atherosclerosis through the inhibition of TLR4 expression.

"In searching for a new material made from natural resources that could be used as a whitening agent, we focused on the plants used for skin treatment by the native people of East Kalimantan. The methanol extract of the leaves of Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl showed antimelanogenesis activity in a melanin biosynthesis assay. By activity-guided fractionation, 7-methoxycoumarin (1) was isolated as an active compound. The IC50 of 1 on mushroom tyrosinase was 2360 μM (L-tyrosine was used as the substrate) and above 2840 μM (L-DOPA was used as the substrate), respectively. Regarding melanin formation inhibition in B16 melanoma cells, the IC50 of 1 was 1780 μM with 83% cell viability at IC50. Based on these results, we validated that the leaf extract is in line with the traditional use of the Dayak tribe in East Kalimantan.

"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of electroacupuncture at Zusanli on the immunohistochemical density of enteroendocrine cells related to gastrointestinal function. The authors investigated the histochemical changes of mucous substances and immunohistochemical density of gastrin, serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), insulin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secreting cells in rats. Staining density of mucous substances and the enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract was observed with histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Stainless steel needles with a diameter of 0.25 mm were inserted into Zusanli (St36, 5 mm below the head of the fibula under the knee joint, and 2 mm lateral to the anterior tubercle of the tibia) and connected to an electrical stimulator. The electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation was delivered for 30 minutes at 10 mA, 2 Hz in EA stimulation (2EA group) or 4 Hz in EA stimulation (4EA group) in each experimental group. In 4EA stimulation at the Zusanli, staining density of Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff on mucous substances of the stomach body was stronger than those of the 2EA and control groups. Periodic acidi-Schiff staining density of pyloric mucosa in the 4EA group was stronger than that of the 2EA and control groups. The immunohistochemical staining density of gastrin, serotonin, and CGRP-secreting cells of pylorus in the 2EA and 4EA groups was stronger than that of the control group. Immunohistochemical staining density of insulin and PP secreting cells of islets of the pancreas in the 2EA and 4EA groups was stronger than that of the control group. These results suggest that EA stimulus at St36 has the potential to influence gastric mucous substances and enteroendocrine cells (gastrin, serotonin, CGRP, insulin, and PP) that subsequently modulate digestive functions.

"Periodontal diseases continue to be most commonly occurring oral diseases in modern times. Many therapeutic modalities have been tried and tested to relieve these problems. The conventional therapy—scaling and root planing (SRP)—stands out to be the most used mode of treatment, and other treatments remain applicable as adjuncts to SRP, including acupuncture, acupressure, and aromatherapy. The present article discusses the applications of the abovementioned therapeutic modes and their relevance in current scenarios. Alternative medicine may be preferred as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy to relieve pain, bad breath, gingival inflammation, mouth ulcers, and mouth sores. "
"Electrical stimulation at acupuncture points (acupoints) has been investigated for its utility in lowering blood glucose in hyperglycemic humans and animal models. Only two studies were found using electroacupuncture in human subjects, and in both of these, the participants were normal (nondiabetic) and electrical stimulation was carried out at several acupoints. It had a hypoglycemic effect in obese women with calorific restriction diet using electrical stimulation of 2 Hz for 30 minutes/day for 20 days, but no change occurred in blood glucose of fasted patients in the other study using 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Fourteen animal studies were found, of which, 11 were performed in diabetic and normal rats. A hypoglycemic effect was observed in fasted type 1 diabetic rats using the Zusanli (ST36) leg acupoint with electrical stimulation of 15 Hz for 30 minutes and 60 minutes. In fasted type 2 diabetic rats, blood glucose was lowered using the Zusanli acupoint with electrical stimulation parameters of 15 Hz and 10 mA for 30 minutes. Also, using the Zhongwan (CV12) abdomen acupoint with electrical stimulation parameters of 15 Hz and 10 mA for 90 minutes had a hypoglycemic effect in fasted type 2 diabetic rats. In fasted normal rats, electrical stimulation of 2 Hz or 15 Hz for 30 minutes at the Zusanli or Zhongwan acupoint caused a decrease in blood glucose. Future studies are required in fasted diabetic rats to determine the effect of electroacupuncture on blood levels of insulin, lipids, fatty acids and β-endorphin, and blood flow and nerve conduction velocity. Studies with fasted normal and diabetic human subjects treated by electroacupuncture are warranted using data from animal experiments to inform such studies. "
"Mammalian bodies are hierarchical systems whose internal cooperation and coherent activity require high capacity information transfer between the central control unit – the brain – and the periphery – the organs. A communication system capable of meeting information capacity requirements should be based on transmission of electromagnetic signals. Structures that fulfill requirements for such information transfer have not yet been analyzed. Acupuncture meridians have been demonstrated experimentally in some animals. They might represent systems of information transfer between the brain and the peripheral organs. The ducts of the meridians may correspond to optical fibers operating from the far infrared to the visible wavelength region. The main features of a model of the duct as an optical fiber are delineated and its properties outlined. However, to analyze essentials of the transmission capabilities, the whole meridian structure should be mapped and a more comprehensive set of physical parameters measured. In particular, experimental data concerning morphological arrangements of ordered water in the ducts and corpuscles, and a complete content of the biological particles in the flowing water and its permittivity are missing.

"Medicinal plants have been used traditionally to cure a variety of diseases since ancient times. Elsholtzia densa, a rare annual herb of the Kashmir valley, was assessed for its antioxidant efficacy. Antioxidant activity of the crude extracts was evaluated using 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radical (DPPH), DNA sugar damage, lipid peroxidation, ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays. The maximum percentage decrease of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH) standard solution was recorded for the 50% ethanolic extract (90.48%). The extracts were further evaluated using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. The methanolic extract showed the highest activity (32.02%) in reducing oxidative damage to DNA. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was also determined using the linoleic acid system and the highest antioxidant activity (49.64%) was found in the 50% ethanolic extract. In the case of the FTC assay, the 50% ethanolic extract showed the highest activity (70.14%) which was comparable to that of α-tocopherol. Moreover, total phenolics concentration was found to be 62.5 mg% and 77.5 mg% in the cases of absolute ethanolic and 50% ethanolic extracts, respectively. These findings indicate promising antioxidant activity of crude extracts of the plant and the need for further exploration of their effective use in both modern and traditional systems of medicine.

"We have reported that electrical acupuncture stimulation (ACU) increases blood fluidity by decreasing platelet aggregation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism causing the increase of blood fluidity. The effects of ACU on blood fluidity and platelet adhesion were examined using a Micro Channel Array Flow Analyzer (MC-FAN) and a laser scattering platelet aggregometer (PA-20). Male Wistar rats (7–8 weeks old) were used in the study. ACU (1 or 100 Hz, 3–5 V), which causes slight muscle twitching, was applied to the ZuSanli (ST-36) acupoint for 15 or 60 minutes once/day. Blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava. ACU applied to ST-36 revealed significant increases in blood fluidity, while platelet adhesion activity decreased, regardless of the difference of stimulus time. The acupuncture had an immediate effect. Even if naloxone was administered during acupuncture stimulus, the blood flow time shortened in a similar way, as in the only acupuncture stimulus group. In addition, the effect of acupuncture on blood fluidity was inhibited by a β-antagonist. The results indicate that ACU affects blood fluidity depending on the acupoints, and that the effect of ACU might involve an endogenous adrenergic mechanism. "
"The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of moxibustion (MOX) treatment at the GV4 and CV12 acupoints, and to determine the correlations between MOX treatment and interleukin (IL)-6 and corticosterone levels in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. CIA mice were immunized twice intradermally over a 3-week interval with bovine type II collagen. After the second immunization (day 21), MOX was applied to the mouse equivalent of the GV4 and CV12 acupoints with a 1 mg moxa cone five times/day. Clinical symptoms of CIA were observed three times/week until day 35. The concentrations of IL-6 and corticosterone in the blood samples were measured by immunoassay kits. At day 35, the incidence of CIA was significantly decreased in mice treated with MOX at the GV4 acupoint (78%, n = 23, p < 0.05), compared to untreated CIA mice (100%) and mice treated with MOX at the CV12 acupoint (100%). IL-6 and corticosterone levels were significantly increased by immunization. IL-6 levels significantly decreased in mice treated with MOX at the GV4 acupoint. These results suggest that MOX treatment suppressed CIA at the GV4 acupoint, not at the CV12 acupoint, possibly through inhibition of IL-6 production. n p n p "
"Objectives To study the effect of acupuncture on heart rate variability (HRV) by using linear and non-linear methods of analysis. Methods 40 patients were recruited consecutively, including patients with insomnia, stomachache, diarrhea, dizziness, cervical syndrome, lower back pain, gonarthritis, peripheral facial paralysis, post-traumatic organic brain syndrome and urinary retention. Different acupoint prescriptions were used, according to the textbook for 5-years' education on traditional Chinese medicine specialty, which is used in Chinese Universities. HRV was recorded before, during, and after acupuncture. Results Acupuncture substantially reduced variability, causing a 41% reduction in the standard deviation. Using a Fourier analysis, the variances both in the low frequency (LF) and the high frequency (HF) ranges were markedly reduced, but the LF/HF ratio (an indication of sympatho-vagal balance) was not altered. The HR was unchanged. The sample entropy, which is a measure of the complexity of time series, was significantly increased (+35%). Conclusions Acupuncture produced a pattern of changes different from that seen in pathological conditions, where increased variability and reduced complexity is expected. "
"Background Patients with end-stage liver diseases who undergo liver transplantation may suffer from hypotension related to the liver disease itself or related to the surgical procedure. Because electro-acupuncture (EA) at the Neiguan (PC-6) and the Jianshi (PC-5) points influences hemodynamics, we hypothesize that electro-acupuncture at the traditionally used acupuncture points will reduce the severity of hypotension in patients who undergo liver transplantation. Methods Forty patients with end-stage liver disease who underwent orthotropic deceased donor liver transplantation were randomized into two groups. The norepinephrine (NE) group received norepinephrine as a vasoconstrictor, and the electro-acupuncture group received EA at the PC-5 and the PC-6 points for treatment of hypotension during anesthesia for the liver transplantation. The patients were monitored, during the three stages of liver transplantation by using hemodynamic parameters. Results During the three stages of liver transplantation, there were no significant differences in the hemodynamic measurements including the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and central venous pressure between the two groups (p > 0.05). p p Conclusions Electro-acupuncture at the acupuncture points reduced the severity and the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia for liver transplantation.

"Objectives This study was designed to evaluate the effect of traditional Korean medical therapy, consisting of needle-embedding therapy and pharmacopuncture therapy, on patients with urinary incontinence. Methods Twenty-nine patients with urinary incontinence underwent two sessions of traditional Korean medical therapy in a month. The pressure and the duration of pelvic muscle contraction were measured and compared. The primary endpoint of the study was improvement in the strength of pelvic floor muscle contraction. The paired t-test was used for the statistical analysis. Results Before treatment, a maximum pressure of 16.03 ± 6.28 mmHg and an average pressure of 9.62 ± 4.98 mmHg were measured, and the duration was 11.82 ± 12.08 seconds. After the first treatment, the pressures were 27.41 ± 10.46 mmHg (maximum) and 18.62 ± 9.72 mmHg (average), and the duration was 40.75 ± 60.02 seconds. After the second treatment, the pressures were 29 ± 14.86 mmHg (maximum) and 20.31 ± 11.51 mmHg (average), and the duration was 34.62 ± 42.02 seconds. Comparisons between before treatment and first treatment results and between before treatment and second treatment results showed statistically significant changes but the difference between the first treatment result and the second treatment result was not statistically significant. Conclusions Patients receiving traditional Korean medical therapy showed improved pelvic muscle contraction ability after a single treatment. If strength of pelvic floor muscle contraction is improved, symptoms of urinary incontinence also get better. Traditional Korean medical therapy, with a focus on needle-embedding therapy and pharmacopuncture therapy, may be effective for treating urinary incontinence. "
"This study investigated the effect of ethanol extracts of Ganoderma lucidum (EGL) on the correlation between tightening of the tight junctions (TJs) and the anti-invasive activity in human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells to elucidate further the possible anticancer mechanisms that G lucidum exerts. Within the concentrations of EGL that were not cytotoxic, EGL markedly inhibited the cell motility and invasiveness in a concentration-dependent manner. The activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in AGS cells were dose-dependently inhibited by treatment with EGL, and this was correlated with a decrease in expression of their mRNA and proteins and the upregulation of the expression of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The anti-invasive activity of EGL was also found to be associated with the increased tightness of the TJ, which was demonstrated by an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance. Additionally, EGL repressed the levels of the claudin family members, which are major components of TJs that play a key role in the control and selectivity of paracellular transport. Furthermore, the levels of E-cadherin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, were inhibited by EGL treatment, however, those of snail, an epithelial to mesenchymal transition regulator and zinc finger transcription factor, were concentration-dependently increased in response to EGL treatment. Although further studies are needed, the present study indicates that TJs and MMPs are crucial targets of EGL-induced anti-invasiveness in human gastric cancer AGS cells.

"Manual acupuncture at Yanglingquan (GB34) is reported to have a beneficial effect on chronic liver damage. We, therefore, studied the effect of manual acupuncture at GB34 on acute liver damage. Rats were administered carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or olive oil, and direct manual acupuncture was subsequently performed at GB34 or at a sham point (a nonacupoint). In rats administered with CCl4, the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, the total cholesterol concentration, and the levels of hepatic thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances were suppressed by acupuncture at GB34 when compared with acupuncture at the sham point. By contrast, there was little histological difference in the liver between acupuncture at GB34 and that at the sham point in rats administered with CCl4. These results suggest that manual acupuncture at GB34 tends to improve acute liver damage but is not sufficient by itself to completely resolve the hepatic injury. 4 4 4 4 4 4 "
"Myrtus communis L. aerial parts have been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory disease. In this study 350 mice were divided into three main groups: negative (saline), positive (morphine or diclofenac) controls, and test groups. The acute toxicity was assessed for 2 days. Antinociceptive activity was performed using hot plate and writhing tests. The anti-inflammatory effect was investigated using xylene-induced ear edema and a cotton pellet test. According to phytochemical screening, the extracts contained tannins, alkaloids, and flavonoids. The LD50 values of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts were 0.473 and 0.79 g/kg, respectively. In hot plate test, the aqueous and ethanolic extracts showed significant antinociceptive activity that was inhibited by naloxone. The extracts exhibited antinociceptive activity against acetic acid–induced writhing and also showed significant activity against acute inflammation which was dose dependent for aqueous extract. The ethanolic (0.05 g/kg) and aqueous extracts (0.005, 0.015, and 0.03 g/kg) demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects against chronic inflammation. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts of M communis L. showed antinociceptive effects and these may be mediated by opioid receptors.

"The present study aims to determine the in vitro antiproliferative and antioxidant activities of various extracts from the leaves of Melastoma malabathricum using various established in vitro assays. The aqueous extract inhibited the proliferation of Caov-3 and HL-60 cell lines, while the chloroform extract exhibited antiproliferative activity against the Caov-3, HL-60, and CEM-SS cell lines. The methanol extract demonstrated antiproliferative activity against more cell lines, including the MCF-7, HeLa, Caov-3, HL-60, CEM-SS, and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines. Interestingly, all extracts did not inhibit the proliferation of 3T3 cells, thus indicating their noncytotoxic properties. Unlike the chloroform extracts, the aqueous and methanol extracts of M malabathricum (20, 100, and 500 μg/ml) produced high antioxidant activity for the superoxide scavenging assay with only the 500 μg/ml aqueous and methanol extracts exhibited high activity for the 2,2-diphenyl -1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay.

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a serious obesity-related disorder, and it will continue to be a major liver health issue worldwide in the coming decades. We aimed to determine the effect of Liv-Pro-08 (Nigella sativa, Entada pursaetha, and Ficus glomerata) an oral ayurvedic formulation on rats fed with high-fat diet. Rats were given a high-fat diet for a period of 7 days. After this period, Liv-Pro-08 (250, 500, and 750 mg/kg.body weight was given orally for 7 days. We examined the effect of the high-fat diet on various parameters related to obesity and insulin resistance. In the experimental rats who received the extract of Liv-Pro-08, their lipoprotein profiles were significantly improved compared with those that are not receiving the extract. Also, a slight reduction was observed in serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase enzymes. Moreover, Liv-Pro-08 significantly decreased their fasting serum glucose and fasting insulin levels. This experimental study suggests that Liv-Pro-08 can act as a therapeutic tool in preventing NAFLD progression (i.e., reducing hepatic lipid accumulation). Although further investigations and large randomized trials should be conducted, ayurvedic Liv-Pro-08 oral formulation may be a potential natural drug for NAFLD in the future.

"We investigated the effects of violet laser acupuncture on arterial stiffness and other important parameters of the functional state of the heart such as augmentation index (AIx). This investigation ties together the medical perspectives of Eastern and Western medical practitioners; the Western medical perspective of the functional states of the human heart including systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and the Eastern medical perspective regarding taking patients’ pulses for diagnosis and using acupuncture for subsequent treatments. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a direct marker of arterial stiffness; AIx indicates wave reflection. Both parameters can be measured by cuff applied to the brachial artery. The first results from a pilot study of 10 healthy volunteers (M/F, 3/7; mean age ± SD, 27.8 ± 6.8 years) regarding violet laser acupuncture (405 nm; 110 mW; 500 μm; 10 min) showed a marked but not statistically significant decrease in aortic PWV and an increase in brachial AIx during and after laser acupuncture at the acupoint Baihui.

"Murine melanoma requires the complex development of lymphatic, vascular, and non-vascular structures. A possible relationship between the primo vascular system (PVS) and the melanoma metastasis has been proposed. In particular, the PVS may be involved in oxygen transport. Vasculogenic-like networks, similar to the PVS, have been found within melanoma tumors, but their functional relationship with the PVS and meridian structures are unclear. Herein, we report on the use of an electrochemical O2 sensor to study oxygenation levels of melanoma tumors in mice. We consistently found higher tissue oxygenation in specific sites of tumors (n = 5). These sites were strongly associated with vascular structures or the PVS. Furthermore, the PVS on the tumor surface was associated with adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that the PVS is involved in the regulation of metastasis. 2 n 2 n "

Significant (p < 0.001) increases of temperature at a region of interest around the acupoint were observed. Furthermore, temperature also increased significantly (p < 0.05) at a so-called “far field” area Zhiyang (GV9). In two persons, however, needle acupuncture and placebo (deactivated laser) did not have the same temperature effects. Violet laser induces changes in skin surface temperature distributions. p p p p "
"A great number of reflexologies use ancient concepts that do not coincide with modern medical terminology of anatomy, physiology, and biophysics, substantially reducing the trust of today’s physicians in this direction of their profession. Recently, several mathematical models of internal and biological active points of meridian structures interaction have been proposed. These models allowed specification of diseases for which reflex diagnostics and reflex therapy methods are most effective and also increased the efficacy of these procedures. Good results for the prediction and early diagnosis of diseases from the reaction energy of biologically active points (acupuncture points) are obtained using fuzzy logic decision making. "
"Although it was believed that the brain was incapable of regeneration after embryonic development, neurogenesis is now known to occur into adulthood. Adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Acupuncture has long been used to treat neurologic conditions, and recent reports suggest that neurogenesis may account for its beneficial effects. ST36 was the most often used acupoint in previous reports and was shown to enhance cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. This acupoint may be linked to the brain through the primo vascular system, an anatomic structure thought to correspond to acupuncture meridians. This primitive vascular-like system appears to be involved in physiologic and pathologic processes by circulating substances throughout the body. The role of the primo vascular system as the link between the skin and brain underlying the beneficial effects of acupuncture requires further investigation. "
"Type 2 diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the world. The main aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of combined therapy using acupressure therapy, hypnotherapy, and transcendental meditation (TM) on the blood sugar (BS) level in comparison with placebo in type 2 diabetic patients. We used “convenience sampling” for selection of patients with type 2 diabetes; 20 patients were recruited. For collection of data, we used an identical quasi-experimental design called “nonequivalent control group.” Therapy sessions each lasting 60–90 min were carried out on 10 successive days. We prescribed 2 capsules (containing 3 g of wheat flour each) for each member of the placebo group (one for evening and one for morning). Pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up tests were conducted in a medical laboratory recognized by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran. Mean BS level in the post-tests and follow-up tests for the experimental group was reduced significantly in comparison with the pre-tests whereas in the placebo group no changes were observed. Combined therapy including acupressure therapy, hypnotherapy, and TM reduced BS of type 2 diabetic patients and was more effective than placebo therapy on this parameter. "
"The comet assay is a standard method for measuring DNA damage. In this study, the protective effects of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Portulaca oleracea L. (P. oleracea) on human lymphocyte DNA lesions were evaluated with the comet assay. Lymphocytes were isolated from blood samples taken from healthy volunteers. Human lymphocytes were incubated in H2O2 (50,100, and 200 μM), aqueous extract (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg/ml), and ethanolic extracts (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg/ml) of P. oleraceae aerial parts alone with a combination of H2O2 (100 μM) with either 1 or 2.5 mg/ml of both extracts at 4°C for 30 minutes. The extent of DNA migration was measured using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis approach assay, and DNA damage was expressed as percentage tail DNA. We found that the aqueous extract of P. oleracea significantly inhibited DNA damage, while there was no effect of the ethanolic extract. These data suggest that the aqueous extract of P. oleracea can prevent oxidative DNA damage to human lymphocytes, which is likely due to antioxidant constituents in the extract.

"Abstract Herbal remedies have become popular, due in part to the lower risk of adverse reactions. Thousands of plants have been used traditionally to treat various diseases. Among them, species of the genus Piper are important medicinal plants used in various systems of medicine. The Piper longum fruit has been used in traditional medicine, including the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Although there are numerous indications for its use, controlled trials are needed to determine its efficacy. The primary constituents isolated from various parts of P. longum are piperine, piperlongumine, sylvatin, sesamin, diaeudesmin piperlonguminine, pipermonaline, and piperundecalidine. It is most commonly used to treat chronic bronchitis, asthma, constipation, gonorrhea, paralysis of the tongue, diarrhea, cholera, chronic malaria, viral hepatitis, respiratory infections, stomachache, bronchitis, diseases of the spleen, cough, and tumors. This study provides detailed information about the P. longum fruit, including phytochemistry, pharmacological profile and safety profile. In view of the commercial, economic, and medicinal importance of the P. longum plant, it is useful for researchers to study the plant in detail.

"Abstract This study aimed to compare the effects of high frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and low-frequency EA on the autonomic nervous system by using a heart rate variability measuring device in normal individuals. Fourteen participants were recruited and each participated in the high-frequency and low-frequency sessions (crossover design). The order of sessions was randomized and the interval between the two sessions was over 2 weeks. Participants received needle insertion with 120-Hz stimulation during the high-frequency session (high-frequency EA group), and with 2-Hz stimulation during the low-frequency session (low-frequency EA group). Acupuncture needles were directly inserted perpendicularly to LI 4 and LI 11 acupoints followed by delivery of electric pulses to these points for 15 minutes. Heart rate variability was measured 5 minutes before and after EA stimulation by a heart rate variability measuring system. We found a significant increase in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval in the high-frequency EA group, with no change in the low-frequency EA group. Both the high-frequency and low-frequency EA groups showed no significant differences in other parameters including high-frequency power, low-frequency power, and the ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power. Based on these findings, we concluded that high-frequency EA stimulation is more effective than low-frequency EA stimulation in increasing autonomic nervous activity and there is no difference between the two EA frequencies in enhancing sympathovagal balance.

"Abstract The primo-vascular system was visualized in the mesentery surrounding the small intestine of a dog using Trypan blue. This structure, which was first observed in a rat, formed a network as primo-vessel branches were joined to primo-nodes. Other characteristic features of the primo-vascular system, such as bundles of tubes with fibrous extracellular matrix in a primo-vessel and a broken-line alignment of rod-shaped nuclei along the primo-vessel, were observed. Blood vessels, lymph vessels, and primo-vessels were present in the same mesentery, and they could clearly be distinguished by histological differences. "
"Abstract This systematic review aims to evaluate the available evidence from randomized clinical trials of the clinical efficacy and safety of ginseng. Systematic literature searches were performed in 13 databases up to March 2009 without language restriction. All randomized clinical trials evaluating the clinical effects or safety of the use of ginseng monopreparations (Panax ginseng or P. quinquefolium) were considered for inclusion. A total of 411 potentially relevant studies were identified and 57 randomized clinical trials were included. The main indications included glucose metabolism, physical performance, psychomotor function, sexual function, cardiac function, pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular disease. We found strong evidence of a positive effect of ginseng on glucose metabolism, psychomotor function, and pulmonary disease, whereas evidence suggests that ginseng is not effective at enhancing physical performance. However, ginseng generally has a good safety profile and the incidence of adverse effects seems to be low. In conclusion, our review compiles the evidence on the use of ginseng, finding a strong positive potential for glucose metabolism, psychomotor function, and pulmonary disease, but not for physical performance enhancement.

"Abstract The primo-vascular system is described as the anatomical structure corresponding to acupuncture meridians and has been identified in several tissues in the body, but its detailed anatomy and physiology are not well understood. Recently, the presence of keratin 10 (Krt10) in primo-vascular tissue was reported, but this finding has not yet been confirmed. In this study, we compared Krt10 expression in primo-vascular tissues located on the surface of rat abdominal organs with Krt10 expression on blood and lymphatic vessels. Krt10 protein (approximately 56.5 kDa) was evaluated by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Krt10 (IR) in the primo-node was visualized as patchy spots around each cell or as a follicle-like structure containing a group of cells. Krt10 IR was also identified in vascular and lymphatic tissues, but its distribution was diffuse over the extracellular matrix of the vessels. Thus Krt10 protein was expressed in all three tissues tested, but the expression pattern of Krt10 in primo-vascular tissue differed from those of blood and lymphatic vascular tissues, suggesting that structural and the regulatory roles of Krt10 in primo-vascular system are different from those in blood and lymphatic vessels.

"Abstract The aim of this study is to explore the correlations between fasciology and yin yang doctrine. Professor Yuan developed fasciology by three-dimensional reconstruction of connective tissue (fascia) in the trunk and limbs of the human body and tracing back to tissue origins in light of biological evolution and developmental biology. Fasciology states that the human body can be divided into two systems: the supporting-storing system and the functional system. This article elaborates on the roles of the two systems and their mutual relationship. The two systems are used to analyze the yin, the yang, and their relationship. The two systems are promoted but also restricted in different contexts. The supporting-storing system is formed by undifferentiated connective tissue and provides undifferentiated cells and nutrients for differentiated cells of the functional system. Thus, the supporting-storing system could be classified as quiet, similar to yin. The functional system continuously maintains the various functional activities of the human body. Thus, the functional system could be classified as active, similar to yang. In interpreting the yin yang doctrine from the point of view of fasciology, yin can be compared with the supporting-storing system and yang can be compared with the functional system. yin yang yin yang yin. yang. yin yang yin yang yin yang yin yang yin. yang. yin yang yin yang "
"Abstract Hot flashes are one of the main problems in postmenopausal patients. Hormone replacement therapy is the standard treatment for this vasomotor symptom, but long-term estrogen treatment can produce serious adverse effects such as higher risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. For this reason, hormone replacement therapy may not be advisable for young patients. Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan is an herbal decoction for hot flashes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We have extensive experience treating hot flashes in young women; this preliminary case series evaluates the effectiveness of Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan for alleviating hot flashes in young patients. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of outpatients who visited the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurologic Disease, Kyung Hee Oriental Medical Center for hot flashes from October 1, 2003 to October 1, 2008. Of the 60 cases, 37 met the inclusion criteria. Mean improvement in symptoms, as assessed using the visual analog scale, was 40.4±28.5%; 51.3% of patients experienced a 50% improvement. According to the secondary analysis, the results of differential diagnosis of cold and hot syndrome and blood stasis syndrome did not affect scores. Only 2.7% of the patients reported adverse events. Our findings suggest that Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan improves hot flashes in young patients in a relatively safe manner. However, rigorous clinical studies are needed to confirm these results. "
"Abstract The study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-spermatogenic efficacy of ethanol extract of stem bark of Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. For the in vitro study, semen samples were obtained from 15 healthy fertile men aged 25–35 years. Sperm motility was examined by the Sander-Cramer method. A dose-dependent and time-dependent effect of ethanol extract on sperm motility and sperm viability were observed. Various concentrations affected the motility of sperm. Ethanol extract at a concentration of 20 mg/mL caused complete immobilization within 3 minutes. Sperm viability and hypo-osmotic swelling was significantly reduced at this concentration. The in vivo studies were carried out on Swiss male albino mice. Ethanol extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight resulted in a significant decrease (p<0.001) in weight of the testis and epididymis. A significant decrease (p<0.01) in sperm motility and sperm count in the epididymis were observed. Histological changes in the epididymis and testis were also investigated.

"Abstract Laser Doppler flowmetry for microcirculation monitoring was performed in 10 healthy volunteers (mean age ± SD: 24.9 ± 3.3 years; 5 females, 5 males) prior to, during, and after stimulation using a noninvasive violet (405 nm) laser needle at the Dazhui (GV14) acupoint. The results of this controlled study (control point at the shoulder) showed significant (p < 0.05) increases in Flux (product of concentration and velocity of erythrocytes) at a distance of 3 cm from the acupoint. At the same time, no changes were found at the control point. Furthermore, 5 minutes after stimulation the microcirculation still flowed at a higher level than baseline values at the beginning of the investigation. In a single individual it was demonstrated that needle acupuncture enhanced this effect and placebo (deactivated laser) did not have a significant effect. The results suggest that violet laser acupuncture at the acupoint Dazhui can increase vascular effects on microcirculation. p p "
"Abstract The aim of the study was to define the toxicity of HangAmDan-B (HAD-B) in mice over the short and long term. HAD-B was studied in 1-week single and 5-week repeated oral dose toxicity tests on male Imprinting Control Region mice. Doses used in 1 week single oral dose toxicity tests were 0, 0.2, 1, 5, and 25 g/kg/day and those of repeated toxicity test were 0, 0.04, 0.2, 1, and 2 g/kg/day. Blood and urine samples were assayed and their morphology observed. Numerical data were compared using Mann-Whitney U test and analysis of variance. Significantly decreased red blood cell levels in mice from S2-HAD-B, S3-HAD-B, S4-HAD-B, and S5-HAD-B groups were observed in single oral dose toxicity tests. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean cell hemoglobin values in mice from the S4-HAD-B and S5-HAD-B groups were also significantly decreased. No mortalities or significant differences in all factors were observed during the dosing period of the repeated dose toxicity test. Administering 2 g/kg/day of HAD-B in mice over a 5-week period showed no significant hematological changes. However, risk of anemia with more than 5 g/kg/ day administration of HAD-B was found. In general, HAD-B appears to be safe and nontoxic, and a no observed adverse effect level in mice was established at 2 g/kg/ day. This data serves as satisfactory preclinical evidence for the safety of HAD-B should a future clinical trial for HAD-B be launched. Further studies are required to confirm these safety results and to carry out a safety trial in humans. "
"Abstract The clinical practice of recording skin conductance (SC) at acupuncture points (acupoints), as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic monitoring aid may have scientific merit. However, influences of age, gender and time of day on these recordings are unknown and it is unclear whether SC at acupoints differs from SC levels in general (as reported in psychophysiology research). This paper summarizes SC data obtained with the AcuGraph 3 Digital Meridian Imaging System between June 2005 and March 31, 2010. An initial dataset of 117,725 SC examinations was scrubbed to include only the first SC examination on individual patients and exclude potentially faulty data. The final dataset consists of SC recordings at the 24 Source (Yuan) acupoints in 8637 patients, collected by 311 practitioners. Twelve left/right average conductance measures and an overall average of the 24 acupoints were assessed. Statistical analyses included two sample t tests, three way analyses of variance and linear regression. Results indicate that mean SC at acupoints, similar to SC in general, is higher in males, higher in afternoons and declines with age. Not previously reported, the rate of SC decline with age differs at different acupoints between males and females. These findings have substantial implications for acupuncture research and practice. t t "
"Abstract Traditional acupuncture (TA) and ear acupuncture (EA) are used for treatment of headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain. The purpose of this study is to develop effective treatment using combined acupuncture (CA) which consists of TA and EA and to set clinical protocols for future trials. Participants were divided into TA (n = 15) control and CA (n = 34) experimental groups. Obligatory points among Korean Five Element Acupuncture and optional individual points along with symptom points were used in the TA group. The CA group was exposed to ear points of Fossion and TA. Acupuncture treatment consisted of six mandatory sessions per patient over 3 weeks and extended to 12 sessions. Pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale. We compared TA to CA and researched their relevant publications. No significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.968) which showed pain-alleviating tendency. Pain alleviation was significantly different after the fifth and sixth sessions (p = 0.021, p = 0.025), with headache being the most significantly relieved (F = 4.399, p = 0.018) among the diseases. When assessing pain intensity, both the Headache Impact Test and the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale should be adopted for headache and the fractal electroencephalography method be used in pain diseases. In the future, studies should consist of TA, EA, and CA groups; each group having 20 patients. Treatment number should to be no less than 10 sessions. Korean Five Element Acupuncture should be a compulsory inclusion along with individual points being optional inclusion in TA. EA could be selected from Nogier, Fossion and so forth. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment, whether TA or CA, showed pain alleviation in headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain, but no significant difference was seen between groups. Prospective, well-controlled, and relevant protocols using multimodal strategies to define the role of TA, EA, and CA are needed. n n p p p F p n n p p p F p "
"Abstract Stress applied to rats is known to result in a quick decrease in blood fluidity. Although electrical acupuncture stimulation (ACU) attenuates stress responses, the influence of ACU on blood fluidity has not been well examined. In the present study, the effect of ACU on blood fluidity and platelet adhesion was examined using a Micro Channel Array Flow Analyzer and a laser scattering platelet aggregometer (PA-20), respectively. Male Wistar rats (7-8 weeks old) were used. ACU (1 Hz, 3-5 V), which causes slight muscle twitching, was applied to acupoints for 60 minutes/day once or on 2 consecutive days. Stimulated acupoints were as follows: ZuSanli (ST-36), Sanyinjiao (SP-6), Hegu (L-I4), Neiguan (P-6), and Shenshu (BL-23). ACU applied to ST-36, SP-6, and L-14 revealed significant increases in blood fluidity while platelet adhesion activity decreased. No significant changes were observed when ACU was applied to P-6 and BL-23. Results indicate that ACU affects blood fluidity depending on the acupoints. Blood fluidity changed with ACU within 1 day. In other words, the effect of acupuncture has an immediate effect. In addition, platelet aggregation decreased with ACU, suggesting that an increase in blood fluidity is associated with platelet aggregation ability. "
"Abstract This study aims to observe the efficacy of mountain Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) pharmacopuncture (MGP) on cancer patients using different delivery methods of acupoint injection and intravenous infusion. Six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who met the eligibility criteria were observed. Two patients were continuously infused with MGP (20 mL/day) intravenously, and the other two patients were injected with MGP (10 mL/day) on acupoint LU1 bi-lateral continuously. The remaining two patients received MGP therapy using both methods of delivery. Results were followed by computed tomography (CT) after every cycle; each cycle lasted for 28 days. Two patients infused intravenously showed stable disease and two patients injected on LU1 showed progressive disease. Two patients treated using both methods showed stable disease during the intravenous infusion period and progressive disease during the intraacupuncture injection period. One patient showed progressive disease in the latest chest CT in spite of receiving MGP intravenous infusion. We suggested that MGP may be more effective when used as an intravenous infusion rather than acupoint injection in NSCLC patients. Panax ginseng Panax ginseng "
"Abstract Several systematic reviews (SRs) have assessed the effectiveness of cupping for a range of conditions. Our aim was to provide a critical evaluation and summary of these data. Electronic searches were conducted to locate all SRs concerning cupping for any condition. Data were extracted by two authors according to predefined criteria. Five SRs met our inclusion criteria, which related to the following conditions: pain conditions, stroke rehabilitation, hypertension, and herpes zoster. The numbers of studies included in each SR were small. Relatively clear evidence emerged only for one indication, that cupping may be effective for reducing pain. Based on evidence from the currently available SRs, the effectiveness of cupping has been demonstrated only as a treatment for pain, and even for this indication doubts remain. "
"Abstract Electrodermal activity (EDA) at acupuncture points (acupoints) has been investigated for its utility as a diagnostic aid, a therapeutic monitoring tool, and a physiological outcome measure. The research methodologies reported in published trials, however, vary considerably and publications often lack sufficient details about electrical instrumentation, technical procedures, laboratory conditions, recorded measures, and control comparisons to permit a critical appraisal of the studies or to replicate promising findings. We developed a 10-category (54 subitems) Quality of Reporting scale based on technical issues associated with EDA measurements, publication requirements for reporting EDA in the psychophysiological literature, and recommendations from the CONSORT Statement for reporting clinical trials. Using our Quality of Reporting scale, we extracted data from 29 studies that evaluated EDA at acupoints in patients and generated weighted scores for each of the 10 categories of essential information. Only 9 of the 29 studies reviewed scored a mean of greater than 50% for reporting details of essential information. To rigorously build a program of research on EDA at acupoints we need to standardize research methodology and reporting protocols. We propose a checklist of recommended informational items to report in future clinical trials that record EDA at acupoints. "

"Abstract This study aimed to retrospectively examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the relief of pain originating from temporomandibular joint disorder and trigeminal neuralgia. Participants included patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia or temporomandibular disorder with osseous pathology ruled out by panoramic X-rays. Participants received a series of 8–10 weekly acupuncture treatments and rated their pain via a visual analogue scale. From assessment of a total of 39 patients, analysis of pain severity before and after treatment showed that acupuncture intervention was highly beneficial for patients with temporomandibular joint disorder (88.6%, p < 0.01), compared with patients with trigeminal neuralgia in which there was only a minor effect (25%). The data also demonstrated that acupuncture was both efficacious in acute patients (91%, p < 0.01) and chronic patients (70%, p < 0.05) and elicited no side effects during the course of treatment. Acupuncture treatment was a safe and efficient methodology for relieving the pain of patients suffering from temporomandibular disorder with no detectable osseous joint component. Based on these results, a randomized clinical trial is being initiated at the Stomatologic Clinic at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center to assess the role of acupuncture in treating temporomandibular joint disorder. p p p p p p "
"Abstract Nasturtium officinale R. Br. (watercress), of the family Brassicaceae, has been long used as a home remedy or a medicinal plant by the people of southeastern Iran. The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant activity of N. officinale extract using various in vitro assay systems, including the ferric reducing antioxidant power and 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) assays, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide radical scavenging, and ferrous ion chelating activity, as well as the inhibitory effect on ferrous ion/ascorbate induced lipid peroxidation, in rat liver homogenate. The results revealed that N. officinale extract possesses potent reducing power in a ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, concentration-dependent scavenging ability on 2,2′-azinobis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, nitric oxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide, as well as chelating ability on ferrous ions. Furthermore, N. officinale extract prevented thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation in ferrous ion/ascorbate induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, this N. officinale extract had the phenolic and flavonoid contents of 96.2 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dried extract and 63.2 mg catechin equivalents/g dried extract, respectively. The cumulative results clearly indicate that N. officinale extract possesses potent antioxidant properties probably mediated through direct trapping of free radicals, reducing power, and also through metal chelating. Based on its antioxidative potential, N. officinale extract might find applications in the prevention of free radical-related diseases.

"Abstract Violet laser acupuncture using a wavelength of 405 nm has been investigated in only a few scientific studies. The aim of this study was to provide selective evidence of a specific effect of violet laser acupuncture on mean cerebral blood flow velocity using a Doppler ultrasound technique. A transcranial Doppler sonography construction was developed especially for this study to monitor blood flow profiles in the basilar and middle cerebral arteries simultaneously and continuously. The acupuncture point Dazhui on the upper back was tested in a controlled study with 10 healthy volunteers (24.9 ± 3.3 years, mean age ± SD; 5 females, 5 males). In addition to an on/off-effect, violet laser stimulation increased the blood flow velocity in the basilar artery significantly (p < 0.001) compared with the reference interval before laser acupuncture. In the middle cerebral artery, only minimal, nonsignificant changes in blood flow velocity were seen. Metal needle acupuncture at the same point intensified the effects; however, blood flow profiles did not change significantly during and after stimulation with a deactivated violet laser. p p "
"Abstract The human body has a symmetric structure and maintains a physiological balance through the harmony of yin and yang. One of the fundamental principles of acupuncture is that unbalanced or abnormal bioenergetic conditions on the left and right meridians may be restored to a balanced, normal condition by acupuncture therapy. In this study, the electrical potential along the stomach meridian was measured to investigate the bioenergy consensus between the operator and subject during acupuncture stimulation, and the acupuncture response on opposite meridians was investigated by comparing the electric potential on the left and right stomach meridian during stimulation of the left side stomach meridian-36. When meridian electrical potential was simultaneously measured in both the operator and subject, opposite polarities were observed, which might indicate the transfer of bioenergy between operator and subject. In addition, the meridian electrical potentials of the subjects' left and right stomach meridians were also always of opposite polarity and presented three different signal patterns, which might have represented the condition of the associated meridian. yin yang. yin yang.

"Abstract The relationship between connective tissue and meridian function is discussed in terms of energy transmission. The network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules interspersed within the collagen fibrillar matrix is especially significant for both the sensitivity of connective tissue to weak signals of mechanical pressure, heat, or electricity and the electrical intercommunication that may correlate with the meridian acupuncture system. Special electromagnetic properties of connective tissue have similar collective properties of ultraweak photon emission. A relationship between ultraweak photon emission and yin yang dynamics is based on three types of ultraweak photon emission studies, focusing on diurnal and annual dynamics, diseased states, and acupuncture points. A novel concept explains the functional (health) integrity of physiologic systems in relation to the left-right balance in ultraweak photon emission by pointing to, (1) balanced corticoneuromusculoskeletal activities and triboluminescent aspects of ultraweak photon emission by skeletal structures, and (2) local fine-tuning in oxygen supply and the formation of radical oxygen species. This approach offers testable hypotheses for further validation utilizing a combination of human photon recording techniques and specialized metabolomics for the estimation of organ-specific oxidative states. yin yang yin yang "
"Abstract The mode by which Loranthus ferrugineus methanol extract antagonizes and/or modulates norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was investigated in rat aortic rings. The vascular effects of three different concentrations of this extract were challenged against cumulative additions of norepinephrine. Phentolamine, a nonselective α-adrenoceptor antagonist, verapamil, an L-type calcium channel blocker, and papaverine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were used in three different concentrations as positive controls. Log concentration-response curves and double-reciprocal plots were constructed for the extract and each vasorelaxant. To characterize antagonism reversibility, the norepinephrine maximum contractile effect was examined before extract addition to the aortic ring chamber and after its removal. Phentolamine shifted the norepinephrine log concentration-response curve to the right with no significant depression in the maximum response. Similar to verapamil and papaverine, the extract produced a rightward shift in norepinephrine log concentration-response curve and a significant drop in maximum response. The double-reciprocal plots showed comparable y-intercept values for all phentolamine concentrations, a characteristic of competitive antagonism. In contrast, different y-intercept values on double-reciprocal plots were obtained for each concentration of extract, verapamil, and papaverine, typical of noncompetitive antagonism. The norepinephrine maximum contractile response was approximately similar before the addition of extract and after its removal. The data collectively showed that L. ferrugineus methanol extract exerted its vascular effect by reversible noncompetitive antagonism of norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. These findings add to the understanding of the cardiovascular mechanisms by which L. ferrugineus, a plant traditionally used for the management of hypertension, elicits its action.

"Abstract A methanol extract of dried leaves of Melanthera scandens was examined for antioxidant activities using a variety of assays, including 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, reducing power, ferrous chelating, and ferric thiocyanate methods with ascorbic acid and EDTA as positive controls. The extract showed noticeable activities in most of these in vitro tests. The amount of phenolic compounds in the extract expressed in gallic acid equivalent was found to be 52.8 mg/g. The extract demonstrated inhibition of linoleic acid lipid peroxidation, active reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activities which were less than that of the positive controls. The extract also showed weaker iron chelating effect when compared with the EDTA positive control. The present results showed that M. scandens leaf extract possessed antioxidant properties and this plant is a potential useful source of natural antioxidants.

"Abstract Primo-vessels have been observed in the rat abdominal cavity as floating thread like structures on and not adhering to fascia-wrapped internal organs. To date their presence, locations, and lengths have been irregular and unpredictable, and their identification not regularly repeatable, thus they have remained a nagging enigma in primo-vascular system research for several years. In this work, locations were found where primo-vessels were regularly present and observed repeatedly. These vessels were not floating or freely movable but lay in a regular position in the mesentery in the abdominal cavity of the rat, being observed between the cecum and small intestine and between the colon and mesentery root. The difference between a lymph vessel and a primo-vessel is described in anatomical and histological aspects. In addition, trypan blue was found to enter primo-vessels through the surrounding membranes and filled spaces between fibers comprising the primo-vessels. It is conjectured that the previously observed floating primo-vessels had anomalously and irregularly emerged, for some unknown physiological reasons, from primo-vessels normally located in the fascia-like mesentery.

In this study, a slice preparation for primo-nodes was developed to facilitate study of the cellular properties of primo-node cells in vitro. Slices (4–8 slices; 200 μm thick) were sectioned from single primo-nodes collected from the abdominal organ surface of rats and incubated in oxygenated Krebs solution at 25°C or 31°C for up to 7 hours. Trypan blue staining and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to estimate the viability of cells in the slices. Viability was largely maintained during the first 3 hours, but subsequently decreased (from 80% to 21%, p < 0.001). In addition, the viability of slices incubated at 31°C was higher than those incubated at 25°C (80% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, high resistance seals readily formed and primo-node cells showed a mean resting membrane potential (-38 mV) comparable to that recorded with sharp electrodes and outwardly-rectifying current-voltage relationships. The results show that the primo-node slices developed in this study maintained viability for up to 4 hours in vitro. in vitro. p vs. p in vitro. in vitro. p vs. p in vitro. "
"Murdannia bracteata (C. B. Clarke) is a local plant that is widely used in Malaysia as a traditional remedy for various diseases of the kidney and liver, including inflammation and cancer. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities of M. bracteata methanol extract (MB). 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation inhibition and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of MB were determined. The hepatoprotective activity of MB was studied using a CCl4-induced liver toxicity model in rats. The hepatoprotective effect was assessed by monitoring the plasma malondialdehyde level and serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities. Histopathological changes of hepatic tissue were also investigated. The results indicated that MB possessed potential antioxidant, lipid peroxidation inhibition and free radical scavenging activities. Pretreatment of rats with MB (500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg per os) before induction of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity showed a dose-dependent reduction in the necrotic changes in hepatic tissue. The increases in plasma malondialdehyde level, serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities were also significantly inhibited by MB. The total phenolic content of MB determined using Folin-Ciocalteu assay was found to be 10%. The results of the present study indicated that the hepatoprotective effect of MB is most likely due to its antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties.

"The primo vascular system was found in the epineurium along the rat sciatic nerve following subcutaneous injection of fluorescent nanoparticles at the Zusanli acupoint (ST-36). Nanoparticles were injected into the primo-vessel near ST-36 and flowed along the sciatic nerve. Fluorescence revealed a structure in the epineurium that was hardly detectable. Images of the isolated sample stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were captured using confocal microscopy. These images showed the distinctive nuclei distribution and multi-lumen structure of primo-vessels that differentiate them from lymphatic vessels, blood capillaries and nerves. This study demonstrates a new use for nanoparticles in fluorescence reflectance imaging techniques during in vivo imaging of primo-vessels. in vivo in vivo "
"Polygala senega is extensively used in traditional systems of medicine against various lung diseases including cancer. In the present study we tested the anticancer potentials of ethanolic extract of roots of P. senega (generally used as a homeopathic drug) in a mammalian model, where mice, in vivo, were treated chronically with benzo[a] pyrene and in vitro where lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) were used. We deployed various parameters like cell viability assay, chromatin condensation studies with Hoechst 333258 staining, and maintained suitable controls. To understand the possible signal transduction pathways, expression of various signal proteins such as Aryl Hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), Bcl-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax and Caspase-3 was studied. Additionally, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of AhR, p53, PCNA and β-actin (housekeeping) genes was made. Immunohistochemical localization of PCNA proteins was also conducted in vivo. Feeding of root extract of P. senega to mice (at the rate of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg bw) chronically treated with the carcinogen (50 mg/kg bw dissolved in olive oil) showed positive modulation in expression of signal proteins. Upregulation of apoptotic signals such as p53, Caspase-3 and Bax, and downregulation of AhR, cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), Bcl-2 and PCNA were observed. Addition of root extract of Polygala Senega (at doses of 50 μg and 100 μg) into culture medium containing A549 cells induced recovery of decreased cell viability and increased chromatin fragmentation (apoptosis). Therefore, results of both in vivo and in vitro studies scientifically validate its potential use as an anticancer agent, particularly against lung cancer, and provide important information potentially helpful in drug designing.

"This experimental study was performed to investigate the antitumor effect of skin of venenum bufonis (SVB) in NCI-H460 human lung cancer cell xenografted nude mice. NCI-H460 cell lines were cultured and then xenografted into nude mice. Mice were divided into four groups: SVB (0.25 mg/kg) given orally, SVB (0.25 mg/kg) interperitoneally, SVB (0.5 mg/kg) interperitoneally, and the untreated group. Mice were raised and treated for 28 days. Body weight and tumor weight and volumes were measured daily. Absolute organ weight, microhistological observations and biochemical blood analyses were performed on the final day of the study following the sacrificing of these animals. Tumor inhibition rate, mean survival time and percent increase in life span were also calculated. Tumor size decreased in all SVB treated mice. Increasing the dose of SVB attenuated the inhibition rate seen on the 11th day of this experiment. Furthermore, tumor weight and volume in the mice treated with the highest dose of SVB were the smallest. Mice treated with high-dose intraperitoneal SVB gained weight and had significantly smaller spleens compared with untreated mice. Mean survival time and percent increase in life span in the low-dose intraperitoneal SVB treatment group were higher than those of other groups. Biochemical blood analysis revealed that phosphatase and urea nitrogen levels were decreased significantly in 0.25 mg/kg SVB orally treated mice (p < 0.01). Blood level calcium and alanine transaminase significantly decreased with intraperitoneal SVB 0.5 mg/kg (p < 0.05). The findings of this in vivo study suggest that SVB may have potential as a tumor growth inhibitor. Further research that overcomes the limitations of this study to determine the antitumor mechanism of SVB is still required. venenum bufonis p p in vivo venenum bufonis p p in vivo "
"The effect of acupuncture at the acupoints of 12 meridians on gastrointestinal and cardiac electricity in healthy adults was studied. Specific regulation between meridian points and viscera was also investigated. An electrogastrogram (EGG), electrointestinogram (EIG), carotid pulse graph, phonocardiogram and electrocardiogram were obtained in 30 healthy adults before and after acupuncture at various acupoints of 12 meridians. The effects of acupuncture on the amplitude and frequency of the EGG, EIG, pre-ejection period and the left ventricular ejection time were then analyzed. Acupuncture revealed that LR3 decreased the amplitude of the EGG while LI11 (Quchi), SJ5 (Waiguan), ST36 (Zusanli), SP9 (Yinlingquan) and SI6 (Yanglao) increased the amplitude. Multiple comparisons among the latter five acupoints indicated that there were significant differences between SP9, LI11, SJ5 and ST36 (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p < 0.05) and SI6, LI11 and SJ5 (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). SP9 effected EGG amplitude the most, followed by SI6, ST36, SJ5 and LI11. Four acupoints increased the amplitude of the EIG (p < 0.05), including HT5 (Tongli), GB34 (Yanglingquan), SP9 and SI6. No significant differences were observed between these acupoints, but SI6 showed the most obvious effect on EIG amplitude, followed by GB34, SP9 and HT5. No significant effects on the frequency of the gastrointestinal slow wave or on cardiac function indexes were observed. Effects were observed, however, on pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time. Routine acupuncture had no detrimental effects on the stomach, intestine and heart in healthy adults, but instead regulated physiological function within a normal range. These findings demonstrate the existence of specific connections between the meridian points and the viscera. The results suggest that multiple meridians control the same viscus, and the same meridian can regulate the functions of multiple viscera.

"This study aimed to review the clinical basis for Sa-Ahm Five Element acupuncture. This form of acupuncture uses the Five-Shu acupoints and the tonification-sedation treatments based on the creation and control cycles of the Five Elements. A total of 28 books and papers from the ancient “Nan-Ching” to the modern “Medical Acupuncture” were used to study clinical practices. Sa-Ahm Five Element acupuncture could be practiced in different ways depending upon differential diagnoses. These diagnoses include theories of excess and deficiency of Yin and Yang, seven emotions, ZangFu (organ, viscera), and comparing pulse diagnosis and meridian therapy to meridian palpation. Clinical trials and guidelines for the practice of Sa-Ahm acupuncture should be created to allow for a more evidence-based clinical approach to using this technique. ZangFu ZangFu "
"This paper reviews trends in research related to Korean pharmacopuncture therapy. Specifically, basic and clinical research in pharmacopuncture within the last decade is summarized by introducing categorical variables for classification. These variables are also analyzed for association. This literature review is based on articles published from February 1997 to December 2008 in a Korean journal, the Journal of the Korean Institute of Herbal Acupuncture, which was renamed the Journal of the Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute in 2007. Among the total of 379 papers published in the journal during this period, 164 papers were selected for their direct relevance to pharmacopuncture research and were categorized according to three variables: medicinal materials, acupuncture points and disease. The most frequently studied medicinal materials were bee-venom pharmacopuncture (42%), followed by meridian-field pharmacopuncture (24%), single-compound pharmacopuncture (24%), and eight-principle pharmacopuncture (10%). The frequency distributions of the acupuncture points and meridians for the injection of medicinal materials are presented. The most frequently used meridian and acupuncture point was the Bladder meridian and ST36, respectively. Contingency tables are also displayed to analyze the relationship between the categorized variables. Chi-squared analysis showed a significant association between the type of pharmacopuncture and disease. The trend in research reports on Korean pharmacopuncture therapy was reviewed and analyzed using a descriptive statistical approach to evaluate the therapeutic value of this technique for future research.

"The warm needling technique used in traditional Chinese medicine has been shown to be effective in the treatment and prevention of knee osteoarthritis (OA), but the biological mechanisms behind this action have not been well explored. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms behind warm needling using cDNA microarray technology, thus providing further scientific evidence for its efficacy. Ten patients with knee OA of deficiency-cold syndrome were selected for 2 weeks of warm needling treatment. This treatment involved stimulating the selected acupoints using needles with a burning moxa stick on their handle for 40 minutes per session. Pain intensity and accumulated clinical scores of deficiency-cold syndrome were assessed pretreatment and posttreatment using a 40-factor questionnaire of OA with deficiency-cold syndrome. Four patients with the best therapeutic efficacy were selected for cDNA microarray testing. Among the four patients, 41, 246, 57 and 70 differentially expressed genes were obtained, with more than 50% of these differentially expressed genes functionally linked to primary, cellular and energy metabolism pathways. This work demonstrates that the molecular mechanism behind warm needling treatment may be associated with the regulation of metabolism-related genes and pathways. "
"A variable heartbeat was considered a sign of good health by ancient Asian physicians. Today, new computer-based methods (e.g., “Fire of Life” analysis) allow quantification of heart rate and heart rate variability during acupuncture. The objective of this article is to compare different acupuncture methods to evaluate the influence of acupuncture on heart rhythm in short-term and long-term measurements. There were four main sections in this study: (A) a randomized controlled study using needle acupuncture and acupressure at Yintang (Ex1); (B) an innovative blue (violet) laser acupuncture randomized controlled study in Asian volunteers; (C) a comparative study using moxibustion methods; and (D) teleacupuncture. A total of 72 patients (mean age ± SD: 27.9 ± 8.6 years) were monitored over periods of 20 minutes to 24 hours in Asia and Austria. Acupuncture was performed with metal needles (in sections A, C and D) or blue laser (in section B) on Yintang, Neiguan, Guanyuan or a special acupuncture regimen for stress disorders (in sections A, B, C and D, respectively). Significant decreases in heart rate after verum intervention at Yintang, Neiguan and Guanyuan were found. Improvements in state of health following teleacupuncture were also noted. Computer-based heart rate and heart rate variability analysis was demonstrated to be effective in evaluating the status of health during acupuncture. verum verum "
"Acupuncture, one of the primary methods of treatment in traditional Oriental medicine, is based on a system of meridians. Along the meridians lie acupuncture points or acupoints, which are stimulated by needling, pressure or heat to resolve a clinical problem. A number of methods have been used to identify meridians and to explain them anatomically. Thus, tendinomuscular structures, primo-vessels (Bonghan ducts), regions of increased temperature and low skin resistance have been suggested to represent meridians or as methods to identify them. However, none of these methods have met the criteria for a meridian, an entity that, when stimulated by acupuncture can result in clinical improvement. More recently, modern physiologists have put forward the “neural hypothesis” stating that the clinical influence of acupuncture is transmitted primarily through stimulation of sensory nerves that provide signals to the brain, which processes this information and then causes clinical changes associated with treatment. Although additional research is warranted to investigate the role of some of the structures identified, it seems clear that the peripheral and central nervous system can now be considered to be the most rational basis for defining meridians. The meridian maps and associated acupoints located along them are best viewed as road maps that can guide practitioners towards applying acupuncture to achieve optimal clinical results. "
"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common chronic liver disorder, is frequently associated with the clinical features of metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance. We aimed to determine the effect of the crude and the ethyl acetate extracts of Teucrium polium on insulin resistance in rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Rats were divided into four groups. Group A was fed a normal diet for 11 weeks. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was induced in the remaining groups using a methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks. After nonalcoholic steatohepatitis development, group B continued with receiving the MCD diet alone; group C rats were given the MCD diet along with crude extract of T. polium (equivalent to 1 g leaves powder/kg body weight/day); group D rats were given the ethyl acetate fraction of T. polium by intragastric administration for 3 weeks. MCD diet led to grade 1 liver steatosis. In group C and D, these factors abated to grade 0 in 80% of the rats. In the groups receiving the extract, lipoprotein profiles were significantly improved relative to those not receiving the extract. Also, a dramatic reduction was observed in sera alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities. In addition, in groups C and D, an increase in the activities of liver superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes were also associated with a decrease in the malondialdehyde level relative to group B. Moreover, both extracts significantly decreased plasma glucose and insulin levels along with insulin resistance. In conclusion, both extracts of T. polium could reverse the adverse effects of an MCD diet. Teucrium polium T. polium T. polium T. polium Teucrium polium T. polium T. polium T. polium "
"We present the first investigation of electrical corrosion in acupuncture needles after electrical stimulation. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed the occurrence of electrochemical corrosion on the surface of stainless steel 304 acupuncture needles after electrical stimulation in the tibial muscles of rats. Biphasic pulse electrical stimuli with 10-Hz frequency, 1-mA intensity and 1-ms pulse width were applied to the needles. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method labels fragmented DNA. Positive staining using this test indicates apoptotic cells in electrically stimulated tissues. The risk of electrical corrosion was found to be less in bipolar, short-duration, low-current or voltage and short-period stimulation than in monopolar, long-duration, high-current or voltage and long-period stimulation. Evaluation with a scanning electron microscope revealed that electrical stimulation can increase the electrical corrosion of stainless steel 304 acupuncture needles. In biocompatibility studies of stainless steel 304 acupuncture needles for electrical stimulation, TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the tibial muscle within 5 days after electrical stimulation. The results of this study demonstrate that the corrosion products of stainless steel 304 acupuncture needles might affect the post-electrical stimulation tissue response. "
"Bonghan theory was proposed by Bonghan Kim to illustrate the anatomy and physiology of the acupuncture meridian system. One of his astonishing claims was the physical presence of the nerve primo-vessel, which can be involved with a regenerating system of nerves. Our previous work has shown that there is a nerve primo-vessel in brain ventricles and the central canal of the spine of a rabbit. In this study, confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and high voltage electron microscopy demonstrated that a nerve primo-vessel comprised DNA particles, other microparticles, and rod-shaped nuclei encircled by helix-shaped actins. The nerve primo-vessel had acridine orange-stained DNA particles that varied in size and were in parallel. These characteristics of the nerve primo-vessel are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of their function in the central nervous system, which may be associated with nerve regeneration. "
"Our study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We compared 42 cases treated with acupuncture with 21 cases exposed to sham acupuncture and observed the effects on nerve conduction velocity and a variety of subjective symptoms associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Three of the six measures of motor nerves, and two measures of sensory function, demonstrated significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the 15-day treatment period in the acupuncture group, while no motor or sensory function significantly improved in the sham acupuncture group. There were also significant differences in vibration perception threshold between the groups (p < 0.05) and when compared to the baseline levels (p < 0.01) in the acupuncture group. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than sham for treatment of numbness of the lower extremities, spontaneous pain in the lower extremities, rigidity in the upper extremities and alterations in temperature perception in the lower extremities after therapy. Our pilot study has, therefore, provided evidence that acupuncture may be clinically useful for the radical treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. p p p p p p "
"After intratesticular injection of a chromium hematoxylin and fluorescent nanoparticle solution, we found a novel flow path in the abdominal cavity consisting of primo-vessels and primo-nodes. This flow path formed a network that crossed over the surfaces of abdominal organs, and generally linked to the greater omentum and adjacent visceral peritoneum. Some of these structures terminated at organs such as the small intestine and the urinary bladder; occasionally, the network entered the parenchyma of organs. The semitransparent primo-vessels and nodes were wholly or partially stained dark-blue by chromium hematoxylin. Injected nanoparticles were also observed in primo-vessels and nodes as well as the parenchyma of organs which were the site of primo-vessel termination. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the primo-vessels consist of many sinuses (4–6 μm), surrounded by collagen fibers, specific granules, cellular remnants, immune cells, extracellular matrices, and hematopoietic cells. These histological features are completely different from blood and lymph vessels indicating that primo-vessels are novel structures that allow the flow of dye. "
"Research using medical imaging instruments such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has led to the proposal that the fascial network distributed over the human body is the anatomical basis for the acupoints and meridians of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, we put forward a new theory of anatomy called fascial anatomy. In fascial anatomy, a human body is divided into two major systems. One is the supporting-storing system of unspecialized connective tissues. The other is a functional system. An undifferentiated non-specific connective tissue network, with the participation of the nervous and the immune systems, constitutes the supporting-storing system of the human body. The various differentiated functional cells in the body that are supported and surrounded by the supporting-storing system constitute the functional system. The discipline that studies the supporting-storing system and the mutual relationship between this system and the functional system in a living human body is called fasciaology. The establishment of fascial anatomy and fasciaology opens a new research field in anatomy; consequently, fasciaology will play a significant role in biological medicine and traditional Chinese medical research, as well as future clinical practice. fasciaology fasciaology "
"Cold intolerance is an inability to tolerate cold temperatures and is accompanied by symptoms including headache, shoulder discomfort, dizziness and palpitations. The current study was performed to examine whether reflexology therapy affected cold intolerance in human subjects and whether the treatment was systemically effective. Ten female volunteer examinees with subjective feelings of cold were examined. After a 5-minute foot bath, 10 minutes of reflexology therapy was performed on their left foot. Skin temperature and blood flow were estimated before and after treatment, together with an interview concerning their feelings of cold and daily habits. In addition, how the recovery rate was affected by the application of a chilled-water load was also estimated. Along with significant increases in skin temperature and blood flow compared with pre-treatment at the bilateral points of KI-1, LR-3, and BL-60, a faster recovery after the application of the chilled-water load was also seen in the lower limbs on both sides. From these results, we conclude that reflexology has systemic effects and is an alternative method for treating cold intolerance. "
"The symptoms of neuropathic pain are often intractable because they are poorly relieved by conventional analgesics. This therapeutic area remains one of the least satisfactorily managed by current drugs. Effective therapy for this type of pain is lacking, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of sciatic nerve ligation on inducing neuropathic pain and to understand the mechanisms involved, and the effect of, an L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)/dextromethorphan combination therapy on reducing neuropathic pain. According to our results, L-NAME and dextromethorphan showed analgesic properties, but only 100 mg/kg L-NAME had an additive effect on the analgesic effects of dextromethorphan. Our observations support the idea that N-methyl-D-aspartate/nitric oxide pathways play an important role in the development of such sciatic nerve ligated-evoked pathological pain conditions, thus this combination therapy could be used instead of conventional treatment.

"The most difficult step in the morphological study of the internal organ-surface primo-vessel (Bong-Han duct) system is the correct identification of samples, due to similarities between torn mesentery and primo-vessel tissue. Without proper sample discernment, the subsequent parts of morphological studies cannot be trusted. Here, we present differences between torn mesentery and primo-vessel tissues as determined by minimal operation, using stereoscopic and microscopic observation. Stereoscopic observation revealed that torn mesentery is tightly connected to the organ surface and does not branch; the detached margin has a fan-shaped membrane without any swollen portions. Primo-vessels are slightly connected to the organ surface and branched, while detached margins lack a membrane and possess a swelling termed the primo-node (Bong-Han corpuscle). Microscopic observation shows bundle patterns in primo-vessel tissue, but irregular arrangement in torn mesentery tissue. These characteristics can be used to distinguish torn mesentery from primo-vessels. "
"The aim of this study was to determine whether pharmacopuncture is a clinically effective and safe method for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Patients were recruited between August 2008 and December 2008 at the Ilsan Hospital associated with Dongguk University. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The experimental group (n = 30) received pharmacopuncture using root bark of Ulmus davidiana Planch (UDP) twice a week for 6 weeks; the control group (n = 30) received normal saline injections. Fifty-three patients completed the trial. After the seventh treatment, we found that UDP pharmacopuncture was more effective in pain improvement using a Visual Analog Scale than was normal saline injection. However, the two interventions were not significantly different as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities pain score and total pain scores, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Korean Health Assessment Questionnaire. No subject showed any serious adverse effects. The effects of pharmacopuncture treatment were a combination of placebo, needle stimulation, mechanical effect of the solution, and a chemical effect of UDP. However, normal saline used as the control intervention displayed the first three effects, and thus its effect was not inert. This may have influenced the results of the trial, which was statistically insignificant between the two groups, except following the seventh treatment session. n Ulmus davidiana n n Ulmus davidiana n "
"In traditional Chinese medicine, the cause of weak bones or bone loss is generally regarded as a result of kidney deficiency. Fructus Cnidii (FC), which is also known as She-Chuang-Zi, is a traditional herb that has been claimed to have kidney warming effects that invigorate Yang. In this study, we tried to determine the bone production-inducing effect of FC on osteoblastic cells in vitro using osthole, the main component of FC. Osteoblasts were isolated from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat calvaria using the tissue piece culture method and treated with various concentrations of osthole ranging from 2.5 to 640 μg/mL, together with a blank control. Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and bone nodules were measured. The cells were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining, the Gomori Calcium-Cobalt method and immunofluorescent staining. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (or MTT) assay, ALP assay, and bone nodule results indicated significantly enhanced osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation at concentrations of osthole ranging from 40 to 320 μg/mL. Concentrations lower than 40 μg/ mL seemed less effective, and cytotoxicity to osteoblasts was observed at concentrations higher than 320 μg/mL. These results indicate that osthole is effective at inducing osteoblastic bone formation through the up-regulation of ALP activity. FC is a Chinese herb used to treat lumbar pain in clinical practice. Further studies concerning the effects and mechanism of osthole on osteoporotic patients and animals should be performed, as these studies may lead to the development of a drug treatment for osteoporosis in the future. in vitro in vitro "
"Meridian theory is a major part of Chinese medicine and has guided acupuncture and clinical practice for thousands of years. Meridian theory describes many important concepts about the rules of human body function and regulation, but has comparatively huge differences with the basic concepts of modern medicine. These differences have caused deep concern and attracted attention from scholars, both inside and outside of China. The interest in meridian theory lies in determining the structural nature of meridians. Not only is this information still unclear, it is very difficult to achieve clear results in a short period of time. Despite this, the phenomena of meridians can be used as the entry point for meridian studies. After many years of effort, although the physical structure of meridians has not been found, the existence of the meridian phenomena has been fully confirmed. Although there is a lack of morphological evidence for the existence of the meridian, concluding non-existence may be incorrect as morphology techniques develop and structures previously not determined are being found. Since the phenomenon of meridians exists, some biological basis behind its occurrence must be present. This implies that research on meridians needs to continue as research techniques advance and may eventually reveal the biological basis of the meridian phenomenon. In the present review, we analyze the history of meridian studies in China. "
"Ganoderma lucidum, a well-known medicinal mushroom, is highly valued and commonly used in Oriental medicine. Although recent experimental data has revealed the proapoptotic potency of G. lucidum extracts, the underlying mechanisms of this apoptotic activity have not yet been studied in detail. In the present study, the effects of ethanol extracts of G. lucidum (EGL) on the growth of an AGS human gastric carcinoma cell line were investigated. We found that EGL treatment resulted in a dose and time-dependent significant decrease in the viability of AGS cells. This decreased viability was caused by apoptotic cell death, with observed chromatin condensation and an accumulation of apoptotic fraction. EGL treatment induced the expression of death receptor-related proteins such as death receptor 5 and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, which further triggered the activation of caspase-8 and the cleavage of Bid. In addition, the increase in apoptosis that was induced by EGL was correlated with activation of caspase-9 and -3, downregulation of IAP family proteins such as XIAP and survivin, and concomitant degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover the activity of Akt was downregulated in EGL-treated cells, and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/ Akt inhibitor LY294002 sensitized the cells to EGL-induced apoptosis. The results indicated that EGL induces the apoptosis of AGS cells through a signaling cascade of death receptor-mediated extrinsic, as well as mitochondria-mediated intrinsic, caspase pathways which are associated with inactivation of the Akt signal pathway.

"This experimental study investigated the antitumor effect of Cordyceps militaris in NCI-H406 cell transplanted nude mice. After feeding an aqueous solution of C. militaris extracts in NCI-H460 cell xenografted nude mice for 4 weeks, we measured the size of a tumor mass and calculated the inhibition rate. We also estimated survival time and calculated mean survival time and percent increase in lifespan. Results showed that the inhibition rate of water extract of the 150 mg/kg/day C. militaris-administered group was 94.73-75.08% and that of the 300 mg/kg/day C. militaris-administered group was 85.81-73.81%. The tumor weights and volumes decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Mean survival time of the 150 mg/kg/day C. militaris-administered group was extended to 19.43 ± 2.44 days and 5.42% increased in lifespan (ILS) and that of the 300 mg/kg/day C. militaris-administered group was 21.86 ± 3.53 days and 18.61% ILS. The relative liver weight was significantly increased in 300 mg/kg/day C. militaris-administered group, but there was no histopathological difference. In conclusion, C. militaris, shrunk tumors and increased mouse lifespan, suggesting that C. militaris was effective in treating tumors in nude mice."
"This study is a review of the theoretical basis of Sa-Ahm Five Element acupuncture devised about 360 years ago. A total of 21 books and papers ranging from the ancient Huang Di Nei Jing to modern biomedical acupuncture for pain management were researched in relation to the Five Shu points. Gao-Wu, in the Chinese Ming Dynasty, used the Five Shu points for the first time based on the creation cycle as the tonification and sedation treatment, termed the “tonification and sedation treatment of self meridian”. Since then, and for no particular reason, this method has been rarely used until Sa-Ahm's new doctrine, which includes the concept of the destruction cycle, was asserted. Sa-Ahm Five Element acupuncture is a method in which the Five Shu points are used from the viewpoints of the simultaneous tonification and sedation methods that are based on the promotion and control cycles. Although it is currently the most utilized method in accordance with the practitioner's points, this method is in need of designated guidelines by which Sa-Ahm acupuncture can be practiced effectively.

"This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) of the spasmogenic action of Loranthus ferrugineus in isolated guinea pig ileum. Thus the contractile responses of guinea pig ileum to graded additions of either L. ferrugineus methanol extract or its n-butanol fraction were tested in the presence and absence of various pharmacological interventions. The data showed that L. ferrugineus methanol extract and the n-butanol fraction produced a concentration-dependent spasmogenic effect in isolated guinea pig ileum segments. These effects were significantly inhibited in the presence of 1 μM atropine. In contrast, the response to the lowest concentrations of L. ferrugineus methanol extract (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL) and n-butanol fraction of L. ferrugineus (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) were considerably enhanced in the presence of 0.05 μM neostigmine. Neither L. ferrugineus methanol extract nor n-butanol fraction contractile responses were affected upon the incubation of the ileal segments with 100 μM hexamethonium. The results of this study show that the spasmogenic effect of L. ferrugineus is possibly mediated through a direct action on intestinal muscarinic receptors. It is suggested that the bioactive constituents of L. ferrugineus serve as a substrate for acetylcholinesterase."
"Electrodermal screening (EDS) is based on three commonly held assumptions: acupuncture points (APs) have lower electrical resistance than non-APs; resistance at APs varies with health and disease; and effective acupuncture treatments are associated with normalization of resistance at APs. Although evidence confirming these assumptions is limited, EDS is frequently practiced worldwide. Researchers are also beginning to assess EDS' utility as an outcome measure in acupuncture trials. Fundamental in developing EDS as a research tool is the need for an accurate and reliable measurement. We developed an automated multichannel prototype system, the Octopus, and recorded electrical resistance and capacitance at eight skin sites in 33 healthy participants over 2 hours. The Octopus accurately measured against known resistors (within 2.5% of the mean value) and capacitors (within 10% of the mean value), and yielded repeatable readings at all eight skin sites: LR 1 (r=0.79), SP 1 (r=0.79), toe non-AP (r=0.77), LU 9 (r=0.97), PC 6 (r=0.96), wrist non-APs (r=0.97), SP 6 (r=0.96), and leg non-APs (r=0.97). Resistance at APs was significantly lower than the nearby non-APs in one out of three comparisons. "
"Moxibustion therapy chiefly utilizes heat generated by the combustion of moxa. Therefore, understanding the thermal properties of moxibustion is essential when studying the mechanisms involved in moxibustion therapy. Therefore, we measured temperatures of direct and indirect moxibustion. For indirect moxibustion, moxibustion on garlic was used. To determine the influence of the environment on moxibustion, we applied airflow of 0.0-0.8 m/s. An increase in the airflow caused a concomitant increase in the maximum temperature of direct moxibustion, from 160 to 300°C and the time duration was reduced by half. However, the maximum temperature of indirect moxibustion demonstrated the opposite effect, with the temperature decreasing from 45 to 40°C. This is attributed to the upstream airflow, which indicates the importance of the air inside moxa. For indirect moxibustion using garlic slices of different thicknesses, we found the optimum condition for the buffer layer of a garlic slice. The maximum number of consecutive moxibustions using one garlic slice was three. These results are consistent with traditional methods. This observation illustrates that the importance of garlic slices in modulating the combustion heat and proper thermal stimulus to the patient. "
"To investigate possible functions of acupuncture, oxygen (O2) levels were measured at two different acupuncture points (APs) [Hegu and Laogong] and at the corresponding non-APs (3-5 cm away from the APs) in real time using a high sensitive electrochemical O2 microsensor. The sensor had a small planar sensing platinum disk (diameter = 25 μm) and therefore was able to monitor the O2 levels at the localized APs. Significantly higher O2 levels (p < 0.05) were observed at both APs (n = 5, without exceptions) in comparison with the non-APs. Sufficient sensor sensitivity to distinguish the O2 level differences between APs and non-APs was achieved. This research provides useful information on possible functions of APs and meridians."
"Elephantopus tomentosus is widely used in Asia, especially in Malaysia, for the treatment of pain and inflammation. In the present study, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of a 95% ethanol extract of E. tomentosus were investigated in different experimental models. In the anti-inflammation study, 1000 mg/kg of extract significantly reduced carrageenan-induced hind paw edema (p < 0.05) and inhibited abdominal permeability compared with control (p < 0.01). The analgesic activity was assayed in several experimental models in mice: (1) hot plate, (2) tail flick, (3) writhing test; and rats: carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia pain threshold test. However, at the doses tested, no significant activity was found in the hot plate test and the tail flick test. E. tomentosus ethanol extract at 1000 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) increased hyperalgesia pain threshold and inhibited writhing activity. The results suggest that E. tomentosus ethanol extract at 1000 mg/kg dose is effective in anti-inflammatory and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug type anti-nociception activities."
"Objective This systematic review aimed to critically appraise published clinical trials designed to assess the effect of Tai Chi on psychosocial well-being. Data Sources Databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, HEALT, PsycINFO, CISCOM, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials of the Cochrane Library, and dissertations and conference proceedings from inception to August 2008. Review Methods Methodological quality was assessed using a modified Jadad scale. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (i.e. English publications of randomized controlled trials with Tai Chi as an intervention and psychological well-being as an outcome measure), of which eight were high quality trials. The psychosocial outcomes measured included anxiety (eight studies), depression (eight studies), mood (four studies), stress (two studies), general mental health three studies), anger, positive and negative effect, self-esteem, life satisfaction, social interaction and self-rated health (one study each). Results Tai Chi intervention was found to have a significant effect in 13 studies, especially in the management of depression and anxiety. Although the results seemed to suggest Tai Chi is effective, they should be interpreted cautiously as the quality of the trials varied substantially. Furthermore, significant findings were shown in only six high quality studies. Moreover, significant between group differences after Tai Chi intervention was demonstrated in only one high quality study (the other three significant results were observed in non-high quality studies). Two high quality studies in fact found no significant Tai Chi effects. Conclusion It is still premature to make any conclusive remarks on the effect of Tai Chi on psychosocial well-being. "
"Bonghan ducts (BHDs), and their associated Bonghan corpuscles (BHCs), which are novel threadlike structures, were recently observed in rats and rabbits by using various methods. As further support for the putative circulatory function of the novel threadlike structures (NTS), we investigated the presence and the origin of the endothelial cells within these structures. We immunostained the NTS with anti-CD146, an endothelial cell marker, and with anti-podoplanin, a lymphatic cell marker. Positive expression of CD146 in the BHDs was obtained, and the distribution of endothelial cells showed that the inner boundaries of the channels in the subducts branched from the BHDs and curled around, in a complicated manner, inside a BHCs. The negative expression of podoplanin implies that the endothelial cells in the BHDs are likely to be of vascular and not of lymphatic origin. "
"Two hours after Alcian Blue (AB) dye was injected at the rat acupoint BL23, the abdominal cavity was examined and AB-stained threadlike structures were observed on the right abdominal cavity. Those threadlike structures were mainly distributed on the surfaces of the duodenum, colon and cecum. These threadlike structures were thin (about 50 μm) and moved freely, and were connected to corpuscles that were about 500 × 200 μm wide and also stained with AB. On analyzing the histology of the threadlike structures, rod-shaped nuclei, bundles of collagen fibers, reticulofibers, and squamous-like epithelial cells were observed. Immune cells and some sinuses were inside the threadlike structures. These characteristics describe those of Bonghan ducts. The flow paths from the acupoint to internal organs can possibly be used as paths for drug delivery. "
"This experiment was conducted to evaluate inhibitory effects against lung metastasis and promotion of splenocytes by water extracts from various mushrooms including Armillaria mellea, Grifola frondosa, Garnoderma frondosa, Codyceps militaris, Hericium erinaceus, Coriolus versicolor, Agaricus Blazei with Lycium Chinense Miller (known as M8). Analysis of carbohydrate using HPTLC showed that β-glucan and pachyman were some of the major components of M8. Oral administration of M8 resulted in a dose-dependent tendency to inhibit lung metastasis after intravenous injection of colon26-L5 cells. Treatment with M8 resulted in a significant increase of T cell and B cell mitogenic stimuli. The population of CD3, CD19, CD4, and CD8 positive cells increased in a dose dependent manner of M8 administration. However, no significant results were obtained from the population of Mac-1 and NK1.1 positive cells. Oral administration of M8 resulted in the increased production of IFN-γ and IL-4 by splenocytes stimulated with Con A compared with untreated controls. These results show that M8 has antitumor activities which may be useful as an antimetastatic agent.

"This study aimed to understand energy metabolism distribution along the pericardium meridian and verify the correlation between the body surface (points), and classic meridian theory. A highly sensitive CO2 instrument was used to measure the transcutaneous CO2 emission at 13 points along the pericardium meridian line (12 points on the line and one point beyond the line) and 13 control points beside them. Results showed that the distribution of transcutaneous CO2 emission is highly related to the position on the body. Transcutaneous CO2 emission is significantly higher at P7 and P3, than the control points beside them. The points along the meridian and the points beside them were clustered with relative distance by SAS statistics software. Two distance matrixes were then obtained. The correlation coefficients between the points along the line and between the control points were calculated. The results showed that the 13th point beyond the line was far from the 12 points on the line (distance, 0.24), while acupoints on the line clustered earlier when compared with the non-acupoints. The average correlation coefficients among the acu-points was 0.65 which was significantly higher than 0.56, among the non-acupoints. No such characteristics were found among the control points. It was concluded that there is a strong correlativity of energy metabolism activity between the body surfaces along the meridian, and an even stronger correlativity between the acupoints on the meridian."
"Chan Su is a traditional Chinese medicine prepared from the dried white secretion of the auricular and skin glands of toads, and has been used as an oriental drug for the treatment of a number of diseases, including cancer. In this study, the potential of Chan Su (skin of Venenum Bufonis) to induce apoptosis in human lung carcinoma A549 cells was investigated. Treatment of A549 cells with skin of Venenum Bufonis resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and viability and the induction of apoptosis, which was shown by trypan blue counts, MTT assay, DAPI staining and flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis that was induced by skin of Venenum Bufonis was correlated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Fas ligand and death receptor 4, and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Skin of Venenum Bufonis treatment induced the proteolytic activation of caspases and a concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase and β-catenin protein. Cleavage of Bid and a down-regulation of the inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins were also observed in skin of Venenum Bufonis-treated A549 cells. Data from this study indicates that SVB induces the apoptosis of A549 cells through a signaling cascade of death receptor-mediated extrinsic and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic caspase pathways.

"This study compared the effects of distilled Rehmannia glutinosa, Wild Ginseng and Astragali Radix pharmacopuncture on the autonomic nervous system and heart rate variability. The purpose of the trial was to observe the influence distilled Astragali Radix, Wild Ginseng and Rehmannia glutinosa pharmacopuncture have on the autonomic nervous system. 120 healthy male volunteers were divided into four groups, which consisted of three experimental groups and a control group. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Volunteers in experimental groups were underwent pharmacopuncture at GB21 (Kyonjong), and volunteers in the control group were injected with normal saline at GB21 (Kyonjong). Heart rate variability was measured seven times: before and after injection, every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. The result was distilled Rehmannia glutinosa, Wild Ginseng and Astragali Radix pharmacopuncture in healthy adult males tended to activate the autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system.

"Introduction Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is one of the most important antioxidant enzymes present in all oxygen-metabolizing cells. This enzyme eliminates toxins from our body, so it is vital to understand its action and activity under the influence of different wavelengths. The effects of different wavelengths of light in the visible range on SOD activity were investigated. Methods Enzyme samples were irradiated with five different wavelengths for chromotization. The absorbance values of the control and treated enzymes were subsequently measured. Results A wavelength of 644 nm (red) showed the maximum increase in absorbance compared with all other color wavelengths used. Yellow showed least absorption. Conclusion Red color wavelength actually provides additional energy to the enzyme and hence the activation energy is lowered, compared with untreated enzyme. "
"Basic and clinical research in traditional Chinese and Korean acupuncture has been performed at the Research Unit of Biomedical Engineering in Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Center at the Medical University of Graz since 1997. This publication focuses on the latest innovative aspects that underline the further enhancement and development of acupuncture. In this context, novel biomedical and neuroscientific methods are of paramount importance for the fast and efficient modernization of the ancient Asian healing method. Traditional and future oriented acupuncture stimulation methods can be divided into manual needle, laser needle (blue, red and infrared laser light) and electrical punctual stimulation at the body, hand and ear. Special emphasis in this research article is given to totally new technical and methodological investigations, e.g. the first data published worldwide in medicine obtained with new blue laser acupuncture equipment. In this regard, critical summary and recent results from peripheral and central measurements during acupuncture stimulation using high-tech bioengineering assessment are given. In addition, we describe the first teleacupuncture performed between Asia and Europe. "
"The present study evaluates the potential effects of Sanyak (Dioscoreae rhizome) on the regenerative capacity of the peripheral sciatic nerve after crush injury in rats. Focal application of Sanyak extract at the injury site increased GAP-43 and Cdc2 protein levels in the distal portion of the injured nerve. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the signals of phospho-vimentin as Cdc2 substrate protein were almost colocalized with Cdc2. Retrograde DiI-tracing revealed enhancement in distal elongation of regenerating axons. Furthermore, the number of non-neuronal cells was higher in Sanyak-treated animals than saline controls. Thus, these data suggest that Sanyak extract is effective for promoting regenerative responses in injured peripheral neurons. Dioscoreae rhizome Dioscoreae rhizome "
"The Bonghan system is a newly-discovered circulatory system, which corresponds to classical acupuncture meridians and was discovered in the early 1960s by Bonghan Kim. Despite its potential importance in biology and medicine, it has been ignored or forgotten for a long time. Only recently have most of its significant parts, such as the Bonghan system (BHS) inside blood or lymph vessels, on the surfaces of internal organs, and in brain ventricles, been confirmed. For this, novel methods using modern technology were necessary because Bonghan Kim did not describe his methods. For example, Among other methods, the discovery of a BHS-specific dye, trypan blue, was one of the most important original contributions that made BHS observation possible. With this technique, the BHS in adipose tissue became traceable, and the BHS was discovered on the fascia surrounding tumor tissues, a finding which may have great significance in relation to serious health problems in modern society, namely, obesity and cancer.

"Objectives A study was performed on the effects of stimulation at Zusanli-point (ST.36) by electroacupuncture (EA) at two frequencies on the bioavailability of 99mTc-sodium pertechnetate (Na99mTcO4) in rats. 99m 99m 4 99m 99m 4 Methods Forty Wistar rats were divided into four groups: untreated control, treated by manual acupuncture at ST.36 bilaterally, treated by EA at 2 Hz at ST.36 bilaterally, and the same site at 100 Hz bilaterally. Na99mTcO4(7.4 MBq) was administrated via the ocular-plexus and, 20 minutes before sacrifice, blood was withdrawn for radiolabeling assay (BRL). In the bioavailability analysis, organs and tissues were isolated, their radioactivity determined, and the percentage of injected dose per gram of organ or tissue (%ID/g) and the %ID were calculated for each organ or tissue (%ID/ot). For BRL, the plasma and blood cells isolated, and the fractions also precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions; these were assessed as percentage of injected dose (%ID) in blood (%ID/b). 99m 4 99m 4 Results The results showed significant differences in the %ID/g in some organs and tissues in comparison with controls; lung (p = 0.0013), spleen (p = 0.0085), pancreas (p = 0.0167), liver (p = 0.0003), stomach (p<0.0001), small-intestine (p = 0.0181), large-intestine (p = 0.04099), urinary-bladder (p = 0.0271), thyroid (p< 0.0001), muscle (p = 0.0187); %ID/ot in spleen (p = 0.0349); and %ID/b in blood sample (p = 0.0235). In the blood labeling analyses, EA in either frequency significantly increased insoluble fraction/blood cells (p < 0.0001). Conclusions These findings suggested that acupuncture procedures at ST.36 could modulate responses in some organs, tissues, and blood in rats. Further rigorous experimental studies to examine the effectiveness in either acupuncture therapy need to be pursued. "
"Objectives Treatment by manual acupuncture needling affects the vascular wall tone, and hemodynamic parameters for arterial stiffness may be characterized by treatment at the traditional acupuncture point (acupoint) of Baihui (GV20). Methods The acute effects of acupuncture treatment on arterial stiffness and wave reflection were investigated and, simultaneously, an augmentation index (AI), as an index of wave reflection, was estimated. These parameters were measured in male volunteers using applanation tonometry during 20 minutes of acupuncture treatment and 40 minutes post-acupuncture. Results During treatment, diastolic blood pressure (BP), but not systolic BP, increased significantly. Heart rates (HR) initially tended to increase and then decrease. The AI from radial arteries increased significantly, while central aortic blood pressure (CBP) was unaffected. Post-acupuncture, the effects lasted for 30-40 minutes. The average BP and HR were +10.1±0.3% and −7.2±0.2%, respectively, and the CBPs were not altered, but the AI decreased markedly; this latter effect presumably resulted from the involvement of neurovascular modulators. Conclusions These results indicated that acute treatment at Baihui enhanced arteriosclerotic parameters. In post-acupuncture, the AI profoundly decreased, presumably resulting from the involvement with neurovascular modulators. "
"Objective The present study has been designed to find a possible new route for the metastasis of cancer cells on the fascia surrounding tumor tissue using a novel technique of trypan blue staining. Materials and Methods Tumor tissues were grown in the skin of nude mice after sub-cutaneous inoculation with human lung cancer cells. Trypan blue was recently identified as a dye with specificity for Bonghan ducts (BHDs) and not other tissues, such as blood or lymph vessels or nerves. Results We demonstrate that the trypan blue staining technique allows the first visualization of BHDs which are connected to tumor tissues. Conclusion Since BHDs are known to make up a circulatory system corresponding to acu puncture meridians or collaterals, we propose that, in addition to the currently known blood or lymph vessels, BHDs on tumor tissue fascia may be a novel pathway for metastasis.

"Objective To show that the characteristic morphological and ultrastructural features of a Bonghan corpuscle and duct presented here are consistent with the description given in the early reports of Bonghan Kim. Materials and Methods We compared the morphological aspects of Bonghan ducts with those of blood and lymphatic capillaries on the ultrastructural level to display the manifestly distinctive nature of the Bonghan system. Results The walls of the ductules were observed to be composed of a single layer of endothelial cells with characteristic rod-shaped nuclei and were not surrounded by a basal lamina or by accessory cells, such as pericytes or smooth muscle cells. The abluminal cell membranes of Bonghan ductules were not attached by anchoring filaments to the fibers of extracellular matrices as observed in lymphatic capillaries. The cytoplasmic processes of ductule endothelial cells appear to form overlapping and interdigitated interconnections which completely lack junctional elements. Although the cytoplasm of ductule endothelial cells contained a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and many free ribosomes and polysomes, there was a relatively small number of pinocytotic vesicles and lacks specific organelles, such as Weibel-Palade bodies. Conclusions The Bonghan corpuscles are specialized structures consisting of different types of immune cells randomly scattered as single cells in the matrix or clustered in follicle-like formations. Moreover, the Bonghan ductules in the corpuscle contain flowing immune cells and occasionally basophilic bodies. "
"Objectives Acupuncture meridians in traditional Oriental medicine are known to be channels connecting specific points in the surface of the body to corresponding internal organs. We investigated the permeation and the transport of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent and tracer after injection at acupoints of small animals, such as rats and mice. Methods A geometric and systematic arrangement of acupuncture points on human skin surfaces has been depicted in traditional Oriental medicine, and the positions of the acupoints of small animals were determined by the application of a proportion on the animals corresponding to the morphological structures in humans. After injecting the materials at various acupoints, the agent migration behaviors inside the body were monitored by MRI. The distributions of the injected materials were reconstructed in 3-dimensional images for a more intuitive presentation. Results The widely-used gadolinium-compound contrast agent was not useful. Rather, a recently developed fluorine compound was effective for imaging the migration of the agent after injection into the acupoints BL18, 20, and 23. Conclusions The final distributions of the agent from each injection point corresponded to the respective organs of the acupoints. The results suggested different migration paths and destinations for pharmacopuncture drugs. "
"Objectives The origin of adult stem cells remains an open question. If they derive from embryos, it is difficult to determine the mechanism which interrupts their differentiation during tissue formation. In the 1960s, the Bonghan microcell was suggested as one possible, yet to be described, route of stem cell production, such that they have the potential to proliferate to produce normal cells. Materials and Methods In this study, Bonghan microcells were isolated from Bonghan tissues on rat organ surfaces, and their detailed morphology examined by electron and atomic force microscopy. Results The ultrastructure observed distinguished them from apoptotic bodies and other microorganisms, and their unique, possible proliferation feature, as protruding threads, was imaged by atomic force microscopy. Conclusions The unique threadlike structure of the Bonghan microcell is consistent with Prof. Kim's observation in the first step of making a cell. Understanding of the functions of this threadlike structure may give a clue to understand the origin or the differentiation cue of adult stem cells. "
"Objectives Hypoglycemia induced by electroacupuncture (EA) is due to an increase of insulin secretion and/or mediation of β-endorphin. We applied EA at the Zusanli (ST.36) acupuncture point (acupoint) in combination with rosiglitazone (TZD) administration to evaluate their effect on plasma glucose and to explore possible mechanisms of action. Methods Thirty six normal adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: the 0.1 mg/kg TZD group (0.1TZD), 0.1 mg/kg TZD and EA group (0.1TZD + EA), EA group, and control group. In other experiments, streptozotocin was used to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus in neonatal rats; these were then randomly divided into a 0.1TZD group, 0.1TZD + EA group, and EA group and changes in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations evaluated. Results A marked hypoglycemic response was observed in the normal rat 0.1TZD, 0.1TZD + EA and EA groups, with the response more significant in the 0.1TZD + EA group than in the 0.1TZD group. Among the diabetic animals, the hypoglycemic responses in the 0.1TZD + EA and EA groups were greater than in the 0.1TZD group. In both the normal and diabetic rats, insulin secretion was increased by EA or 0.1TZD + EA treatment, but not by 0.1TZD. Conclusions The plasma glucose lowering action of rosiglitazone was increased by EA in both normal and diabetic rats, indicating that the application of EA may enhance the hypoglycemic action of this insulin sensitizer.

"Objectives This study was performed to investigate the toxicity of Secretio Bufonis (SB) on male mice and assess its no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). Materials and Methods After feeding an aqueous solution of SB extracts to mice for either 1 or 8 weeks, their blood and urine were assayed and their liver and kidney morphology examined. The numerical data was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-test and analysis of variance test. Results Mice administered SB in 50 mg/kg/day for 1 week had higher heart weights and higher aspartate transaminase activities; those administered SB in 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks had lower creatinine concentrations; and those administered SB in 0.5 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks had higher brain weights and higher blood urea nitrogen. Conclusions The extracts of SB had cardiac toxicity in the short term and hepatotoxicity in the long term. The NOAEL of the extract was under 5 mg/kg/day for 1 week and under 0.25 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks. "
"For at least 2,500 years, acupuncture has been an integral part of traditional Chinese medicine. However, recently as more people in western countries are diagnosed with chronic disease poorly treated with modern medical therapies, many are turning to acupuncture and other forms of alternative medical treatments. Based on the theory of harmonious flowing qi being the basis of good health, acupuncture focuses on restoring qi by manipulation of the complementary and opposing elements of yin and yang. However, in the modern medical community we struggle to with the concept of qi, given a lack of anatomic and histological evidence supporting its existence. However, with the surge in public interest in acupuncture, the scientific community begun heavy investigation of acupuncture's efficacy, as well as the physiologic basis behind it. Thus far, evidence supports the use of acupuncture in post-operative nausea and vomiting, postoperative dental pain, chronic pain conditions such as lower back pain, and possibly also such psychologic conditions as addiction. It is possible that by affecting afferent nerve signaling, acupuncture may influence the release of endogenous opioids to promote pain relief. This effect may be augmented by release of ACTH and cortisol, as well as through down-regulation of signaling through pain fibers. When treating patients who may utilize alternative forms of medicine, it is important that medical practitioners be educated in regards to the basic fundamental beliefs behind acupuncture, as well as the scientific evidence supporting its use and revealing its efficacy. The purpose of this review is to give western trained physicians exposure to history, basic knowledge and its clinical applications of acupuncture to accommodate accelerating interests in acupuncture in modern society. qi qi yin yang qi qi qi yin yang qi "
"The concept of intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions and evidence for their existence was introduced by Agnati and Fuxe in 1980/81 suggesting the existence of heteromerization of receptors. In 1982, they proposed the existence of aggregates of multiple receptors in the plasma membrane and coined the term receptor mosaics (RM). In this way, cell signaling becomes a branched process beginning at the level of receptor recognition at the plasma membrane where receptors can directly modify the ligand recognition and signaling capacity of the receptors within a RM. Receptor-receptor interactions in RM are classified as operating either with classical cooperativity, when consisting of homomers or heteromers of similar receptor subtypes having the same transmitter, or non-classical cooperativity, when consisting of heteromers. It has been shown that information processing within a RM depends not only on its receptor composition, but also on the topology and the order of receptor activation determined by the concentrations of the ligands and the receptor properties. The general function of RM has also been demonstrated to depend on allosteric regulators (e.g., homocysteine) of the receptor subtypes present. RM as integrative nodes for receptor-receptor interactions in conjunction with membrane associated proteins may form horizontal molecular networks in the plasma membrane coordinating the activity of multiple effector systems modulating the excitability and gene expression of the cells. The key role of electrostatic epitope-epitope interactions will be discussed for the formation of the RM. These interactions probably represent a general molecular mechanism for receptor-receptor interactions and, without a doubt, indicate a role for phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events in these interactions. The novel therapeutic aspects given by the RMs will be discussed in the frame of molecular neurology and psychiatry and combined drug therapy appears as the future way to go. "
"Acupuncture in Oriental medicine has been widely used as a core therapeutic method due to its minimal side-effects and therapeutic efficacy. However, the electrical response to acupuncture stimulation (ERAS) has not been clearly studied under acupuncture conditions that might affect the efficacy of acupuncture therapy. In this study, the ERAS was objectively investigated by measuring meridian electric potentials (MEPs) when the electrical grounding conditions of the operator and subject were varied, and when the insulation conditions of acupuncture needle were varied. MEPs between Sang-geoheo (ST37) and Ha-geoheo (ST39) of the Stomach Meridian (ST) were measured by stimulating Jok-samni (ST36) with an acupuncture needle. For non-insulated acupuncture stimulation (NIAS), the average MEP peak was 148.6 ± 20.6 when neither the operator nor the subject were electrically grounded, 23.1 ± 8.8 when the subject only was electrically grounded, 348 ± 76.8 when the operator only was electrically grounded, and 19.9 ± 4.7 when both the operator and the subject were electrically grounded. The MEPs presented various magnitudes and patterns depending on the electrical grounding conditions. The MEP pattern was very similar to that of the charge and discharge of a capacitor. For insulated acupuncture stimulation (IAS), the average MEP peak was 20 ± 4 in all electrical grounding conditions, which is not a significant electric response for acupuncture stimulation. In terms of electricity, this study verified that acupuncture therapy might be affected by acupuncture conditions such as (1) the electrical grounding condition of the operator and the subject and (2) the insulation condition of the acupuncture needle.

"Researches on auricular acupuncture (AA) have examined mainly its treatment effects. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy and precision of using auricular examination (AE) as a complementary diagnostic tool for screening hepatic disorders. Twenty patients suffering from liver dysfunction and 25 controls aged 18–60 years were recruited from an acute hospital. Participants were examined using three AE methods including visual inspection, electrical skin resistance measurement, and tenderness testing on the liver AA zone of both ears. Significant differences were found in visual inspection and electrical skin resistance on the AA zones between the two groups. Patients suffering from liver dysfunction tended to have at least one abnormality in skin color, appearance, presence of papules, abundance of capillary and desquamation on the ear (Relative Risk—Right ear: RR = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 6.2; Left: RR = 1.8, 95% CI, 1.01, 3.1). The sensitivity for visual inspection was 0.7 for both ears; specificity was 0.76 for the (R) and 0.6 for the (L) ear. The mean difference in electrical skin resistance was 4.3 MΩ (95% CI, 1.7, 6.9) for the (L) ear; 4.5 MΩ (95% CI, 1.5, 7.6) for the (R) ear. Our results suggest that malfunction of the liver appeared to be reflected by the presence of morphological changes on the liver AA zone. Visual inspection and electrical skin resistance on the liver AA zone are potentially sensitive to screen hepatic disorders. "
"Aims There are many biological investigations for determining an effective cure for the dysfunction of gastrointestinal tracts, using herbal medicine. It has been reported that Carum Copticum is a bactericidal agent and possesses anticholinergic, antihistaminic and b-adrenergic stimulatory effects in some tissues. However, these effects of Carum Copticum on mechanical activities of isolated intestine are not clearly identified yet. The present study has been designed to find out the specific effects of Carum Copticum on mechanical activity of isolated rat's ileum. Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Materials and Methods In this study rat's ileum contraction was recorded through an isolated tissue chamber in an organ bath by using isotonic transducer and oscillographic device. The effect of Carum Copticum extract on acetylcholine induced contraction in isolated rat's ileum was evaluated. Carum Copticum Carum Copticum Results Our findings showed that 1% aqueous extract of Carum Copticum reduces the basal contractile activity of rat's ileum. The extract also reduced acetylcholine induced contraction to 40% of its maximum response. The inhibitory action of Carum Copticum extract on acetylcholine induced contraction was similar but slower than that of atropine sulfate.

"We investigated ultraweak photon emissions from the hands of 45 healthy persons before and after magneto-acupuncture stimuli. Photon emissions were measured by using two photomultiplier tubes in the spectral range of UV and visible. Several statistical quantities such as the average intensity, the standard deviation, the δ-value, and the degree of asymmetry were calculated from the measurements of photon emissions before and after the magneto-acupuncture stimuli. The distributions of the quantities from the measurements with the magneto-acupuncture stimuli were more differentiable than those of the groups without any stimuli and with the sham magnets. We also analyzed the magneto-acupuncture stimuli effects on the photon emissions through a year-long measurement for two subjects. The individualities of the subjects increased the differences of photon emissions compared to the above group study before and after magnetic stimuli. The changes on the ultraweak photon emission rates of hand for the magnet group were detected conclusively in the quantities of the averages and standard deviations. "
"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Fu Zi on changes in the body heat of dogs. Twelve clinically healthy dogs were divided into two groups: the control group (six dogs) and the experimental group (six dogs). The control group was made to ingest normal saline mixed with canned meat, while the experimental group was made to ingest the Fu Zi solution mixed with canned meat. The infrared thermographic system was used to determine the level of body heat generated by these dogs. These areas include the dorsocranial (DCr), dorsocaudal (DCd), ventrocranial (VCr), and ventrocaudal (VCd) regions at pretreatment and were determined at 10, 20, 30, 50, 90, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after treatment for each of these areas. The results showed a tendency toward increased body heat until 30 minutes after ingestion of the Fu Zi powder mixed with canned meat. The significant differences in the changes of body heat were detected at 360 minutes in the DCd regions, 20 minutes in the VCr regions, and 30 minutes in the VCd regions between the experimental and control groups (p < 0.05). Based from our results, we find that Fu Zi can increase and maintain the dogs' body heat for at least 6 hours. p p "
"A visualizing agent, Trypan blue, was found to be preferentially effective for Bonghan ducts (BHDs) and corpuscles compared to blood vessels or adipose tissues. By using it, we observed a weblike network of BHDs which was in various membrane structures, such as the peritoneum, and omenta. This network of BHDs in the membrane structures was connected to the freely movable BHDs which did not adhere to the surfaces or wrapping membranes of internal organs. In addition, tracing BHDs in adipose tissues became possible because Trypan blue does not stain adipose tissue. "
"Blood plexuses are characteristic anatomical features of acupuncture points (APs). We developed an optical technique using diffusive light illumination to increase the brightened area of skin for observation of the blood plexuses in skin. We found that the blood plexuses were coiled blood vessels which came out of the perforations in the fascia of muscle. The coiled vessels could be straightened by stretching the skin. We observed a series of blood plexuses at the putative APs along the left and right kidney meridian lines in the abdominal skin of rats. In addition, the locations of the plexuses on the muscle fascia were just above the putative acupuncture muscle channels along the kidney meridians. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of the skin specimens of the plexuses revealed its neurovascular bundle nature as expected from known anatomical features of the APs. "
"We studied the effects of visible range irradiation (in vitro) on the enzyme solutions (glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase + cholesterol esterase and lipase) in order to infer the changes produced in the human body after chromotherapy. The glucose oxidase showed enhanced activity to the color purple (464 nm), while the activity of the other enzymes, cholesterol esterase + cholesterol oxidase and lipase, increased when exposed to dark violet (400 nm). Purple is being used in conventional chromo-therapy for diabetes, as supported by the experimental observation in which purple enhanced the activity of enzymes responsible for the oxidation of glucose. Specific wavelengths regulate living processes by acting as catalysts in enzyme activity, while some wavelengths may reduce enzyme activity. The irradiation of specific wavelengths effect enzymatic processes, which as a consequence, accelerated biochemical reactions. This particular frequency when provided to the enzymes (in vitro) lead to changes which may well be occurring in vivo."
"Spontaneous photon signals from four sites of a human subject suffering from multiple sclerosis were detected in 3600 bins of 50 milliseconds by a photo multiplier sensitive in 160–630nm, before and after a session of colorpuncture treatment. Measurements were made in 22 sessions over a period of 9 months. Each signal was analyzed to determine if it was a quantum signal in a squeezed state. The analysis first generates 10 signals of bin sizes (50 to 500 milliseconds at 50 millisecond intervals) by merging the counts at contiguous bins of the observed signal and then estimates three squeezed state parameters (r, θ and ϕ) in these ten signals and nine other combinations of signals. All estimations yield r=2.72·10−10, θ = 101.91° and ϕ = 69.53° for TolX=10−8 in every signal of a healthy subject. These are normal values of the parameters. Other values of parameters in a signal of any estimation indicate some ailment. The deviation from the squeezed state description of a signal is quantified by a new property, “coherency index”, which appears to be a good indicator of health. A session of colorpuncture treatment changed coherency indices of signals from different sides and provided relief to the subject suffering from multiple sclerosis. The changes in coherency indices and relief were temporary. Changes in coherency indices lasting for longer periods occurred after many sessions of treatment. −10 −8 −10 −8 "

"The use of laser light as an alternative to needles to stimulate acupuncture points has been promoted for almost three decades. However, there has been no systematic assessment of the evidence to support the effectiveness of this form of acupuncture to date. A systematic review was therefore undertaken of RCTs evaluating laser acupuncture as a primary intervention. Relevant studies (n = 18) were identified using computer-based literature searches and selected hand searches. Evidence was found to support the use of laser acupuncture in the treatment of myofascial pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting and for the relief of chronic tension headache. Laser acupuncture would appear to represent an effective form of acupuncture for the management of these conditions and could be considered as a viable alternative to more traditional forms of acupuncture point stimulation. n n "
"Background As obesity is becoming an epidemic, diet programs, including low-calorie diets, are continuously being developed. It is generally believed that a low-calorie diet is commonly followed by a resting metabolic rate decrease and ultimate weight regain. Ephedra sinica and evodia rutaecarpa are known to have sympathomimetic and anti-obesity effects. Ephedra sinica evodia rutaecarpa Ephedra sinica evodia rutaecarpa Design and Objective This study was a prospective; double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of ephedra sinica and evodia rutaecarpa on resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition and short-term safety in obese Korean premenopausal women on a low-calorie diet. ephedra sinica evodia rutaecarpa ephedra sinica evodia rutaecarpa Methods One hundred and twenty-five otherwise healthy obese women (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2) were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: ephedra group (n = 41), evodia group (n = 45) and placebo group (n = 39). Subjects were administered ephedra extract in capsules (pseudo-ephedrine 31.52 mg) or evodia extract in capsules (evodiamine 6.75 mg, rutaecarpine 0.66 mg) or placebo capsules as well as participating in a low-calorie diet for 8 weeks. Resting metabolic rate and body composition were measured at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. Basic serum tests were performed to evaluate the short-term safety and lipid-lowering effects of the herbs. Results All three groups showed significant body mass index (BMI) decreases, probably due to the low-calorie diet. Among the groups, the most prominent BMI-reducing effect was seen in the ephedra group. In RMR, no significant change in any group or significant difference among the groups was found. No significant adverse effects were observed in serum tests or in the self-questionnaire. Conclusion Ephedra combined with a low-calorie diet was effective in reducing BMI. RMR change was not compensated for by the herbal medicines tried. RMR change seemed to be affected by constitution and body composition rather than by medicine. Ephedra and evodia were proven to be safe for short-term use in the herbal form. "
"Recent studies have shown that specific sites of the skin related to the acupoints contain a high concentration of catecholamines, especially noradrenaline (NA). Considering this newly discovered property of the acupoints we assumed that heterogeneous distribution of cutaneous catecholamines could be associated with a specific location of catecholamine-storing cells in acupoint sites. In the present work we used an immunohistochemical method and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the presence of catecholamine-storing cells at acupoints of rabbits. Double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against adrenaline and NA revealed only the cells storing NA in the dermal layer of rabbit skin. NA-storing cells were randomly scattered as single cells as well as existing in small clusters in a globular tissue formation surrounded by blood vessels and capillaries. Microscopic analysis of histological sections also revealed that the distribution of NA-storing cells was closely associated with the location of acupoints. Thus results from our study strongly suggest that acupoint areas of rabbit skin contain catecholamine-storing cells which can release a high level of NA during acupuncture stimulation. "
"Objective As data on the safety profile of Panax ginseng and Hericium erinaceum is lacking, the safety of these two compounds was examined in a series of toxicological studies. Panax ginseng Hericium erinaceum Panax ginseng Hericium erinaceum Materials and Methods MUNOPHIL, the water extract mixture of Panax ginseng and Hericium erinaceum was tested in an oral subchronic 28-day toxicity study in rats at doses of 1250, 2500 and 5000 mg/kg/day. Panax ginseng Hericium erinaceum Panax ginseng Hericium erinaceum Results In repeated dose toxicity studies, no mortality was observed when varying doses of the extracts were administered once daily for a period of 28 days. There were no significant differences in body weight, absolute and relative organ weights between controls and treated rats of both sexes. Hematological analysis showed no differences in most parameters examined. In the biochemistry parameter analysis, no significant change occurred. Pathologically, neither gross abnormalities nor his-topathological changes were observed. Therefore, MUNOPHIL appears to be safe and non-toxic in these studies and a no-observed adverse effect level in rats was established at 5000 mg/kg/day. Conclusion The data could provide satisfactory preclinical evidence of safety to launch clinical trials on standardized formulation of plant extracts. "
"This work further investigates the mechanisms of pharmacopuncture based on clinical data from patients with dorsopathy at the lumbosacral level. For the first time, pharmacopuncture was analyzed from the perspective of “classical” medicine and not using homeopathic medicine preconceptions. This confirmed the benefits of the chondro-protector Alflutop. The reduction of the vaso-reflectory reactions observed in this study indicates an extension of its therapeutic uses at the expense of the pharmacopuncture reflectory mechanisms. In turn, the data obtained point the way to further study into the active mechanism of pharmacopuncture. Alflutop Alflutop "
"Research on the Bonghan system has recently prompted great interest in the theory proposed by Bong Han Kimin in the early 1960s. In order to study the biochemical characteristics of the Bonghan system, we analyzed Bonghan ducts (BHD) on the surface of rabbit intestines and characterized the liquid in the BHD at the level of the proteome. Proteomic analysis was performed using nano LC-ESI MS/MS. Using a solution digestion technique, we identified 70 different proteins in the liquid of the BHD. We used gel-based digestion to analyze the BHD itself and our results showed the presence of 207 proteins. We used these proteins to analyze gene ontology (GO) to yield insights into biological processes, molecular functions and cellular compartmentalization. Remarkably, GO clustering showed high concentrations of proteins involved in metabolism. These proteins are not usually found in blood, lymph or blood vessels, and thus can be useful for characterizing BHD. It is worth studying their association with stem cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells and myeloid cells. "
"Objective Electrodermal screening is widely used in the acupuncture community for point location, diagnosis and therapy. However the underlying theory that electrical skin resistance (ESR) of an area corresponding to an acupuncture point (AP) is lower than ESR of the surrounding areas is yet to be proven. The objective of this study was to evaluate and quantify the phenomenon of ESR changes at the Gallbladder 34 (GB34) Acupuncture Point (AP). Materials and Methods In this single-blinded study GB34 was measured bilaterally in 43 healthy volunteers. Electrical skin resistance measurements (ESRMs) were performed with a specially designed array consisting of 64 (8 × 8) electrodes on an area of 6 × 6 cm. Then the electrodes corresponding to the AP were identified and compared with those of the surrounding electrodes with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Values for p of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. p p Results Eighty-one ESRMs were evaluated. ESR was significantly different from the surrounding skin area in 27 (33.3%) cases with 15 (18.5%) points showing a lower and 12 (14.1%) points showing a higher ESR. Conclusion This shows that ESR changes at APs exist in one third of the measured points, a very low rate for a postulation that forms the basis of various diagnosis and therapy systems. "
"Sixteen shorthorn cows from Xiazhuang farm were admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University for evaluation of poor appetite, listlessness, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, lethargy, positive jugular venous pulse and anemia. Blood smear examination and polymerase chain reaction analysis in these cows revealed an infection with Mycoplasma wenyonii. The subjects were divided into two groups: control group (three cows) treated with intramuscular injection with imidocarb dipropionate (3 mg/kg/day for 2 days) and the experimental group (13 cows), treated with injection-acupuncture (Imidocarb Dipropionate, 1 mg/kg, once every 3 days for 6 days) at BL17, BL18, BL20, BL25, ST36, SP06 and CV04. At day 15, negative results were found using blood smear examination in all control and experimental groups. Mycoplasma wenyonii. Mycoplasma wenyonii. "
"Due to the lack of an appropriate placebo, the general scientific community has questioned studies on the effects of acupuncture. The double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial is said to be the gold standard for showing that a treatment has a specific effect over placebo. But acupuncture treatments undoubtedly involve placebo effects. In order to aid the study of the effects of acupuncture and to give more credibility to acupuncture studies in the eyes of the general scientific community using evidence based medicine, a thoroughly tested double-blind placebo for acupuncture needs to be developed. Investigations on a sham endermic acupuncture needle were performed. Experienced subjects were tested for an ability to distinguish real acupuncture from sham acupuncture in appearance and skin sensation. From receiving real or sham acupuncture treatment, experienced subjects from the public correctly identified 55.8% of treatments from appearance and 56.7% from skin sensation. Acupuncturists identified 45% of treatments from appearance and 55% from skin sensation. When experienced subjects of acupuncture treatment from the public received both real and sham treatment side-by-side in each hand, they were able to identify 60% with appearance and sensation and 66.7% with only skin sensation. It is possible that this sham acupuncture could be used as the placebo for further research on the effects of acupuncture. "
"The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of acupuncture on the perception of pain and coping strategies, thus focusing on the psychological aspects of pain. The study was conducted in two complementary and alternative medicine clinics of public hospitals. Forty-one patients scheduled for routine acupuncture therapy because of chronic musculoskeletal pain were recruited for the study to receive eight acupuncture treatments. Twenty-four patients completed the treatment schedule and filled two self-reported questionnaires before and after therapy: (1) Illness Perception Questionnaire—Revised (IPQ-R); and (2) Coping Strategies questionnaire (Brief COPE). A significant improvement was found in the following measures related to pain perception: timeline (chronic versus acute), treatment control, and personal control. Additionally, significant improvement was displayed in three measures related to coping strategies: positive reframing, religion, and venting. The results indicate that acupuncture therapy might be efficient in changing patient's pain perception from chronic to acute and in enhancing their sense of personal and treatment control over their pain. In addition, acupuncture therapy partially improved coping strategies. The present study provides further validation for acupuncture therapy in pain and highlights its possible role in affecting the psychological aspects of pain. "
"Acupuncture is the practice of inserting needles into the body to reduce pain or induce anesthesia. More broadly, acupuncture is a family of procedures involving the stimulation of anatomical locations on or in the skin by a variety of techniques. Employing acupuncture to treat human disease or maintain bodily condition has been practiced for thousands of years. However, the mechanism(s) of action of acupuncture at the various meridians are poorly understood. Most studies have indicated that acupuncture is able to increase blood flow. The acupuncture points have high electrical conductance and a relationship of the acupuncture points and meridians with the connective tissue planes and the perivascular space has also been suggested. Several studies employing the human and animal models have shown that acupuncture enhances the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and increases local circulation. Specifically, electroacupuncture (EA) seems to prevent the reduction in NO production from endothelial NO synthetase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) that is associated with hypertension and this process involves a stomach-meridian organ but not a non-stomach-meridian organ such as the liver. How can we explain the phenomena of EA and meridian effect? Here, we proposed a neurovascular transmission model for acupuncture induced NO. In this proposed model, the acupuncture stimulus is able to influence connective tissue via mechanical force transfer to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through the ECM, the mechanotransduction stimulus can be translated or travel from the acupuncture points, which involve local tissue and cells. Cells in the local tissue that have received mechanotransduction induce different types of NO production that can induce changes in blood flow and local circulation. The local mechanical stress produced is coupled to a cyclic strain of the blood vessels and this could then change the frequency of resonance. According to the resonance theory, an oscillatory pattern of NO formation might occur in that specific organ. Therefore, the artery tree would then change the blood distribution and microcirculation of various organs and as a result further affect the production of NO. "
"Background Smoking is reported to increase arterial stiffness. Indices obtained from the second derivative of digital volume pulse (SDDVP) waveform have been proposed to characterize vascular aging and arterial rigidity. PC6 (Neiguan) is a traditional acupoint in each forearm that has been shown to modify cardiovascular functioning. Objective To investigate the acute effects of manual needling with PC6 on SDDVP indices in healthy chronic smoker and nonsmoker subjects. Subjects and Methods Aging index (AI) was defined as (b – c – d – e)/a, B:A was calculated as the ratio of the absolute value for the height of the b wave (B) to that of the a wave (A), and D:A was calculated as the ratio of the absolute value for the height of the d wave (D) to that of the a wave (A). These indices derived of the wave components of SDDVP of healthy nonsmokers (n=40; 28.3±3.0 years old) vs. chronic smokers (n=30; 29.9±2.9 years old) were compared. The digital volume pulse (DVP) was obtained by measuring infrared light transmission through the finger. Of each subject, a DVP registration 20 minutes long was obtained. PC6 was stimulated unilaterally by manual needling for 5 minutes (1–6 minutes). SDDVP indices were compared in each subject in pre- vs. post-acupuncture periods (30 seconds vs. 18 minutes, respectively). b – c – d – e a b a d a n vs. n vs. vs. b – c – d – e a b a d a n vs. n vs. vs. Results At baseline, we found significant difference in B:A between nonsmokers and smokers. Comparing pre- vs. post-acupuncture periods, B:A and D:A did not show significant differences among nonsmokers, but B:A improved significantly in smokers and AI improved significantly in both nonsmokers and smokers. vs. vs. Conclusion These findings suggest that manual needling with PC6 could revert some of the deleterious effects on vascular functioning produced by chronic cigarette smoking.

"A hydro-mechanic model was put forward to study the fundamental nature of acupuncture meridians. The basic state of low hydraulic resistance was tested on humans and mini pigs using three methods. The first, a modified Guyton's method, proved that there was lower hydraulic resistance on meridians compared with nonmeridians. The second scanning method involved a single pressure transducer that can find the lowest resistance point in tissue, and the third method used two transducers and provided a more stable measurement. Using the latter method, low hydraulic resistance points were found very close to low impedance points along meridians. The transmission of artificial interstitial fluid pressure waves was measured to examine their connection to the low resistance points, with the result that a good connection between the points was confirmed. This means the points form channels along the meridians that we refer to as low hydraulic resistance channels. The channel was imaged through isotopic tracing and a migration of isotope 99mTe could be found along the channel. The layer of the channel was detected by injecting Alcian blue and the track was found beneath the skin. All of the above experiments suggest the existence of a new type of channel in living tissues that has not yet been described in modern science, but coincides quite well with the Qi channel theory of traditional Chinese medicine. 99m 99m "
"This narrative review examines the psychosocial factors that might predict clinical outcomes in acupuncture for pain. Given existing evidence concerning the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in painful conditions, it is important to consider how clinicians might further improve their effectiveness. The relevant theoretical frameworks focus primarily on the patient, suggesting that their background characteristics and their beliefs about pain and acupuncture should be considered as potential predictors of outcome. The self-regulation model within health psychology helps us understand how people manage their health and integrate interventions like acupuncture into the management of their illness. This model also implies that the therapeutic relationship, in particular patients' perceptions of that relationship, is likely to be related to outcome. The empirical literature in this area is sparse. However, the findings to date do suggest that a number of psychosocial factors, in particular patients' beliefs about acupuncture, are significant predictors of treatment outcomes from acupuncture for pain. Factors related to the therapeutic relationship are also likely to be important in facilitating good clinical outcomes. We discuss the limitations of the existing studies and make recommendations for future research in this area. If we can better understand the psychosocial factors involved in acupuncture, then we should be able to enhance acupuncture treatments and improve outcomes for patients. These observations will, therefore, have potential to allow us to develop techniques that may improve clinical outcomes in the treatment of pain. "
"Novel threadlike structures of 20 to 40 μm in diameter were observed running afloat in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain ventricles and the spinal central canal of a rabbit. We developed an effective in situ staining technique using hematoxylin to visualize the threadlike structure. The presence of the rod-shaped nuclei in the threadlike structure was confirmed by various nucleus specific staining dyes such as 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, propidium iodide and yoyo-1. The threadlike structure was surrounded by a cellular membrane, whose presence was visualized by using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate staining. The location, diameter, optical transparency and the presence of rod-shaped nuclei in and the surrounding membranes of the threadlike structure were consistent with a nerve Bonghan duct. The Bonghan duct was claimed to be the extension of the physical substance of acupuncture meridians and to be a distinct type of circulatory system present in mammals. Although Bonghan theory has not been reproduced for a long time, recently, some portions of the Bonghan duct network were confirmed in various organs in mammals including blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and enteric organs. The novel threadlike structure in the central nervous system, more specifically in brain ventricles, is one in a series of findings in an attempt to rediscover the Bonghan duct network. in situ in situ "
"Using a mixed-dye injection technique, we found a novel kind of muscle fiber with a lumen, established its precise location in the subcutaneous muscle layer along the acupuncture muscle of the bladder line, and determined its detailed ultrastructure. The channels with flowing liquid were a novel kind of muscle fibers with lumens and they were located in the subcutaneous muscle layer of rat. Their detection was realized by using chrome-hematoxylin and a mixture of fluorescent nanoparticles and commercial Pelikan ink. These acupuncture muscle channels were hidden among the neighboring skin skeletal muscle fibers and were barely distinguishable from them with light microscopes. Only with a transmission electron microscope were their characteristic features shown to be different from normal skin skeletal muscle. These features included undifferentiated muscle fibers that resembled immature myofibrils without Z-lines and reassembled telophase nuclei. "
"The main goal of geriatric rehabilitation reconditioning following an acute illness is rapid restoration of normal activity. Key elements are pain control, restoration of bowel function, sleep, appetite and general well being, alongside physical activity. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the effect of acupuncture as an adjunct to medical and physical rehabilitation in geriatric patients. The setting was a university-affiliated large city general hospital. The participants comprised 27 consenting consecutive patients in a subacute geriatric rehabilitation department. The interventions consisted of biweekly acupuncture treatment in conjunction with medical and physical therapy. The outcome measures of pain, appetite, quality of sleep, bowel function and general well being were assessed using a 10-point Likert scale at the onset and close of treatment. The results showed that a significant post-treatment improvement was seen in pain (p=0.005), appetite (p=0.0034), bowel function (p=0.029) and general well being (p=0.0012) scores in patients' treatment when compared with pretreatment baseline scores. The “quality of sleep” score showed a trend towards improvement (p=0.073). In conclusion, acupuncture may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment in geriatric postacute illness rehabilitation. Randomized controlled trials are needed to further assess the role of acupuncture as part of treatment management for restoring normal physical activity in geriatric patients."
"Background Potentization, consisting of serial dilution and succussion, is a key step in the manufacture of homeopathic medicines. Originally prescribed as a manual process, several attempts at mechanization have been published, patented and even commercialised in order to remove the human element and introduce reproducibility without drudgery. Various machines have been used over the years to prepare homeopathic medicines. Although these machines follow the same principles, i.e. energetically mixing the medicines and diluting them significantly, their mode of operation is different from each other. Methods This review paper surveys the main methods of preparation of homeopathic medicines. The main machines discussed are: Boericke's potentizer, Tyler Kent's instrument, John Alphonse's machine and the fluxion potentizer, which were used in the past, as well as more recent potentizers like arm-and-weight instruments, the K-Tronic potentizer and Quinn's machine. We review the construction and operating principle of each of these machines, along with their advantages and limitations. A scheme for relative performance assessment of these machines is proposed based on the parameters mechanical efficiency, physico-chemical efficiency, turbulence generation, energy dissipation, and accuracy of dilution. Results Quinn's machine and the arm-and-weight potentizer perform well for generating turbulence due to high impaction forces, while John Alphonse's machine is much more accurate in diluting the homeopathic medicines at every step. Conclusions Both the commercial potentizers, Quinn's machine and the K-Tronic potentizer, are completely automated and therefore reduce the manual labour and variation in succussive forces during each step, which may produce uniformity in physico-chemical changes within the resulting homeopathic medicines.

"Objectives To examine if HIV nosode in 30c dilution (HIV 30c) has therapeutic potential against lung cancer cells (A549) as compared to WRL-68 normal cells and to elucidate its possible molecular mechanism of action on DNA replication and apoptosis. Methods Effects of HIV 30c were thoroughly tested for its possible anticancer potential on A549 cells (lung cancer); WRL-68 normal liver cells served as control. Three doses, one at LD50 and two below LD-50, were used. Proliferation, migration and senescence assays were made and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) studied by routine techniques. The ability of HIV 30c to induce apoptosis in A549 cells and its possible signalling pathway were determined using immunoblots of relevant signal proteins and confocal microscopy, including studies on telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and topoisomerase II (Top II) activities, intimately associated with cell division and DNA replication. Results HIV 30c prevented cancer cell proliferation and migration, induced pre-mature senescence, enhanced pro-apoptotic signal proteins like p53, bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and inhibited anti-apoptotic signal proteins Bcl2, TERT and Top II, changed mitochondrial membrane potential and caused externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Thus, it induced apoptosis as also evidenced from increase in cells with distorted membrane morphology, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and ROS, typical of apoptosis in progress. Conclusion HIV 30c nosode has therapeutic potential for inducing cytotoxic effects on A549 cells as manifested by changes in nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, ROS generation and MMP, and for its inhibitory action on cell proliferation, cell migration, expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase and Top II genes, and increasing expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

"Background Host immunity plays an important role in prevention of disease as is evident by the increased incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) in immuno-compromised population of HIV infected, diabetes inflicted, immune-suppressant therapy and elderly people. Rising incidence of antibiotic resistance has led to resurgence of TB of epidemic proportions. Integrated treatment with add on homeopathy in addition to anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) appears to improve outcome in TB. The intervention has been integrated treatment with homeopathy regime, which is using a patient specific, disease specific and supportive medicine simultaneously, all individualized for the patient and the disease. Cases: Case 1 Pott's spine with paravertebral abscess, not responding to ATT. Addition of homeopathy led to fall in temperature, improved appetite, increase in weight and reduction of abscess. Case 2 Recurrent sub-acute intestinal obstruction. The patient could not tolerate ATT but responded to homeopathy by reduction of abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, loose stools and queasiness. Case 3 Pulmonary TB, treated with both ATT and homeopathy from beginning, led to rapid recovery and shortened treatment time. Conclusion The addition of homeopathy to ATT is patient friendly, cost effective and appears to reduces the duration of treatment. Its role as immuno-modulatory therapy should be evaluated and explored. "
"Background NMR proton relaxation is sensitive to the dynamics of the water molecule H2O, through the interaction of the spin of the proton (1H) with external magnetic and electromagnetic fields. 2 1 2 1 Methods We measured dilution and potentization processes through measurements of 1H spin-lattice T1 and spin–spin T2 relaxation times. In order to interpret the recorded fluctuations in T1- or T2-values, experimental data were linearized by investigating how the area under a fluctuating time = f(dilution) curve (dilution integral or DI) changes with dilution. Two kinds of fitting procedures were considered: chi-square fitting with a goodness-of-fit probability, and least absolute deviations criterion with Pearson's linear correlation coefficient. Results We showed that fluctuations are not attributable to random noise and/or experimental errors, evidencing a memory effect quantifiable by the slope of the DI = f(dilution) straight line. For all experiments, correlation coefficients were found to lie above 0.9999, against 0.999 for random noise. The discrimination between experimental slopes and slopes associated with random noise data was very good at a five-sigma level of confidence (i.e. probability 3 × 10−7). Discrimination between experimental slopes at a five-sigma level was possible in most cases, with three exceptions: gelsemium aqua pura v gelsemium dilution (four-sigma); copper aqua pura v gelsemium aqua pura (four-sigma) and copper simple dilution v gelsemium simple dilution (three-sigma). All potentized samples show very good discrimination (at least nine-sigma level) against aqua pura, lactose or simple dilution. It was possible to transform the associated relaxation times into a molecular rotational correlation time τc and an average spin–spin distance d. Our experiments thus point to a considerable slowing down of molecular movements (τc > 1300 ps or T = 224–225 K) around water molecules up to a distance of 3.7 Å, values. It was also possible to rule out other possible mechanisms of relaxation (diffusive motion, 17O-1H relaxation or coupling with the electronic spin, S = 1, of dissolved dioxygen molecules). −7 c c 17 1 −7 c c 17 1 Conclusion There is clear evidence that homeopathic solutions cannot be considered as pure water as commonly assumed. Instead, we have evidenced a clear memory effect upon dilution/potentization of a substance (water, lactose, copper, gelsemium) reflected by different rotational correlation times and average H⋯H distances. A possible explanation for such a memory effect may lie in the formation of mesoscopic water structures around nanoparticles and/or nanobubbles mediated by zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field as suggested by quantum field theories. The existence of an Avogadro's ‘wall’ for homeopathically-prepared medicines is not supported by our data. Rather it appears that all dilutions have a specific material configuration determined by the potentized substance, also by the chemical nature of the containers, and dissolved gases and the electromagnetic environment. This sensitivity of homeopathically-prepared medicines to electromagnetic fields may be amplified by the highly non-linear processing routinely applied in the preparation of homeopathic medicines. Future work is needed in such directions. The time is now ripe for a demystification of the preparation of homeopathic remedies. "
"Background The comprehensive systematic review of randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) in homeopathy requires examination of a study's model validity of homeopathic treatment (MVHT) as well as its risk of bias (extent of reliable evidence). Objective To appraise MVHT in those RCTs of non-individualised homeopathy that an associated investigation had judged as ‘not at high risk of bias’. Design Systematic review. Methods An assessment of MVHT was ascribed to each of 26 eligible RCTs. Another 49 RCTs were ineligible due to their high risk of bias. Main outcome measures MVHT and the prior risk of bias rating per trial were merged to obtain a single overall quality designation (‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’), based on the GRADE principle of downgrading. GRADE GRADE Results The trials were rated as ‘acceptable MVHT’ (N = 9), ‘uncertain MVHT’ (N = 10) and ‘inadequate MVHT’ (N = 7); and, previously, as ‘reliable evidence’ (N = 3) and ‘non-reliable evidence’ (N = 23). The 26 trials were designated overall as: ‘high quality’ (N = 1); ‘moderate quality’ (N = 18); ‘low quality’ (N = 7). Conclusion Of the 26 RCTs of non-individualised homeopathy that were judged ‘not at high risk of bias’, nine have been rated ‘acceptable MVHT’. One of those nine studies was designated ‘high quality’ overall (‘acceptable MVHT’ and ‘reliable evidence’), and is thus currently the only reported RCT that represents best therapeutic practice as well as unbiased evidence in non-individualised homeopathy. As well as minimising risk of bias, new RCTs in this area must aim to maximise MVHT and clarity of reporting. "
"Medicine underwent a major crisis in the 18th century and several approaches, including homeopathy, were formulated to fill the void left by the fall of traditional Galenic medicine. While most of the literature deals with the reasons doctors had to shift to homeopathy, the patients' views became the focus of increasing scholarly attention along the past 20 years. In this article I present and discuss the current knowledge about the socio-demographic characteristics and medical complaints of patients who sought homeopathic care in the early 19th century in both private and institutional settings. The results show that not only patients from the higher and more educated classes sought homeopathic care, but a considerable number of individuals from the middle and lower strata did so too, even though they also had access to conventional hospitals. As to the clinical complaints, the reasons to seek homeopathic care were the typical ones for any general practice or hospital in the period considered. "
"Background A series of different experimental approaches was applied in Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) samples and lactose controls. Experiments were designed to elucidate the effect of zinc trituration and dynamization on physicochemical properties of homeopathic formulations, using lactose as excipient. Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) Methods Zinc met. potencies (Zinc met 1–3c) were triturated and dynamized using lactose as excipient, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Lactose samples (LAC 1–3c) were also prepared following the same protocol and used as controls. The samples were analyzed structurally by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and thermodynamically by Thermogravimetry (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Zinc met. Zinc met Zinc met. Zinc met Results AAS analysis detected 97.0 % of zinc in the raw material, 0.75 % (Zinc met 1c) and 0.02% (Zinc met 2c). XRD analysis showed that inter-atomic crystalline spacing of lactose was not modified by dynamization. Amorphous and crystalline lactose spheres and particles, respectively, were observed by TEM in all samples, with mean size from 200 to 800 nm. EDX obtained with TEM identified zinc presence throughout the amorphous matter but individualized zinc particles were not observed. SEM images obtained from dynamized samples (LAC 1c and Zinc met 1c) with electron backscattering could not identify zinc metal grains. The dynamization process induced Derivatives of Thermal Gravimetric (DTg) peak modification, which was previously centered near 158°C to lactose, to a range from 140 to 170°C, suggesting the dynamization process modifies the temperature range of water aggregation. Thermal phenomena were analyzed and visualized by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistics. Both indicated that fusion enthalpy of dynamized samples (DynLAC 1-3c; DynZn 1-3c) increased 30.68 J/g in comparison to non-dynamized lactose (LAC; p < 0.05). Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Conclusions Our results suggested no structural changes due to the trituration and dynamization process. However, TG and DSC analyses permit the differentiation of dynamized and non-dynamized groups, suggesting the dynamization process induced a significant increase in the degradation heat. These results call for further calorimetric studies with other homeopathic dilutions and other methodologies, to better understand the dynamics of these systems. "
"Prognostic factor research is important as it helps in refining diagnosis, taking clinical and therapeutic decisions, enhances the design and analysis of intervention trials and helps to identify targets for new interventions that aim to modify the course of a disease. Prognostic factor research in homeopathy can be done by applying Bayes' theorem. This paper considers Bayes' theorem; Likelihood Ratio, conditional probability and research in subpopulations of a condition with examples. We analysed the likelihood ratios for 11 homeopathic medicines for the symptom ‘cough’ and other upper respiratory tract symptoms, based on data from the IIPCOS2 study. This yielded useful information since several medicines, including Belladonna, had LR >1 for cough, indicating that cough is not an indication for this medicine. The implications for improving homeopathic prescribing are discussed. Belladonna Belladonna "
"Background High-potency homeopathic remedies, 30c and 200c have enormous dilution factors of 1060 and 10400 respectively. Therefore, the presence of physical entities in them is inconceivable. As a result, their efficacy is highly debated and often dismissed as a placebo. Despite several hypotheses postulated to explain the claimed homeopathic efficacy, none have satisfactorily answered the qualms of the sceptics. Against all beliefs and principles of conventional dilution, we have shown that nanoparticles (NPs) of the starting metals are unequivocally found in the 30c and 200c remedies at concentrations of a few pg/ml. In this paper, our aim was to answer the important question of whether such negligible metal concentrations elicit a biological response. 60 400 60 400 Methods Metal-based homeopathic medicines (30c and 200c) were analysed at doses between 0.003%v/v and 10%v/v in in-vitro HepG2 cell-line. Upon treatment, cell response was estimated by MTT assay, FACS and total intracellular protein. Experiments were performed to discern whether the hormesis was a cell-activation or a proliferation effect. in-vitro in-vitro Results Remedies at doses containing a few femtograms/ml levels of the starting metals induced a proliferation-independent hormetic activation by increasing the intracellular protein synthesis. The metal concentrations (at fg/ml) were a billion-fold lower than the studies with synthetic NPs (at μg/ml). Further, we also highlight a few plausible mechanisms initiating a hormetic response at a billion-fold lower dose. Conclusions Hormetic activation has been shown for the first time with standard homeopathic high-potency remedies. These findings should have a profound effect in understanding these extreme dilutions from a biological perspective. "
"Cavitation in agitated liquids has been discussed for over five decades as a phenomenon that could play a role in the appearance of structural changes in the solvent of potentised dilutions. However, its lack of specificity as well as the absence of experimental confirmation have so far confined the idea to theory. The light emission associated with cavitational bubble collapse can be used to detect and study cavitation in fluids. The phenomenon has been extensively studied when driven by ultrasound, where it is called sonoluminescence. Sonoluminescence spectra reflect extremely high temperature and pressure in the collapsing bubbles and are parameter sensitive. This article tries to examine whether, despite objections and difficulties, the detection or the study of cavitational luminescence in solutions during potentisation could be useful as a physical tool in high dilution research.

"Background A previous study reported a significant statistical interaction between experiment date and treatment effect of Argentum nitricum 14x–30x on the growth rate of duckweed (Lemna gibba L.). The aim of the present study was to investigate the stability of the test system and intra-laboratory reproducibility of the effects found. Argentum nitricum Lemna gibba Argentum nitricum Lemna gibba Methods Duckweed was treated with A. nitricum potencies (14x–30x) as well as succussed and unsuccussed water controls. The outcome parameter area-related growth rate for day 0–7 was determined by a computerised image analysis system in two series of independent randomised and blinded experiments. Systematic negative control (SNC) experiments were carried out to investigate test system stability. Statistical analysis was performed with full two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and protected Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. A. nitricum A. nitricum Results In the first repetition series we found a significant treatment effect (p = 0.016), while in the second series no effect was observed. The negative control experiments showed that the experimental system was stable. An a posteriori subgroup analysis concerning gibbosity revealed the importance of this growth state of L. gibba for successful reproduction of the statistically significant interaction in the original study; flat: no interaction (p = 0.762); slight gibbosity: no interaction (p = 0.356); medium gibbosity: significant interaction (p = 0.031), high gibbosity: highly significant interaction (p = 0.005). a posteriori L. gibba a posteriori L. gibba Conclusions With the original study design (disregarding gibbosity status of L. gibba) results of the original study could not be reproduced sensu stricto. We conclude that the growth state gibbosity is crucial for successful reproduction of the original study. Different physiological states of the test organisms used for bioassays for homeopathic basic research must carefully be considered. L. gibba sensu stricto. L. gibba sensu stricto. "
"Objective This study investigated the effect of two different follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparations (diluted/dynamised and diluted) on the in vitro development and steroid production (estradiol, progesterone and testosterone) of isolated porcine preantral follicle after in vitro culture. in vitro in vitro in vitro in vitro Methods Secondary follicles were cultured in Alpha Minimum Essential Medium (α-MEM+) supplemented with grain ethanol (AL – 0.2%, v/v), diluted/dynamised FSH (rFSH 6cH – 0.05 fg/mL) or diluted-only FSH (1.5 ng/mL) for 4 days. Follicle development was evaluated on the basis of follicular growth, morphology and hormone production. + + Results The percentage of follicular integrity and extrusion were not affected by the treatments after culture. For all treatments, follicular diameter increased significantly from Day 0 to Day 4. On Day 2 of culture, the estradiol production was significantly higher in AL and diluted-only FSH treatments compared with diluted/dynamised FSH. However, diluted/dynamised FSH showed a significantly higher progesterone production on Day 2. Only on Day 4, the testosterone production was higher in the AL than diluted-only FSH treatments, but similar to diluted/dynamised FSH treatment. Except for diluted/dynamised FSH treatment, progesterone production increased (P < 0.05) from Day 2 to Day 4; only for AL treatment, a significant increase of testosterone production was observed during culture. Conclusion Compared to control the diluted/dynamised FSH addition increased progesterone production but decreased the estradiol production after in vitro culture of isolated porcine preantral follicles. Taken together the results suggest that at least for progesterone production the mechanism of action of diluted/dynamised FSH differs from its vehicle. in vitro in vitro "
"Introduction Alternative and complementary therapy systems, such as homeopathy, have long been used around the world. Since 1995 homeopathy has been officially recognized in Europe as a system of medicine or a medical specialty. Portuguese community pharmacists have long-standing experience with homeopathic products. By contrast, healthcare professionals in Turkey are less experienced with homeopathic practice although there is a new regulatory setting in place. There are a limited number of studies addressing pharmacists' role within the homeopathic system. Aim To investigate the attitudes (knowledge, feelings and behaviour) of experienced Portuguese pharmacy practitioners who deal with homeopathy, and thus to inform Turkish pharmacy practice and policy on homeopathy-related success factors. Methods A qualitative cross-sectional design was followed, using semi-structured and face-to-face individual interviews with purposively selected Portuguese pharmacists experienced with homeopathic medicines. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and the transcriptions imported into QSR NVivo v10 software for qualitative coding and analysis. Using a thematic content approach, the extracted codes were grouped and indexed by recurrent themes through a reflective procedure and constant comparison. Results & discussion Six general themes emerged, the most relevant being participants' feelings of gratitude for the ability to work in homeopathy; other themes were a helpful regulatory body, clear practice boundaries, scientific support and product quality assurance. Specialized homeopathic education was considered the most important factor for success. This was related to patients' positive perceptions and acceptance, suggesting an increase in public awareness through the pharmacy network. Conclusions Portuguese pharmacists' attitudes towards their homeopathic practices highlighted the key elements for success in a field that is usually distant from traditional pharmaceutical education and practice. The present findings provide guidance for Turkish pharmacists willing to expand their professional scope and to embrace complementary medicines. "
"Zinc is an important metal in body homeostasis. Zinc in soluble form (Zn2+) and homeopathic Zincum metallicum were tested in macrophages and astrocytes in order to investigate its potential toxic or therapeutic effects. We evaluated cell viability (WST assay), cytokine production such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and nitric oxide release by Griess reaction. The effect of zinc-depletion and high zinc pre-treatments on the cell adaptation capability was also investigated. In THP-1 macrophage cell line and in human primary macrophages, Zn2+ at sub-toxic doses (30 μM) caused stimulation of TNF-α and IL-10 with different dynamics reaching the maximum peak at the zinc concentration 100 μM, before the cell death. Highest doses (300 μM) impaired dramatically cell vitality. Similar effects on cell viability were obtained also in C6 astrocytes, where Zn2+ slightly increased the nitric oxide release only in cells activated by one of the pro-inflammatory stimuli used in our cellular model (interferon gamma plus TNF-α). Zinc depletion markedly reduced IL-10 production and cell viability. Zincum metallicum did not cause toxicity in any cell type and showed some small stimulation in WST assay that was statistically significant in a few experimental conditions. 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ 2+ Zincum metallicum "
"Introduction Zinc is an essential trace element necessary for life. Traditional and complementary medicines use zinc-based formulations to treat different classes of diseases. Basic research on homeopathic preparations of zinc are rare and there are a few published clinical cases describing its effects on patients. The use of cell-based models in drug screening is a reliable source of evidence. Methods We sought to investigate experimental end-points using cell-based models to determine the effects of dilutions of Zincum metallicum prepared according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and melanoma B16-F10 cell lines were cultured according to standard procedures. Cells were treated with either 5c, 6c or 30c Zincum metallicum and control cells with its respective vehicle (5c, 6c, or 30c Lactose). Macrophage activation by CD54 immunolabeling and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) using DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) were detected by flow cytometry. Phagocytic capacity (endocytic index) was quantified by light microscopy. Features of melanoma cells were analyzed by colorimetric assays to determine melanin content and cell proliferation rate. All obtained data were submitted to normality test followed by statistical analysis. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Results Zincum metallicum 6c shifted high ROS-producing macrophages to a low ROS-producing phenotype. Macrophage CD54 expression was increased by Zincum metallicum 5c. No changes in endocytic index were observed. Melanoma cells were not affected by any treatment we tested. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Conclusions Differing responses and non-linearity were found on macrophages challenged with Zincum metallicum at high dilutions. No changes in melanoma cells were observed. Customised assays using target cells can be useful to investigate high-dilution effects. Other cell types and conditions should be explored.

"Aim To systematically review surveys of 12-month prevalence of homeopathy use by the general population worldwide. Methods Studies were identified via database searches to October 2015. Study quality was assessed using a six-item tool. All estimates were in the context of a survey which also reported prevalence of any complementary and alternative medicine use. Results A total of 36 surveys were included. Of these, 67% met four of six quality criteria. Twelve-month prevalence of treatment by a homeopath was reported in 24 surveys of adults (median 1.5%, range 0.2–8.2%). Estimates for children were similar to those for adults. Rates in the USA, UK, Australia and Canada all ranged from 0.2% to 2.9% and remained stable over the years surveyed (1986–2012). Twelve-month prevalence of all use of homeopathy (purchase of over-the-counter homeopathic medicines and treatment by a homeopath) was reported in 10 surveys of adults (median 3.9%, range 0.7–9.8%) while a further 11 surveys which did not define the type of homeopathy use reported similar data. Rates in the USA and Australia ranged from 1.7% to 4.4% and remained stable over the years surveyed. The highest use was reported by a survey in Switzerland where homeopathy is covered by mandatory health insurance. Conclusions This review summarises 12-month prevalence of homeopathy use from surveys conducted in eleven countries (USA, UK, Australia, Israel, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, South Korea, Japan and Singapore). Each year a small but significant percentage of these general populations use homeopathy. This includes visits to homeopaths as well as purchase of over-the-counter homeopathic medicines. "
"In the present study, we investigated the experimental basis for the indications of homeopathic drug Zincum metallicum. The current body of knowledge about Zinc met has a core composed of pathogenetic and clinical data collected in the 19th century surrounded by layers of clinical observations reported over time. In the description, we prioritized poorly known sources, especially the ones that were never translated from the original German. We also performed quantitative and statistical analysis of repertory data. Through a literature survey and a call to practicing homeopathic doctors from many countries, we were able to put together a relevant case-series that represents homeopathic indications of Zinc.

"Objective Glycaemic goals are not achieved in most patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially in those with long disease duration and taking multiple oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD). We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of individualized homeopathic treatment in glycaemic control. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting At least 6 months of individualized homeopathic treatment at a private homeopathic centre in Hong Kong. Participants Twenty-seven adults aged 37–84 years were treated with individualized homeopathic remedies between 2012 and 2015. Published data on 40 T2DM patients under standard conventional treatment in Hong Kong were used as a control. Main outcome measure Change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 12-month or the last follow-up, whichever is earlier. Results Compared with the conventional treatment only group, the homeopathy group had higher baseline FPG (p = 0.044), and more patients had a long (>20 years) duration of diabetes (p = 0.006), and a history of cardiac events (p = 0.022). The mean difference in FPG in the homeopathy group was significantly greater than in the control after 12 months: −2.24 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.47 to −1.01) vs 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI: −1.72 to 2.04), p = 0.001. The mean difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also significantly greater, −1.11% (95% CI: −2.17 to −0.05) vs 0.08% (95% CI: −1.37 to 1.53), p = 0.046. Poorer baseline glycaemic control was associated with better outcome (r = −0.750, p < 0.001), but not the duration of diabetes (r = 0.058, p = 0.772). The improvement was robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Individualized homeopathic treatment was associated with better glycaemic control compared with standard conventional treatment alone. "
"In previous articles, a description of ‘unconventional’ experiments (e.g. in vitro or clinical studies based on high dilutions, ‘memory of water’ or homeopathy) using quantum-like probability was proposed. Because the mathematical formulations of quantum logic are frequently an obstacle for physicians and biologists, a modified modeling that rests on classical probability is described in the present article. This modeling is inspired from a relational interpretation of quantum physics that applies not only to microscopic objects, but also to macroscopic structures, including experimental devices and observers. In this framework, any outcome of an experiment is not an absolute property of the observed system as usually considered but is expressed relatively to an observer. A team of interacting observers is thus described from an external view point based on two principles: the outcomes of experiments are expressed relatively to each observer and the observers agree on outcomes when they interact with each other. If probability fluctuations are also taken into account, correlations between ‘expected’ and observed outcomes emerge. Moreover, quantum-like correlations are predicted in experiments with local blind design but not with centralized blind design. No assumption on ‘memory’ or other physical modification of water is necessary in the present description although such hypotheses cannot be formally discarded. in vitro In conclusion, a simple modeling of ‘unconventional’ experiments based on classical probability is now available and its predictions can be tested. The underlying concepts are sufficiently intuitive to be spread into the homeopathy community and beyond. It is hoped that this modeling will encourage new studies with optimized designs for in vitro experiments and clinical trials. in vitro in vitro in vitro "
"Introduction Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of solvatochromic dyes for investigating the physical chemistry of homeopathic potencies. Results Following examination of this class of dyes in organic solvents, results obtained using the positively solvatochromic dye Bis-dimethylaminofuchsone (BDF) in aqueous solution are now reported. Spectral changes observed with this dye in the presence of potencies are both substantial and reproducible. Studies across a wide range of pH values reveal an unusual pH dependence for the dye's interaction with homeopathic potencies. Results indicate potency enhances dye protonation at pH values below c. 7.0, whilst protecting the dye from attack by hydroxyl ions above c. pH 7.5. Conclusion A possible explanation for these observations is offered in terms of a potency – induced electron density shift in BDF. The interaction of homeopathic potencies with solvatochromic dyes, particularly BDF, points towards a possible physico-chemical model for the nature of potencies, how they may be interacting with this class of dyes, and moreover how their biological effects may be mediated.

"Background Several recent studies reported the capability of high diluted homeopathic medicines to modulate gene expression in cell cultures. In line with these studies, we examined whether ultra-high dilutions (30C and 200C) of sodium butyrate (SB) can affect the expression levels of genes involved in acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Methods Cell viability was evaluated using a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The expression levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 genes were determined by real-time PCR assay. Results Exposure to both 30C and 200C during 48 h led to a significant decrease of the level of expression of TNF-α gene, while expression of IL-2 gene was increased when exposed to 30C, and expression of IL-10 gene was decreased when exposed to 200C. No changes in expression levels of all genes studied were observed in cells treated with both 30C and 200C remedies of SB during the 24 h. Conclusion Observed changes in gene expression levels after exposure to 30C and 200C remedies of SB during 48 h suggest that extremely low concentrations of this agent can modulate the transcriptome of HEK 293 cells. These results are in line with findings from other studies confirming the ability of homeopathic remedies to modulate gene expression in cell cultures. "
"Background The popularity of homeopathy is seemingly at odds with the scientific controversy over its effectiveness. Several studies have reported on effectiveness of clinical homeopathy, but few studies have been conducted on practices and perceptions of homeopaths, and none in New Zealand (NZ). To address this gap, this paper reports findings from the first national survey examining the characteristics, perceptions and experiences of NZ-based homeopaths regarding a wide range of issues relating to their role and practice. There were 176 homeopaths in NZ at the time of this survey, who were members of a voluntary register (The New Zealand Council of Homeopaths), homeopaths are not statutorily registered in NZ. Methods A 65 question, online survey was sent to homeopathic practitioners via their professional associations. A total of 176 homeopaths were invited to participate. Of these 176, 57 (32%) responded. Results The majority of homeopaths were female (93%). Twelve percent were under 45 years and 20% over 55 years. Most (85%) had qualification in homeopathy of diploma or certificate level and most (66%) were engaged in part-time practice. Mean year of experience was 12.6 and mean caseload per month was 25. 90% considered research useful to validate practice, while 88% considered that it impacted on practice, although only 48% had skills to interpret research papers. There was an association between skills to interpret research and its impact on practice (p = 0.038). The majority (87%) were in favour of registration, with a statistically significant association between attitudes to registration and age (p = 0.027), the older homeopaths being more in favour. Most (68%) were in favour of integration with conventional practitioners and many referred to conventional practitioners (mean referrals per annum to GPs = 57 and midwives = 30). Homeopaths assessed their contribution to New Zealand Ministry of Health objectives as significant, with 77% perceiving that they improved nutrition, 75% increasing physical activity and 63% reducing smoking. Conclusion These findings enable greater understanding of the way in which homeopaths practice in New Zealand and how they perceive their role in health care. The findings potentially assist communication between homeopaths and other health professionals. There is a need to further investigate homeopaths' practices and perceptions in NZ. "
"Background Mortality from vibriosis in mollusk production is attributed to pathogenic bacteria, particularly Vibrio alginolyticus. Use of increasingly potent antibiotics has led to bacterial resistance and increased pathogenicity. Alternatives in sanitation, safety, and environmental sustainability are currently under analysis. To-date, homeopathy has been investigated in aquaculture of freshwater fish, but not in marine mollusks. The effect of the homeopathic complexes in the growth, survival, and immune response of the Catarina scallop Argopecten ventricosus were assessed. Vibrio alginolyticus Argopecten ventricosus Vibrio alginolyticus Argopecten ventricosus Methods A bioassay to assess the potential of homeopathy in improving cultivation of juvenile A. ventricosus was conducted for 21 days, with a final challenge of 120 h with V. alginolyticus. The experimental design included two homeopathic formulas The homeopathic complex Passival, consisting of Passiflora incarnata 30 CH, Valeriana officinalis 30 CH, Ignatia amara 30 CH and Zincum valerianicum 30 CH plus Phosphoricum acid 30 CH (treatment TH1) or Silicea terra 30 CH (TH2), two antibiotics (ampicillin = AMP, oxytetracycline = OXY), and two reference treatments (without homeopathic or antibiotic treatment = CTRL, ethanol 30° GL = ETH). Additionally, a negative control CTRL− (untreated/uninfected) is included in the challenge test. Juvenile scallops (4.14 ± 0.06 mm, 13.33 mg wet weight) were cultivated in 4 L tanks provided with aerated, filtered (1 μm), and UV-sterilized seawater that was changed every third day. They were fed a blend of the microalgae Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans (150,000 cells mL−1 twice a day). All treatments were directly added to the tank water and then 500 mL challenge units were inoculated with 1 × 107 CFU/mL (LD50) of V. alginolyticus. A. ventricosus V. alginolyticus Isochrysis galbana Chaetoceros calcitrans −1 7 50 V. alginolyticus A. ventricosus V. alginolyticus Isochrysis galbana Chaetoceros calcitrans −1 7 50 V. alginolyticus Results Juveniles grew significantly larger and faster in height and weight with TH2 compared to the ETH and CTRL (P < 0.05, ANOVA). Higher concentrations of proteins occurred in scallops exposed to TH2 (160.57 ± 7.79 mg g−1), compared to other treatments and reference treatments. Higher survival rate during the challenge bioassay occurred with TH1 (85%), compared to AMP (53%), OXY (30%), and CTRL (0%), and superoxide dismutase (P < 0.05) was significantly higher in scallops treated with TH1, compared to other treatments and reference treatments. P −1 P P −1 P Conclusions Homeopathic treatments improved growth and survival and enhanced survival against V. alginolyticus in juvenile A. ventricosus. This suggests that homeopathy is a viable treatment for this mollusk to reduce use of antibiotics in scallops and its progressive increase in pathogenicity in mollusk hatcheries.

"Background Climacteric is associated with both depression and metabolic dysregulation. Scarce evidence suggests that metabolic dysregulation may predict poor response to conventional antidepressants. Response to depression treatment has not been studied in homeopathic medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic disorders in depressed climacteric women treated with homeopathic medicines, fluoxetine or placebo, and if these alterations have any association with response to depression treatment. Methods One hundred and thirty-three Mexican women (40–65 years) with depression, enrolled in the HOMDEP-MENOP study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, three-arm trial with a 6 week follow-up, underwent a complete medical history and clinical examination. Metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline. Association between baseline metabolic parameters and response to depression treatment was analyzed with bivariate analysis in the three groups. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Metabolic parameters were considered for inclusion in the logistic regression model if they had a statistically significant relationship with response rate on bivariate analysis at p < 0.05 or if they were clinically relevant. Results Overall combined prevalence (obesity and overweight) was 86.5%; 52.3% had hypertriglyceridemia; 44.7% hypercholesterolemia; 46.7% insulin resistance; and 16% subclinical hypothyroidism. There was no statistically significant association between dyslipidemia, overweight, or insulin resistance and non-response in the homeopathy group [OR (95% CI) 1.57 (0.46–5.32), p = 0.467; 0.37 (0.003–1.11), p = 0.059; 0.67 (0.16–2.7), p = 0.579, respectively]. Conclusion Metabolic dysregulation was not significantly associated with response to depression treatment in depressed climacteric women treated with individualized homeopathic treatment (IHT), fluoxetine or placebo. Due to the high prevalence of metabolic disorders and its relationship with depression in the climacteric, further investigation should be focused on whether individualized prescriptions based on classical homeopathy for depressed climacteric women have an effect on metabolic parameters, and/or if treating the metabolic disorders at the same time could lead to higher response rates.

"Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate whether the number of succussion strokes applied after each dilution step when preparing the homeopathic treatments influences the effectiveness of ultra-high-diluted (UHD) arsenic trioxide at the 45th decimal dilution/dynamization (As2O3 45x). 2 3 2 3 Design Wheat seeds, previously stressed with ponderal As2O3, were treated with: As2O3 45x, H2O 45x (dynamized control), or pure water (negative control). The succussion was done manually, and various succussion durations (numbers of strokes) were tested for each treatment. Treatment effectiveness was tested blind using the in vitro germination test and the droplet evaporation method (DEM). Data were processed by the Poisson test (germination test) and by two-way analysis of variance (DEM). 2 3 2 3 2 in vitro 2 3 2 3 2 in vitro Main outcome measures We evaluated both the in vitro germination rate, by counting the non-germinated seeds, and the complexity of polycrystalline structures (PCS) (local connected fractal dimension (LCFD)) obtained by evaporating leakage droplets from stressed seeds that had been watered with the different treatments. in vitro in vitro Results We observed a highly significant increase in germination rate when the number of strokes (NS) was ≥32 for both As2O3 45x and H2O 45x, and a significant increase in the LCFD of PCS for As2O3 45x when the NS was ≥32 and for H2O 45x when it was 70.

These results indicate that succussion may have an important influence on treatment effectiveness, and so highlight the need for further research. "
"Background Resistance to antibiotics is a major public health concern worldwide. New treatment options are needed and homeopathy is one such option. We sought to assess the effect of the homeopathic medicine Belladonna (Bell) and a nosode (biotherapy) prepared from a multi-drug resistant bacterial species, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), on the same bacterium. Belladonna Staphylococcus aureus Belladonna Staphylococcus aureus Methods Bell and MRSA nosode were prepared in 6cH and 30cH potencies in 30% alcohol and sterile water, according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia and tested on MRSA National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) 10442. We assessed in vitro bacterial growth, deoxyribonuclease (DNAase) and hemolysin activity, and in vitro bacterial growth in combination with oxacillin (minimum inhibitory concentration – MIC). All values were compared to control: 30% alcohol and water. Bell in vitro in vitro Bell in vitro in vitro Results In vitro growth of MRSA was statistically significantly inhibited in the presence of Bell and nosode 6cH and 30cH compared to controls (p < 0.0001); and with combination of Bell or nosode 6cH and 30cH and oxacillin (p < 0.001). Bell 30cH and nosode 6cH and 30cH significantly decreased bacterial DNAse production (p < 0.001) and reduced red blood cell lysis. In vitro Bell Bell Bell In vitro Bell Bell Bell Conclusions Cultures of MRSA treated with Belladonna or MRSA nosode exhibited reduced growth in vitro, reduced enzymatic activity and became more vulnerable to the action of the antibiotic oxacillin. Further studies are needed on the biomolecular basis of these effects. Belladonna in vitro Belladonna in vitro "
"Background & aims The motivations of patients who consult a homeopathic (GP-Ho) or conventional (GP-CM) general practitioner for supportive care during cancer treatment have not been widely studied. We investigated the reasons why cancer patients consult a GP-Ho versus a GP-CM for supportive care and the GPs' motivations for their prescriptions. versus versus Methods This observational survey was carried out in France between October 2008 and October 2011. GPs across France were randomly selected and asked to recruit four cancer patients each. At inclusion, the sociodemographic and clinical (including psychological) characteristics and medical history of the patients were recorded by the GPs and the patients noted their quality of life (QoL) and anxiety/depression using the Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) self-questionnaires. The main motivations of the patients regarding the type of GP consultation and the main reasons for the GPs' prescriptions were recorded. Results Six hundred and forty four patients were included in the analysis: 399 consulted a GP-CM (n = 112) and 245 a GP-Ho (n = 73). Patients consulting a GP-Ho were more often female [OR = 1.93; 95%CI: 1.11–3.35; p = 0.02], employed in a professional capacity [OR = 6.57; 95%CI: 1.96–21.99; p = 0.002], have a shorter time since cancer diagnosis [OR = 2.19; 95%CI: 1.24–3.87; p = 0.007], have received targeted anticancer therapy [OR = 3.70; 95%CI: 1.67–8.18; p = 0.001] and have a high QLQ-C30 score for constipation [OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 1.00–1.02; p = 0.001]. Patients mainly consulted a GP-Ho to receive overall care (73.5% vs. 64.9%; p = 0.024) and medicines to prevent anticancer treatment-related side-effects (63.7% vs. 41.4%; p < 0.0001). In contrast, patients consulted a GP-CM to receive psychological care (50.1% vs. 40.8%; p = 0.021) and more information regarding the oncologists' strategic decisions (p < 0.0001). There was a significantly greater prescription of psychotropic drugs by GP-CM (53.7% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.0001). vs. vs. vs. vs. vs. vs. vs. vs. Conclusions Patients consulting a GP-Ho or GP-CM had different motivations for seeking supportive care. There was a significantly greater prescription of psychotropic drugs by GP-CM. "
"Background Employing the secondary action or adaptative reaction of the organism as therapeutic response, homeopathy uses the treatment by similitude (similia similibus curentur) administering to sick individuals the medicines that caused similar symptoms in healthy individuals. Such homeostatic or paradoxical reaction of the organism is scientifically explained through the rebound effect of drugs, which cause worsening of symptoms after withdrawal of several palliative treatments. Despite promoting an improvement in psoriasis at the beginning of the treatment, modern biological therapies provoke worsening of the psoriasis (rebound psoriasis) after discontinuation of drugs. similia similibus curentur similia similibus curentur Method Exploratory qualitative review of the literature on the occurrence of the rebound effect with the use of immunomodulatory drugs [T-cell modulating agents and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors drugs] in the treatment of psoriasis. Results Several researches indicate the rebound effect as the mechanism of worsening of psoriasis with the use of efalizumab causing the suspension of its marketing authorization in 2009, in view of some severe cases. Other studies also have demonstrated the occurrence of rebound psoriasis with the use of alefacept, etanercept and infliximab. Conclusion As well as studied in other classes of drugs, the rebound effect of biologic agents supports the principle of similitude (primary action of the drugs followed by secondary action and opposite of the organism).

"Background This study was initiated as part of a quality improvement audit process to create standards around goal setting with our patients to understand and improve outcomes of homeopathic treatment. Method We used the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP2) as a tool to assist clinicians in setting the treatment goals across a wide range of diagnoses and other complaints in routine clinical practice at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. The data collected from the MYMOP2 is of significance in its own right and the results are now reported in this paper. Results A total of 198 patients with a wide range of complaints attended one to five consultations with 20 homeopathic doctors. Diagnostic categories were most commonly neoplasms (16.7%), psychological (13.9%) and genitourinary complaints (12.3%), with 66.7% suffering from these problems for at least one year. The three symptoms that bothered patients the most were pain, mental symptoms and tiredness/fatigue. A paired-samples t-test using an intention-to-treat analysis showed that the MYMOP2 profile score improved from 4.25 (IQR 3.50–5.00), with a mean change of 1.24 (95% CI 1.04, 1.44) from the first to the last consultation (p < 0.001). Results were statistically significant both for completers (n = 91) (p < 0.001) and non-completers (n = 107) (p < 0.001) using last-observation-carried-forward, although completers did better than non-completers (p < 0.001). The overall clinical significance of improvements was at least moderate. A repeated measures ANOVA test also showed statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001). Conclusion The MYMOP2 results add to a growing body of observational data which demonstrates that when patients with long term conditions come under homeopathic care their presenting symptoms and wellbeing often improve. Offering a low cost high impact intervention to extend the range of choice to patients and to support self-care could be an important part of the NHS. "
"Objective To determine the possible effect of two homeopathic medicines, Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH, in the prevention of aromatase inhibitor (AI) associated joint pain and/or stiffness in women with early, hormone-receptor positive, breast cancer. Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron Methods This prospective, unrandomized observational study was carried out between April and October 2014. Women were recruited in two groups, according to which of the two study centres they attended: one receiving homeopathy in addition to standard treatment (group H) and a control group, receiving standard treatment (group C). All women were treated with an AI. In addition, women in group H also took Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH (5 granules, twice a day) up to 7 days before starting AI treatment. The homeopathic medicines were continued for 3 months. Demographic and clinical data were recorded using a self-assessment questionnaire at inclusion (T0) and 3 months (T3). Primary evaluation criteria were the evolution of scores for joint pain and stiffness, the impact of pain on sleep and analgesic consumption in the two groups after 3 months of treatment. Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron Results Forty patients (mean age 64.9 ± 8.1 years) were recruited, 20 in each group. Two-thirds of the patients had joint pain before starting AI treatment. There was a significant difference in the evolution of mean composite pain score between T0 and T3 in the two groups (−1.3 in group H vs. +3.4 in group C; p = 0.0001). The individual components of the pain score (frequency, intensity and number of sites of pain) also decreased significantly in group H. Nine patients in group C (45%) vs. 1 (5%) in group H increased their analgesic consumption between T0 and T3 (p = 0.0076). After 3 months of treatment, joint pain had a worse impact on sleep in patients in group C (35% vs. 0% of patients; p = 0.0083). The differences observed in the evolution of morning and daytime stiffness between the two groups were smaller (p = 0.053 and p = 0.33, respectively), with the exception of time necessary for the disappearance of morning stiffness which was greater in group C (37.7 ± 23.0 vs. 17.9 ± 20.1 min; p = 0.0173). Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that treatment with Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH may decrease joint pain/stiffness in breast cancer patients treated with AIs. A larger-scale randomized study is required to confirm these results. Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron Ruta graveolens Rhus toxicodendron "
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of two administration methods of a biostimulatory homeopathic complex (Convert H®) on the production of fresh and lyophilized venom of rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under intensive captivity conditions. Sixty snakes were subjected to treatment following a randomized block design. The effects of sex and size were controlled for. Thirteen consecutive extractions were performed over 21 months. The first factor considered in the experiment was the origin of mice used as prey: a conventional colony (A1) or the Convert H colony (A2; mice receiving the homeopathic complex in water at 1%). The type of water given to snakes was the second factor: pure (B1) or amended with 5% of Convert H® (B2). The experiment was structured in a factorial 2 × 2 design combining mouse and water types (A1B1, A1B2, A2B1, and A2B2). No consistent treatment effects on fresh venom production (mL) were observed when the experimental groups were compared with controls (A1B1). However, production of lyophilized venom (mg) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in A2B2 animals than in controls in eight of 13 extractions performed, and also in aggregate. The results revealed that production of lyophilized venom, measured over multiple extractions, can be increased by administering the homeopathic complex simultaneously to rattlesnakes and prey.

"Introduction Beauvais presented the application of a so-called ‘quantum-like model of homeopathy’ by introducing the idea of a type of randomization/unblinding which he called ‘in situ’. He predicted that randomized studies based on this type of randomization/unblinding lead to more pronounced effects in placebo controlled randomized homeopathic trials. We designed an experiment regarding wheat germination and stalk length to investigate Beauvais' idea of ‘in situ randomization/unblinding’ using a homeopathic dilution of sulphur (LM VI) as compared to placebo as well as to water. in situ in situ in situ in situ Aim and method The primary aim of this double-blind randomized controlled experiment was to investigate whether there are differences of ‘in situ randomization/unblinding’ vs ‘central randomization/unblinding’ with respect to the effect of a homeopathic substance compared to placebo. The secondary aim of our study was to examine possible differences between the sulphur and the placebo group in the ‘in situ’ arm regarding germination and/or stalk growth of wheat seedlings measured after a seven days exposure. Wheat was treated either with sulphur LM VI, placebo, or water. The wheat grains were placed on glass lids and treatment was performed following the ‘in situ randomization/unblinding’ as well as ‘central randomization/unblinding’ method. Germination was measured and classified into three categories. in situ in situ in situ in situ in situ in situ Results Under ‘in situ’ randomization/unblinding the odds of a seed not to germinate is 40% lower if treated with sulphur compared to placebo (p = 0.004). In contrast, these odds are practically equal in the ‘central’ meta-group (OR = 1.01, p = 0.954). Under ‘in situ’ randomization/unblinding the odds of a seed to germinate with a length ≥1 mm is practically equal if treated with sulphur or with placebo (OR = 0.96, p = 0.717). In contrast, these odds are 21% higher under sulphur compared to placebo in the ‘central’ meta-group (OR = 1.21, p = 0.062). In summary, we found a sulphur effect that is significantly different between ‘in situ’ and ‘central’ randomization/unblinding relating to all three stages of germination. in situ in situ in situ in situ in situ in situ "
"Background As a therapeutic system, homeopathy is supported by: i) similitude and experimentation in healthy individuals, ii) potentization. A challenge for researchers consists in looking for signals in water (or vehicle) to explain the storage of information in extremely high dilutions and the transfer of such information to the living systems. Anuran amphibian metamorphosis is controlled by thyroid hormones (TH), including the resorption of the tadpole tail. Apoptosis is a genetically regulated form of cell death that can be triggered by various extracellular and intracellular stimuli resulting in coordinated activation of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. Methods This study was blind and randomized. It performed in three stages: I) the identification of the most effective T3 homeopathic dilution to induce apoptotic reactions in Rana (Lithobates) catesbeianus tadpole tail explants stimulated by T3 in substantial, II) study of different controls and III) detection in explants under the action of the most effective dilution of T3, as established in Stage I. Rana (Lithobates) catesbeianus Rana (Lithobates) catesbeianus Results There was no statistically significant difference between tail macroscopic dimensions between the groups. T3 10cH decreased the expression of caspase 3/7 mRNA, in explants treated with T3 20 nM. Conclusion The present experiment is in agreement with the hypothesis that T3, at a 10cH homeopathic dilution, changes the metamorphosis molecular network. "
"Background Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes difficult-to-treat pelvic pain. Thus being, many patients seek help in complementary and alternative medicine, including homeopathy. The effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for endometriosis is controversial due to the lack of evidences in the literature. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of potentized estrogen compared to placebo in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. Methods/design The present is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a homeopathic medicine individualized according to program ‘New Homeopathic Medicines: use of modern drugs according to the principle of similitude’ (http://newhomeopathicmedicines.com). Women with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain and a set of signs and symptoms similar to the adverse events caused by estrogen were recruited at the Endometriosis Unit of Division of Clinical Gynecology, Clinical Hospital, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo (Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo – HCFMUSP). The participants were selected based on the analysis of their medical records and the application of self-report structured questionnaires. A total of 50 women meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to receive potentized estrogen or placebo. The primary clinical outcome measure will be severity of chronic pelvic pain. Statistical analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches comparing the effect of the homeopathic medicine versus placebo after 24 weeks of intervention. http://newhomeopathicmedicines.com http://newhomeopathicmedicines.com Discussion The present study was approved by the research ethics committee of HCFMUSP and the results are expected in 2016.

"Background Gestures play an important role in medical communication. Methods 94 homeopaths (Mean age 49.6 years, 20% male) completed a 20-item questionnaire on utilization and relevance of gestures in patients' symptom description. Results After excluding nine items due to low validity (n = 4) or low item total correlation (n = 5), factor analysis of the questionnaire resulted in the following three dimensions explaining 66.6% of variance: ‘Hand gestures in relation to verbal expressions’ (5 items; Cronbach's α = 0.81), ‘Hand Gestures describing the experience of bodily and mental symptoms’ (4 items; Cronbach's α = 0.74) and ‘practitioners' behavior and active attitude in observing hand gestures’ (2 items; Cronbach's α = 0.86). Conclusion The survey shows how homeopathic therapists view patients' hand gestures, whether they use these diagnostically and how this relates to their homeopathic practice. Practitioners with only homeopathic influence on this topic are highly congruent to findings on hand gestures from other domains. "
"Background CANOVA® (CA) is a homeopathic immunomodulator. It contains several homeopathic medicines prepares according to the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia. CA is indicated in clinical conditions in which the immune system is impaired and against tumors. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU) is an N-nitroso compound, with genotoxic/mutagenic properties. Although several studies have shown promising results in the use of CA, there are no studies reporting possible antigenotoxic effects. ® ® Method This study evaluated the in vitro antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic effects of CA in human lymphocytes exposed to NMU. Samples of human lymphocytes that were subjected to different concentrations of a mixture containing CA and NMU were used. The genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity of CA was evaluated by the comet assay, anticytotoxicity was assessed by quantification of apoptosis and necrosis using acridine orange/ethidium bromide. in vitro in vitro Results CA significantly reduced DNA damage induced by NMU and reduced significantly the frequency of NMU-induced apoptosis after 24 h of treatment. Conclusion CA has an important cytoprotective effect significantly reducing the DNA damage and apoptosis induced by the carcinogen NMU. "
"Background Influenza affects thousands of people worldwide every year, motivating the development of new therapies. In this work, the effects of two homeopathic preparations (influenza biotherapies and thymulin) were chosen following two different rationales: isotherapy and endo-isotherapy models. The homeopathic effects were evaluated individually considering the inflammatory and behavioral responses against influenza virus antigen were studied in BALB/c mice. Methods Male adult mice were treated orally and blindly for 21 days with highly diluted influenza virus or with thymulin, and were divided in two sets of experiments. The first series of experiments aimed to describe their behavior, using an open field (OF) device. In the second series, mice were challenged subcutaneously with influenza hemagglutinin antigen (7 μg/200 μl) at day 21. At day 42, behavior and inflammation response were evaluated. Results No behavioral changes were seen in OF tests at any time point after treatments. Flow cytometry and morphometry revealed significant changes in T and B cell balance after influenza antigen challenge, varying according to treatment. Conclusion The results show that both homeopathic treatments induced subtle changes in acquired immune anti-viral response regulation. A deeper understanding of the mechanism could elucidate their possible use in influenza epidemiological situations. "
"Aim To study the outcomes of atopic diseases in children treated with homeopathy at the Homeopathic Clinic of Lucca (Italy) and related long-term results after approximately an 8-year period. Materials and methods Our data derive from an observational longitudinal study carried out on 857 pediatric patients who consecutive visited from 1998 to 2014. Children with atopic diseases were 325 (37.9%), 126 (39%) suffered from atopic dermatitis, 72 (22%) from allergic rhinitis, and 127 (39%) from asthma. Moreover, a long-term study was conducted on a subset of 107/165 patients, consecutively visited from 1998 to 2006, and with ≥5 years follow-up. The study also investigated the evolution of overall symptoms in those patients with a complex atopic symptomatology. Results 75.8% of atopic children had moderate or major improvement (67.1% with asthma as the primary disease; 84.2% rhinitis; 84.2% dermatitis). At re-evaluation after 5–10 years, complete remission of atopic symptoms was obtained in 70.1% of the children: 84.2% in dermatitis; 48.1% in allergic rhinitis; 71.4% in asthma. Children with two or three atopic diseases at the first visit were completely cured in 40% of cases. Conclusion The results seem to confirm that homeopathic medicine produces positive therapeutic response in atopic children. "
"Background Most of the nosodes in the homeopathic pharmacopeia have been sourced from obscure pathological material over a century ago; of which no scientific documentation is available. Method A method for preparation and standardization of univalent and polyvalent Mycobacterium nosodes (labeled as Emtact), using different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was developed. The committee comprising microbiologists, scientist, pharmacist, homeopaths and clinicians had reviewed and approved the method of preparation of nosode. Preparation of the nosode was based on the reference in the Homeopathy Pharmacopoeia of India (HPI), group N-IV. Strains of M. tuberculosis viz. Standard strain H37Rv, multi-drug resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG vaccine) and Mycobacterium avium were identified, procured and documented. Twenty billion viable cells for each strain were taken for Original Stock Nosode (OSN). The original stock was prepared by suspending the microbial cells into water for injection (WFI) (1 ml). As per the Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) monograph, sterility testing was done for different potencies. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed for 30c potency for detection of any DNA material of the source organisms. Mycobacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis M. tuberculosis M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium bovis Mycobacterium avium Mycobacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis M. tuberculosis M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium bovis Mycobacterium avium Result A polyvalent (multi-strain) and univalent M. tuberculosis nosodes were prepared for research and clinical use. No growth of Mycobacterium was observed in any of the samples above 5c potency. The in-vitro testing for nosode (30c) was found to be free from any organism and DNA material. M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium in-vitro M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium in-vitro Conclusion Mycobacterium nosodes sourced from individual strain and polyvalent Emtact nosode in vitro testing results found to be satisfactory for its handling and utilization. The nosode seems to be safe and may be tested further in vivo to explore its therapeutic application. Mycobacterium in vitro in vivo Mycobacterium in vitro in vivo "
"Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death. Homeopathic medicines are part of the alternative medicines that are given as a supportive therapy in breast cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity of commercially available homeopathic preparations of Terminalia chebula (TC) and evaluate their nanoparticulate nature. Terminalia chebula TC Terminalia chebula TC Methods Mother tincture (MT) and other homeopathic preparations (3X, 6C and 30C) of TC were tested for their effect on the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell growth assay was performed to analyze the effect of the different potencies on the growth kinetics of breast cancer cells. MT and 6C were evaluated for the presence of nanoparticles by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). MT 3X 6C 30C TC MT 6C MT 3X 6C 30C TC MT 6C Results MT decreased the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cells. However, the other potencies (3X, 6C and 30C) decreased the viability of only breast cancer cells without affecting the viability of the non-cancerous cells. All the potencies, MT, 3X, 6C and 30C, reduced growth kinetics of breast cancer cells, more specifically at 1:10 dilution at 24, 48 and 72 h. Under SEM, MT appeared as a mesh-like structure whereas under TEM, it showed presence of nanoclusters. On the other hand, 6C potency contained 20 nm sized nanoparticles. MT 3X 6C 30C MT 3X 6C 30C MT 6C MT 3X 6C 30C MT 3X 6C 30C MT 6C Conclusion The current study reports the anticancer activity of homeopathic preparations of TC against breast cancer and reveals their nanoparticulate nature. These preliminary results warrant further mechanistic studies at both in vitro and in vivo levels to evaluate the potential of TC as nanomedicine in breast cancer.

"Background The use of biotherapies in Trypanosoma cruzi infection can provide an understanding about effects of these highly diluted medications. Trypanosoma cruzi Trypanosoma cruzi Objectives To evaluate different treatment schemes and dynamizations of biotherapies prepared from blood trypomastigotes (buffy coat) in mice infected with T. cruzi. T. cruzi T. cruzi Methods Swiss mice infected with Y strain of T. cruzi were divided into two experiments. Experiment 1, all treated groups received biotherapy 7dH (10 μL/mL ad libitum) in different treatment schemes: TB7dH – treated 3 days before infection; TBA7dH – treated 3 days before and after infection; TBAe.d.7dH – treated 3 days before infection and every day after infection and IC – infection control. Experiment 2, all treated groups received medication in different dynamizations 3 days before and after infection (10 μL/mL ad libitum): TBA15dH – treated with biotherapy 15dH; TBA16dH – treated with biotherapy 16dH; TBA17dH – treated with biotherapy 17dH; TBAp.chords – treated with biotherapy ‘potency chords’ and IC – infection control. We evaluated parasitological and clinical parameters. T. cruzi ad libitum 7dH 7dH 7dH ad libitum 15dH 16dH 17dH p.chords T. cruzi ad libitum 7dH 7dH 7dH ad libitum 15dH 16dH 17dH p.chords Results Experiment 1 showed that different treatment schemes with biotherapy 7dH produced different effects on infection evolution. TBA7dH group had the best outcome, with lower parasitemia, higher survival, and better clinical evolution compared to IC. Experiment 2 showed that biotherapy ‘potency chords’ had effects different from the individual dynamizations that it contained (15dH, 16dH, and 17dH). Animals that had patent parasitemia had delayed emergence of parasites in blood and subsequent increase in parasitemia, but had better clinical evolution compared to IC. 7dH 7dH Conclusions The effects of T. cruzi biotherapies depend on frequency at which they are administered, dynamization, and host–parasite relationship/individual susceptibility of treated organism. Biotherapy appeared to transfer to infected organism ‘antigenic information’ related to parasite and ‘disease information’ related to molecules produced by host's immune response and contained in the buffy coat used to prepare the medication.

"Facing claims for and against the scientific status of homeopathy, one is entitled to ask: is there a scientific model for homeopathy? In this study we reconstructed the model put forward by Hahnemann. The results showed that it was essentially based on the assumption of a ‘vital force’ exclusive to living beings. While the vital force was a basic element of 18th-century science, the existence of such a sui generis force of nature was refuted with the formulation of the law of the conservation of energy by mid-19th century. As a function of that fact for homeopathic theory, we discuss the history of the rise and demise of the theory of the vital force from the last quarter of the 18th century to 1830. Finally, we call the attention to the paradigm shift biology underwent starting at the end of the 19th century as the framework for contemporary views on the functioning of living beings and consequently, of the effects of pharmacological agents on them. sui generis sui generis "
"Background and objectives Parental refusal to vaccinate is a cause of serious concern. Use of homeopathy is believed to be a relevant reason for parents to refuse to vaccinate. However, vaccination is one of the main gaps dividing between medically qualified or not homeopathic practitioners. The present study sought to investigate the attitude of homeopathic doctors towards vaccination and associated variables. Methods An international online survey was conducted with homeopathic doctors by means of an anonymous self-reported questionnaire in Portuguese or Spanish. Questions investigated sociodemographic and professional characteristics, overall opinion on vaccination and on some specific vaccines. Results A total of 512 responses were obtained, 77.5% of respondents were from Latin American countries, 16.8% from Spain, with small numbers from several other countries. About 75.6% of the respondents considered vaccination safe, effective and necessary, while 12.5% stated they would not recommend vaccination under any circumstance. The variables significantly correlated with positive attitude towards vaccination were: working in the public health system (p = 0.04) and homeopathy not the main medical activity (p = 0.005). Homeopaths from Brazil, where homeopathy is officially accredited, were more favorable to vaccination compared to respondents from countries where homeopathy has inferior status (p < 0.001). Conclusion The results show that there is no contradiction between homeopathy and primary prevention by means of vaccination. "
"Background Arnica montana is a popular traditional remedy widely used in complementary medicine, also for its wound healing properties. Despite its acknowledged action in clinical settings at various doses, the molecular aspects relating to how A. montana promotes wound healing remain to be elucidated. To fill this gap, we evaluated the whole plant extract, in a wide range of dilutions, in THP-1 human cells, differentiated into mature macrophages and into an alternative IL-4-activated phenotype involved in tissue remodelling and healing. Arnica montana A. montana Arnica montana A. montana Methods Real-time quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis was used to study the changes in the expression of a customized panel of key genes, mainly cytokines, receptors and transcription factors. Results On macrophages differentiated towards the wound healing phenotype, A. montana affected the expression of several genes. In particular CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), coding for an chief chemokine, exhibited the most consistent increase of expression, while also CXC chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2), Interleukin8 (IL8) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2) were slightly up-regulated, suggesting a positive influence of A. montana on neutrophil recruitment and on angiogenesis. MMP1, coding for a metalloproteinase capable of cleaving extracellular matrix substrates, was down-regulated. Most results showed non-linearity of the dose-effect relationship. A. montana A. montana A. montana A. montana Conclusions This exploratory study provides new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of A. montana as a promoter of healing, since some of the genes it modifies are key regulators of tissue remodelling, inflammation and chemotaxis.

"Background Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is common and can considerably reduce the quality of life of sufferers. Despite the wide everyday application and promising results with homeopathy, scientific evidence of its effectiveness for most ailments is scarce. Aim The assessment of the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in the alleviation of hay fever symptoms in a typical clinical setting. Methods We performed a clinical observational study of eight patients in the treatment of hay fever symptoms over a two-year period (2012 and 2013) using Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) self-evaluation questionnaires at baseline and again after two weeks and four weeks of homeopathic treatment. The individualized prescription – either a single remedy or multiple remedies – was based on the totality of each patient's symptoms. Results The average MYMOP scores for the eyes, nose, activity and wellbeing had improved significantly after two and four weeks of homeopathic treatment. The overall average MYMOP profile score at baseline was 3.83 (standard deviation, SD, 0.78). After 14 and 28 days of treatment the average score had fallen to 1.14 (SD, 0.36; P < 0.001) and 1.06 (SD, 0.25; P < 0.001) respectively. P P P P Conclusions Individualized homeopathic treatment was associated with significant alleviation of hay fever symptoms, enabling the reduction in use of conventional treatment. The results presented in this study can be considered as a step towards a pilot pragmatic study that would use more robust outcome measures and include a larger number of patients prescribed a single or a multiple homeopathic prescription on an individualized basis.

"Aim To evaluate the effects of Kalium causticum, Conium maculatum, and Lycopodium clavatum 13cH in mice infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Kalium causticum Conium maculatum Lycopodium clavatum Trypanosoma cruzi. Kalium causticum Conium maculatum Lycopodium clavatum Trypanosoma cruzi. Materials and methods In a blind, controlled, randomized study, 102 male Swiss mice, 8 weeks old, were inoculated with 1400 trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi and distributed into the following groups: CI (treated with 7% hydroalcoholic solution), Ca (treated with Kalium causticum 13cH), Co (treated with Conium maculatum 13cH), and Ly (treated with Lycopodium clavatum 13cH). The treatments were performed 48 h before and 48, 96, and 144 h after infection. The medication was repertorized and prepared in 13cH, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. The following parameters were evaluated: infectivity, prepatent period, parasitemia peak, total parasitemia, tissue tropism, inflammatory infiltrate, and survival. Statistical analysis was conduced considering 5% of significance. T. cruzi Kalium causticum Conium maculatum Lycopodium clavatum T. cruzi Kalium causticum Conium maculatum Lycopodium clavatum Results The prepatent period was greater in the Ly group than in the CI group (p = 0.02). The number of trypomastigotes on the 8th day after infection was lower in the Ca group than in the CI group (p < 0.05). Total parasitemia was significantly lower in the Ca, Co, and Ly groups than in the CI group. On the 12th day after infection, the Ca, Co, and Ly groups had fewer nests and amastigotes/nest in the heart than the CI group (p < 0.05). Decreases in the number of nests and amastigotes in the intestine were observed in the Ly group compared with the CI group (p < 0.05). In the liver (day 12), Ly significantly prevented the formation of inflammatory foci compared with the other groups. In skeletal muscle, Co and Ly decreased the formation of inflammatory foci compared with CI (p < 0.05). Ly afforded greater animal survival compared with CI, Ca, and Co (p < 0.05). The animals in the Co group died prematurely compared with the CI group (p = 0.03). p p p p p p p p p p p p p p Conclusions Ly with 13cH potency had significantly more benefits in the treatment of mice infected with T. cruzi, reducing the number of blood parasites, amastigote nests in tissue, and the number of amastigotes per nest and increasing animal survival.

"20 consecutively enrolled children age 5–16 with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) received treatment by a homeopath (8 consultations and individualized remedies) for one year. Ten subsequently enrolled children received similar time and attention for 4 months. The study explored optimum treatment protocols; the effectiveness, deliverability and acceptability of treatment; and the feasibility of outcome measurement and recruitment. Parents completed Conners' Parent Rating Scale, Revised Long Version (CPRS-R:L) every 4 months, from which DSMIV total scores were extracted; and Measure Your Own Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) every consultation. An interaction between time (baseline/4 months) and group (treatment/non-treatment) was found .756 F (1,28) = 9.06, p = 0.005. The intervention was associated with statistically significant improvements in treated children over the year: CPRS-R:L (t (18) = 4.529, p ≤ 0.000); MYMOP (t (18) = 6.938, p ≤ 0.000). Mean DSMIV total t scores decreased at each time point: baseline: 85 (SD 5.1); 4 months 76.2 (SD 10.9); and 12 months 71.5 (SD 12.77). Recruitment of control participants was problematic. Recruitment to treatment was feasible via ADHD support groups, charities, police support agencies and social services, not schools or NHS services. Attending appointments was problematic for some participants, but home visits did not improve uptake. The best venue was a familiar clinic. Some participants took medicines inappropriately, but generally taking homeopathic remedies was acceptable and well implemented. CPRS-R:L (80 items) was problematic for some parents. MYMOP was preferred by parents but not acceptable to stakeholders. In this small consecutive sample the intervention was associated with improvements in criminality, anger and children with a concomitant diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD. Treatment by a homeopath was associated with sustained, increasing improvements and the intervention was acceptable to participants. More methodically rigorous research is warranted. “We recommend that future research in this area uses comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial designs. We also recommend that these trials measure outcomes of relevance to stakeholder needs – the people and services who care for those with ADHD – parents, teachers and social workers and the criminal justice system”.

"Extremely dilute systems arise in homeopathy, which uses dilution factors 1060, 10400 and also higher. These amounts to potencies of 30c, 200c or more, those are far beyond Avogadro's number. There is extreme skepticism among scientists about the possibility of presence of starting materials due to these high dilutions. This has led modern scientists to believe homeopathy may be at its best a placebo effect. However, our recent studies on 30c and 200c metal based homeopathic medicines clearly revealed the presence of nanoparticles of starting metals, which were found to be retained due to the manufacturing processes involved, as published earlier.9,10 Here, we use HR-TEM and STEM techniques to study medicines arising from inorganic salts as starting materials. We show that the inorganic starting materials are present as nano-scale particles in the medicines even at 1 M potency (having a large dilution factor of 102000). Thus this study has extended our physicochemical studies of metal based medicines to inorganic based medicines, and also to higher dilution. Further, we show that the particles develop a coat of silica: these particles were seen embedded in a meso-microporous silicate layer through interfacial encapsulation. Similar silicate coatings were also seen in metal based medicines. Thus, metal and inorganic salt based homeopathic medicines retain the starting material as nanoparticles encapsulated within a silicate coating. On the basis of these studies, we propose a universal microstructural hypothesis that all types of homeopathic medicines consist of silicate coated nano-structures dispersed in the solvent. 60 400 9,10 2000 60 400 9,10 2000 "
"Background Well-documented studies of the potential effects and safety of homeopathic medicines in pregnancy are required. In this study, specific genes were studied which could serve as biomarkers for specification of three lineages to predict the safety of homeopathic remedies using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Thus, the present work was to study the effects of homeopathic remedies taken during pregnancy using ES cells as the model. Methods Mouse ES cells were exposed to 30C potency of Nux Vomica and Sepia, which are homeopathic medicines prescribed for the management of pregnancy related symptoms. Cytotoxicity studies were done using a modified Embryonic Stem cell test (EST). The expression levels of key genes and proteins were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Nux Vomica Sepia Nux Vomica Sepia Results Homeopathic treatment led to modulations in the expression of certain lineage specific genes but this difference was not significant with respect to solvent control and showed normal differentiation as demonstrated by the expression of α/β MHC and α-actinin proteins in the differentiated ES cells. Conclusions Our study for the first time has shown the feasibility of using ES cells in the developmental toxicity testing of remedies. The results suggest that they are not associated with developmental toxicity. "
"Background Polycrystalline structures formed inside evaporating droplets of different biological fluids have been shown sensitive towards various influences, including ultra high dilutions (UHDs), representing so a new approach potentially useful for basic research in homeopathy. In the present study we tested on a wheat seed model Zincum metallicum 30c efficacy versus lactose 30c and water. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Materials and methods Stressed and non-stressed wheat seeds were watered with the three treatments. Seed-leakage droplets were evaporated and the polycrystalline structures formed inside the droplet residues were analyzed for their local connected fractal dimensions (LCFDs) (measure of complexity) using the software ImageJ. ImageJ ImageJ Results We have found significant differences in LCFD values of polycrystalline structures obtained from stressed seeds following the treatments (p < 0.0001); Zincum metallicum 30c lowered the structures' complexity compared to lactose 30c and water. In non-stressed seeds no significant differences were found. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Conclusions The droplet evaporation method (DEM) might represent a potentially useful tool in basic research in homeopathy. Furthermore our results suggest a sensitization of the stressed model towards the treatment action, which is conforming to previous findings. "
"Background Assessment of the likelihood ratio (LR) of symptoms has been proposed as a rational means for detecting indicators to homeopathic medicines. Aims To investigate the prevalence and LR of symptoms commonly attributed to the homeopathic medicine Lycopodium clavatum (Lyc). Secondarily, to answer the question if experienced homeopaths could intuitively infer which the main symptoms of this medicine are. Lycopodium clavatum Lycopodium clavatum Methods The presence of 35 selected symptoms, prescribed medicines and therapeutic response were assessed retrospectively. The symptoms' prevalence in the Lyc responding population and the LR of the symptoms compared to their prevalence in the remainder of the population were calculated. Results Two hundred and two Lyc and 550 non Lyc cases (total 752) were included for analysis. Twenty-two symptoms were confirmed as pertaining to Lyc's semiology (prevalence %; LR): contemptuous (3.3; 6.7), urinary stones history (2.7; 5.4), egotism (5.6; 3.6), dictatorial (33.3; 3.4), haughty (8.7; 3.3), sleeps on abdomen (3.3; 3.3), intolerance to clothing in abdomen (12.0; 3.1), reproaches (4.0; 3.0), helplessness (24.0; 2.7), fear of failure (10.7; 2.6), irritability on waking in the morning (16.7; 2.5), constipation alternating with diarrhea (8.7; 2.5), intolerant to contradiction (59.3; 2.3), want of self confidence (30.0; 2.4), abdominal distension after eating (23.3; 2.1); ailments from anticipation (32.0; 1.9), irritability before menses (23.3; 1.8), conscientious (26.0; 1.6), desire of sweets (52.0; 1.6), desire of chocolate (16.7; 1.6), lack of vital heat (41.3; 1.3), and flatterer (1.3; ∞). Surveyed homeopaths' intuitive inferences correlated well with symptoms' prevalence but not with their LR. Conclusions Lycopodium's main symptoms are well known by homeopaths, but their knowledge correlates well with the symptoms' prevalence and not with their LR. Retrospective assessment of prevalence and LR of symptoms in good responders might be a means for better selection of symptoms for prospective studies. "
"Background Traditional birth attendants in Pakistan sometimes use a homeopathic remedy, Chamomilla for labor pain relief. Our study compares this homeopathic remedy for pain relief in labor with a commonly used parenteral analgesic in a hospital setting. No systematic study has been conducted previously to study the effect of chamomile, which may be affordable and available in community settings. Methods A double blind randomized controlled trial was carried out at Islamic International Medical College Trust. Ninety-nine normal pregnant women were randomly assigned into three groups. Each group received one of the three trial drugs; Chamomile, Pentazocine or placebo. The efficacy of labor analgesia was assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain intensity. Indicators of maternal and child health were recorded as were adverse effects of the drugs. Results Mean pain scores in the three groups were calculated and compared. The difference in mean VAS scores in Pentazocine and Chamomilla recutita group as compared with placebo was not statistically significant. No significant adverse effects were noticed in any group except slight headache and dizziness in three parturients in Pentazocine group. Chamomilla recutita Chamomilla recutita Conclusion Neither Pentazocine, or Chamomilla recutita offer substantial analgesia during labor. Chamomilla recutita Chamomilla recutita "
"Background Homeopathic remedy Rhus toxicodendron (Rhus tox) is used for several symptoms including skin irritations, rheumatic pains, mucous membrane afflictions, and typhoid type fever. Previously, we reported that Rhus tox treatment increased the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression in primary cultured mouse chondrocytes. Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox COX-2 Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox COX-2 Methods A preosteoblastic mouse cell line, MC3T3-e1, was treated with different homeopathic dilutions of Rhus tox and the COX-2 mRNA and protein expression was examined using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) generation was examined in LPS-induced MC3T3-e1 cells using a Griess reaction assay. Rhus tox COX-2 Rhus tox COX-2 Results Stimulation with different concentrations of Rhus tox increased the expression of Cox2 mRNA, with 30X Rhus tox showing the most prominent increase in mRNA expression. In addition, treatment with 30X Rhus tox significantly increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release compared with other homeopathic dilutions. However, the COX-2 protein expression level differed slightly from its mRNA expression, because the 30C Rhus tox treatment increased COX-2 protein to a greater extent compared with other dilutions. NO generation was dramatically decreased in MC3T3-e1 cells after Rhus tox treatment co-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Rhus tox Cox2 Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Cox2 Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Conclusion Homeopathic dilution of Rhus tox has a dual activity that increases COX-2 expression and decreases NO generation, thus modulating inflammation. Further study is needed to examine the cellular signaling mechanisms that are associated with inflammatory regulation by Rhus tox treatment in greater detail. Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox "
"Background Standardization and quality control of homeopathic drugs is very challenging. As mother tinctures are derived from complex natural resources, there is a need of systematic evaluation of chemical markers which correlate with the proposed biological activities of mother tinctures. Methods In present study, High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) standardization method of homeopathic mother tinctures of Toxicodendron pubescens using quercitrin and rutin as chemical markers is validated and correlations of content of these markers with its anti-inflammatory effects are established. Toxicodendron pubescens For HPTLC analysis, precoated silica gel plates were used as stationary phase. Two flavonoids, namely quercitrin and rutin were used as markers. Separation was achieved using methylene chloride:methanol:water:glacial acetic acid (15:1.5:1:8 v/v/v) as mobile phase. The developed plates were scanned at 365 nm. Toxicodendron pubescens Results It was observed that quercitrin (Rf value 0.63) and Rutin (Rf value 0.41) are well resolved. The minimum detectable concentrations for quercitrin and rutin were 5 ng/spot. The linearity range was between 100 and 2000 ng/spot for both the markers. Subsequently, anti-inflammatory activity of these formulations was determined against carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats, pain threshold determined by electronic Von-Frey apparatus and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) on hot-plate. All the tested formulations of Rhus Tox showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity against carrageenan induced paw edema in rats. Quantitative correlation between the content of markers and anti-inflammatory activity of mother tinctures was established. Results: Anti-inflammatory effect as well as effect on paw withdrawal and pain threshold, at third hour after carrageenan injection, correlated with quercitrin and rutin content in the respective formulations. Rhus Tox Rhus Tox Conclusions This study validates a quantitative HPTLC method for standardization of homeopathic mother tincture of Rhus Tox and establishes quercitrin and rutin as markers corresponding its biological activity. Contents of quercitrin and rutin in T. pubescens mother tincture correlates with its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions and the validated HPTLC method can be used in standardization of homeopathic mother tincture of T. pubescens.

"Methods Ninety-six cobb race chickens were equally divided in 4 groups and randomly assigned to receive a standard treatment feed + homeopathic concentrations of Symphytum (S.) officinalis (9CH), or standard treatment feed + homeopathic concentrations of Tricalcarea (4CH), or standard treatment feed + homeopathic concentrations of Calcarea (C.) carbonica (30CH) or a placebo (the same feed but without any homeopathic compound) in order to assess the ability of the homeopathic compounds to increase the concentration of calcium hydroxyapatite in the sternal spongy bone tissue. We measured the concentration of calcium hydroxyapatite in the sternal spongy bone tissue of all chickens by means of a computed tomography (CT). Symphytum (S.) officinalis Calcarea (C.) carbonica Symphytum (S.) officinalis Calcarea (C.) carbonica Results 30%, 36% and 63% increase of sternum spongy-bone mineralization was observed after a 2 years period in the treatment groups with S. officinalis (9CH), Tricalcarea (4CH) (*P < 0.05) and C. carbonica (30CH) (***P < 0.001) respectively. S. officinalis P C. carbonica P S. officinalis P C. carbonica P Conclusion Bone mineralization is usually low in battery chickens reared in commercial poultry-sheds, creating a weakness of the whole animal supporting apparatus. Homeopathic preparations with bone-tissue tropism may improve their health quality. "
"Background Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and new targeted therapies for cancer lead to adverse effects which are often difficult to relieve using classical homeopathy. Besides diminishing the quality of life of the patient, they can force the oncologist to reduce or even to cease treatment prematurely, which represents a loss of opportunity for the patient. Faced with these recurring problems, would the use of homeopathic dilution of chemotherapy, also called hetero-isotherapy, be a suitable response for improving the tolerance of and the adherence to cancer treatment? Methods Based on experiments conducted for over 50 years by many authors, we have offered our patients, since 1998, a protocol of hetero-isotherapy chemotherapy starting the day after each cytotoxic infusion. It involves taking a daily dose of a dilution of the chemotherapy used, using the increased dilution technique from 5c to 15c. Results We observed a significant decrease in side effects, allergic reactions and late sequelae in the more than 6000 hetero-isotherapic treatments given to some 4000 patients. The better tolerance to chemotherapy and the improvement in quality of life led to an increase in treatment adherence. No interference with chemotherapy was observed. When it was necessary to prescribe another homeopathic medicine, combination with hetero-isotherapy generally improved its effectiveness. Conclusion In a large population, followed for over 15 years, we observed that hetero-isotherapics, well tolerated and easy to use, reduced the side effects of chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hormone therapy, and so improve the quality of life of patients.

"Background Following studies (a) on wheat seedlings and ultra high diluted silver nitrate, and (b) on amphibians and an ultra high diluted hormone, (c) a bio-assay on wheat and extremely diluted gibberellic acid was standardized. This assay was intended to combine the easy-to-handle aspect of (a) and biologically interesting aspects of (b). The purpose of the data analysis presented here was to investigate the influence of an extreme dilution of gibberellic acid on wheat stalk length and to determine the influence of external factors on the experimental outcome. Methods Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, Capo variety) were observed under the influence of extremely diluted gibberellic acid (10−30) prepared by stepwise dilution and agitation according to a protocol derived from homeopathy (‘G30x’). Analogously prepared water was used for control (‘W30x’). 16 experiments including 8000 + 8000 grains were performed by 9 researchers. Triticum aestivum −30 Triticum aestivum −30 Results Experiments that were performed between January and April showed inconsistent results, whereas most of the experiments performed between September and December showed shorter stalks in the G30x group. This was confirmed by correlation analysis (p < 0.01). Thus winter/spring experiments and autumn experiments were analysed separately. When all 10 autumn experiments were pooled, mean stalk lengths (mm) were 48.3 ± 21.4 for the verum group and 52.1 ± 20.4 for control (mean ± SD) at grain level (N = 5000 per group) and ±5.3 and ±5.1 respectively at dish level. In other words, verum stalk length (92.67%) was 7.33% smaller than control stalk length (100%). The effect size is small when calculation is done on the basis of grains (d = 0.18) but, due to the smaller SD at dish level, medium when done on the basis of dishes (d = 0.73). The inhibiting effect was observed by 6 of the 6 researchers who performed the autumn experiments. shorter smaller shorter smaller Conclusion The model may be useful for further research as there exists a theoretical justification due to previous studies with wheat and extremely diluted silver nitrate, as well as to previous studies with amphibians and diluted hormones, and its methods are well standardized. Data confirm the hypothesis that information can be stored in the test liquid, even at a dilution of the original substance beyond Avogadro's value; and that the wheat bio-assay is sensitive to such information.

"Organic farming principles promote the use of unconventional therapies as an alternative to chemical substances (which are limited by organic regulations), with homeopathy being the most extensive. Traditionally, Spain has had little faith in homeopathy but its use in organic farming is growing. Fifty-six Spanish organic dairy farmers were interviewed to obtain what we believe to be the first data on the use of homeopathy in organic dairy cattle in Spain. Only 32% of farms use some sort of alternative therapy (16.1% homeopathy, 10.7% phytotherapy and 5.3% using both therapies) and interestingly, a clear geographical pattern showing a higher use towards the East (similar to that in the human population) was observed. The main motivation to use homeopathy was the need to reduce chemical substances promoted by organic regulations, and the treatment of clinical mastitis being the principle reason. The number of total treatments was lower in farms using homeopathy compared with those applying allopathic therapies (0.13 and 0.54 treatments/cow/year respectively) and although the bulk SCC was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in these farms (161,826 and 111,218 cel/ml, respectively) it did not have any negative economical penalty for the farmer and milk quality was not affected complying with the required standards; on the contrary homeopathic therapies seems to be an alternative for reducing antibiotic treatments, allowing farmers to meet the organic farming principles.

"Introduction The different mechanisms: A. of the interaction between the molecular mother substance and the solvent water or ethanol B. of the storage of molecule-specific information in the solvent. C. the physiological basis of the sensitivity of the living organism towards an ultra high dilution (UHD). D. the mechanism of the interaction of the test dilution with the organism are largely unknown. Several ideas have been postulated, and experiments to test them carried out in physics and in biology. Method The authors revisited a 1994 contribution on ‘preliminary elements of a theory on UHDs’ and updated it with regard to more recent literature and research findings. Results Although the experimental basis can still be questioned in most cases, remarkable fundamental observations have been made to explain the effects of UHDs. For some topics in question, it appears that information specific properties of the diluted substance to be transferred is stored by means electromagnetic fields. The interaction between the UHD and the organism seems to be electromagnetic in nature. The transmission of information from (bio-)molecules to the UHD is of special interest. Again, electromagnetic actions and vector potential fields appear to be implicated. Conclusion The mechanisms of information storage and transfer in UHDs are far from fully understood, but progress has been made at experimental and theoretical levels. "
"This work developed over the past 40 years starting from dielectric measurements on enzymes and the subsequent finding that the measurements were affected by electric, magnetic, electromagnetic fields and quantum fields. A request for help in the diagnosis and therapy of chemically sensitive patients who had become sensitive to their electromagnetic environment came in 1982. The same symptoms could be provoked by a chemical or a frequency challenge and this led to an appreciation of the synergy between chemical and frequency environmental sensitivities. Experimental cooperation with theoretical physicist Herbert Fröhlich FRS and others led to an understanding of the physics of coherent water in living systems and a mechanism for the memory of water for coherent frequencies. In a coherent system there are interacting frequencies proportionate to any velocity the system will support, in particular the velocity of light and the velocity of coherence diffusion. Thus, there can be biological interaction between the optical, microwave and ELF spectral regions. Frequency modulation of light scattered by bio-fields and its retention in recorded images is discussed. A ‘nil-potent’ frequency can erase a frequency signature and thence affect a biological system. Homeopathy is interpreted through the biological effects of coherent frequencies derived from the frequency signature of the ‘Mother Tincture’ and developed through dilution and succussion. A homeopathic potency has a frequency signature therefore it must be able to have a biological effect. "
"Introduction This paper focuses exclusively on experimental models with ultra high dilutions (i.e. beyond 10−23) that have been submitted to replication scrutiny. It updates previous surveys, considers suggestions made by the research community and compares the state of replication in 1994 with that in 2015. −23 −23 Methods Following literature research, biochemical, immunological, botanical, cell biological and zoological studies on ultra high dilutions (potencies) were included. Reports were grouped into initial studies, laboratory-internal, multicentre and external replications. Repetition could yield either comparable, or zero, or opposite results. The null-hypothesis was that test and control groups would not be distinguishable (zero effect). initial studies laboratory-internal multicentre external comparable zero opposite initial studies laboratory-internal multicentre external comparable zero opposite Results A total of 126 studies were found. From these, 28 were initial studies. When all 98 replicative studies were considered, 70.4% (i.e. 69) reported a result comparable to that of the initial study, 20.4% (20) zero effect and 9.2% (9) an opposite result. Both for the studies until 1994 and the studies 1995–2015 the null-hypothesis (dominance of zero results) should be rejected. Furthermore, the odds of finding a comparable result are generally higher than of finding an opposite result. Although this is true for all three types of replication studies, the fraction of comparable studies diminishes from laboratory-internal (total 82.9%) to multicentre (total 75%) to external (total 48.3%), while the fraction of opposite results was 4.9%, 10.7% and 13.8%. Furthermore, it became obvious that the probability of an external replication producing comparable results is bigger for models that had already been further scrutinized by the initial researchers. comparable opposite comparable opposite comparable opposite comparable opposite Conclusions We found 28 experimental models which underwent replication. In total, 24 models were replicated with comparable results, 12 models with zero effect, and 6 models with opposite results. Five models were externally reproduced with comparable results. We encourage further replications of studies in order to learn more about the model systems used. externally externally "
"Introduction A first evaluation of fundamental research into the physics and physiology of Ultra high dilutions (UHDs) was conducted by the author in 19941. In this paper we revisit methods and theories from back then and follow their paths through their evolution and contribution to new knowledge in UHD research since then. 1 1 Method Physical methods and theories discusses in our anthology on UHD in 19941 form the basis for tracing ideas and findings along their path of further development and impact on new knowledge in UHD. 1 1 Results Experimental approaches to probe physical changes in homeopathic preparations have become more sophisticated over past two decades, so did the desire to report results to a scientific standard that is on par with those in specialist literature. The same cannot be said about underlying supporting theoretical models and simulations. Conclusion Grant challenges in science often take a more targeted and more concerted approach to formulate a research question and then look for answers. A concerted effort to focus on one hypothesized physical aspect of a well-defined homeopathic preparation may help aligning experimental methods with theoretical models and, in doing so, help to gain a deeper understanding of the whole body of insights and data produced.

"Background Since 1926, an influence of a dilution of silver nitrate (24x) on the growth of coleoptiles of wheat seedlings was described. The aim of the study discussed here is the critical proof of the reliability of a test system which has been quoted as a basic model for the research on homoeopathy for decades. Methods Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) were observed under the influence of extremely diluted silver nitrate (10−23) prepared by stepwise dilution and agitation according to a protocol derived from homeopathy (‘24x’). Analogously prepared water and/or inert water was used for control. Thirty experiments including 5000 + 5000 grains were performed by 5 researchers. Triticum aestivum −23 Triticum aestivum −23 Results Stalk lengths clearly indicate that development is enhanced by the probe silver nitrate 24x as compared to control. When the experiments 1989–1995 were pooled, means and SD for silver nitrate 24x-groups were 42.3 ± 26.9 mm and for water control groups 34.7 ± 22.2 mm. Verum stalk length was 21.9% bigger than control (100%) (p < 0.01; d = 0.31, i.e. small). For the experiments 1998–2014, means and SD were 73.7 ± 21.7 mm and 60.5 ± 20.9 mm. Verum stalk length was 21.7% bigger than control (100%) (p < 0.01; d = 0.62, i.e. medium). From the results one may hypothesize that the result is more marked in experiments showing an average mean of stalk length between ca. 50 and 90 mm in contrast to smaller or bigger mean lengths. Conclusion The previous findings were confirmed by the results. "
"Background Homeopathic drug provings or pathogenetic trials (HPTs) are the pillar of homeopathy. This review summarizes the authors' findings and interpretations derived from a series of homeopathic drug proving between 1994 and 2015. It gives an overview over a series of attempts to use modern scientific experimental methodology to answer the question, whether such HPTs produce symptoms in healthy volunteers that can be distinguished from placebo symptoms. Methods Various experimental models were used: repeated crossover trials with categorical data collection, and a single-case, randomised study. Final models use diligent qualitative data-collection in experienced volunteers. In those, raters decide whether symptoms are typical for a remedy delivered or not. The design is triple-blind and placebo-controlled. Result While previous attempts were inconclusive, this new model allowed to separate placebo symptoms from verum symptoms repeatedly in a series of two definitive studies following promising pilot studies. Results were statistically significant. Also, some signs of the purported non-local signature of homeopathic effects were visible, and the consequences for future methodology is discussed. Conclusion Provided some cautionary notes are taken into account, HPTs can be used to separate out true specific symptoms from placebo symptoms. By the same token this is a road to experimental proof that homeopathic remedies are not just placebos. However, this needs to be taken forward by independent groups. "
"Background A model of thyroxine and metamorphosis of highland amphibians is frequently mentioned as an example of experiments on extremely diluted substances in discussions around ‘homeopathy’. Methods The model was scrutinized by reanalysing the results of the initial researcher A and a second researcher B as well as of 5 external researchers C between 1990 and 2013. Rana temporaria larvae were taken from an alpine highland biotope. The test solution was thyroxine 10−30 (T30x), tetra-iodo-thyronine sodium pentahydrate diluted with pure water in 26 steps of 1:10, being agitated after each step. Analogously prepared water (W30x) was used for control. Tadpoles were observed from the 2-legged to the 4-legged stage. Experiments were performed in different years, at different times of season, and their duration could vary. Frequencies of 4-legged animals, effect sizes and areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated and regression analyses were performed to investigate possible correlations between year, season, duration etc. Experiments were in line with animal protection guidelines. A B C Rana temporaria −30 A B C Rana temporaria −30 Results The total set of data A + B + C as well as subsets A (initial researcher, N = 286 + 293), B (second centre, 965 + 965) and C (5 external researchers, 690 + 690) showed an effect of extremely diluted agitated thyroxine reverse to that known of molecular thyroxin, i.e. test values were below control by 11.4% for A, 9.5% for B and 7.0% for C (p < 0.001 for each of the subsets). The effect size (Cohen's d) was >0.8 (large) for both A and B and 0.74 (medium) for C. A B C A B C A B C A B C Conclusion Although a perfect reproducibility was not obtained, this paradoxical phenomenon was generally consistent in different observations. Correlations were found between details of laboratory handling, as well as environment temperature, and the size of the results. "
"Background M1 is a homeopathic medicine with immunostimulatory properties used mainly by cancer patients to complement current therapies. Metastatic melanoma is a skin-originated form of cancer without a single therapy able to produce high rate and sustained responses, which attracts the use of complementary therapies such as M1. However, M1's anti-melanoma effects remain to be pre-clinically demonstrated. Therefore in the present work, we utilized a pulmonary metastatic melanoma model and a subcutaneous melanoma growth model to investigate the potential benefits of treatment with M1. Methods C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously or subcutaneously with B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. After 24 h, mice were treated with either M1 or vehicle (water) for 14 days, euthanized and harvested for multi-parameter pulmonary and tumor analyses. Results Mice treated with M1 had significantly lower tumor burden in the lungs and subcutaneous tissue than control mice. Furthermore, tumors were impaired in proliferation and tumor related angiogenesis by the inhibition of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) positive for angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Conclusion Altogether these data suggest M1 is an efficient candidate for melanoma therapy to be considered for future clinic studies as this study is the first supporting the idea that melanoma patients may benefit with the treatment. The treatment with M1 provides advantages considering the highly-diluted properties and a cost effective alternative to costly chemotherapeutic approaches with, if any, lower toxicity. "
"A systematic approach to the design of simple, chemical systems for investigating the nature of homeopathic medicines has led to the development of an experimental protocol in which solvatochromic dyes are used as molecular probes of serially diluted and agitated solutions. Electronic spectroscopy has been used to follow changes in the absorbance of this class of dyes across the visible spectrum in the presence of homeopathic potencies. Evidence is presented using six different solvatochromic dyes in three different solvent systems. In all cases homeopathic potencies produce consistent and reproducible changes in the spectra of the dyes. Results suggest that potencies influence the supramolecular chemistry of solvatochromic dyes, enhancing either dye aggregation or disaggregation, depending upon dye structure. Comparable dyes lacking the intramolecular charge transfer feature of solvatochromic dyes are unaffected by homeopathic potencies, suggesting potencies require the oscillating dipole of solvatochromic dyes for effective interaction. The implications of the results presented, both for an eventual understanding of the nature of homeopathic medicines and their mode of action, together with future directions for research in this area, are discussed.

"In 1994, Madeleine Bastide described experimental models in immunology that were used during the 1980s to investigate high dilution effects on several biological systems. She classified the available papers in four categories: High dilutions of antigens; High dilutions of thymus, bursa and other hormones; High dilutions of cytokines; Immunopharmacological activity of silica. The studies about high dilutions of antigens were not continued after this period, but gave rise to a long process of a series of in vitro models on antigens and histamine dilutions, that led to the demonstration of the biological modulation effects of these preparations on basophil degranulation. During this process, a multi-centre study was performed, with a high degree of reproducibility among different independent laboratories. in vitro The studies about high diluted cytokines, thymulin and other hormones opened a new line of scientific investigation, about the regulatory properties of endogenous substances prepared according to homeopathic methods. The most frequently studied substance, thymulin, when administered to mice at 5cH potency, is able to improve the activity of phagocytes in different experimental situations, such as viral, bacterial and parasitic infections. The immunopharmacological activity of silica was demonstrated, at that time, as an in vivo illustration of the homeopathic ‘similia principle’. More recently, studies on silica have assumed another focus: the putative role of silica as active contaminant present in high dilutions. This paper presents a follow-up summary on these items, considering the evolution of discoveries from 1994 to 2014. in vivo in vitro in vivo "
"Introduction Hormesis is a dose–response relationship characterized by a biphasic dose response to stressors with a low dose stimulation and a high dose inhibition. The first systematic description of hormesis appeared toward the close of the 18th century by the German pharmacology professor Hugo Schulz. The stressor agent can be any agent or factor capable of causing a deleterious effect. The biological systems can be diverse: bacteria, fungi, algae, yeasts, animals, humans, protozoa and plants. The range of endpoints covers longevity, reproduction, cancer, survival, growth, metabolic effects and others. Hormesis is a nonspecific phenomenon, which can occur in any biological system and can be caused by any stressor. It is quantifiable and reproducible. The apparent similarity between the basic principle of hormesis and homeopathy's Similia Principle, together with the homeopathic claim that hormesis validates homeopathy caused its marginalization, and its rejection during the past century by central figures in pharmacology. Recent years have seen a slight renaissance in the conventional scientific attitude towards hormesis. Method We compared hormesis and homeopathy. Result There is no convincing evidence of similarity between these two systems. Moreover, there are several crucial differences between them, which seem to refute any idea that they stem from the same root. This paper discusses these differences. The rejection of hormesis on grounds of its similarity to homeopathy is unjustified. Conclusion The authors suggest exploring the differences between both systems. Such exploration may answer the key question of whether they do indeed share a root or embrace the same principles. Such exploration may also spur research within both systems to answer further open questions. "
"Background The “Ultra High Dilution 1994” project was an endeavour to take stock of the findings and theories on homeopathic extreme dilutions that were under research at the time in areas of biology, biophysics, physics and medicine. The project finally materialized into an anthology assembling contributions of leading scientists in the field. Over the following two decades, it became widely quoted within the homeopathic community and also known in other research communities. The aim of the present project was to re-visit and review the 1994 studies from the perspective of 2015. Method The original authors from 1994 or close laboratory colleagues were asked to contribute papers covering their research efforts and learnings in the period from 1994 up to 2015. These contributions were edited and cross-referenced, and a selection of further contributions was added. Results About a dozen contributions reported on follow-up experiments and studies, including further developments in theory. Only few of the models that had seemed promising in 1994 had not been followed up later. Most models presented in the original publication had meanwhile been submitted to intra-laboratory, multicentre or independent scrutiny. The results of the follow-up research seemed to have rewarded the efforts. Furthermore, contributions were provided on new models that had been inspired by the original ones or that may be candidates for further in-depth ultra high dilution (UHD) research. Conclusion The project “Ultra High Dilution 1994 revisited 2015” is the latest output of what might be considered the “buena vista social club” of homeopathy research. However, it presents new developments and results of the older, established experimental models as well as a general survey of the state of UHD research. "
"Background Anxiety and sleep disorders (SDS) are frequently treated with psychotropic drugs. Health authorities in France have been advised to improve access to alternative treatments such as homeopathic medicines. Our aim was to describe the socio-demographic characteristics and clinical progression of patients prescribed homeopathic medicine Passiflora Compose (PC) for anxiety and/or SDS. Passiflora Passiflora Material and methods This was an open-label, observational study. Randomly selected general practitioners (GPs) known to prescribe homeopathic medicines recruited consecutive patients (≥18-years) prescribed PC. The following data were recorded at inclusion by the GP: socio-demographic data and anxiety severity (Hamilton anxiety rating scale or HAM-A); and by the patients: level of anxiety (STAI Spielberger self-assessment questionnaire) and SDS (Jenkins sleep scale or JSS). Anxiety and SDS were reassessed after 4 weeks of treatment using the same scales. Results A total of 639 patients (mean age: 46.3 ± 17.5 years; 78.6% female) were recruited by 98 GPs. Anxiety was present in 85.4% (HAM-A) and 93.3% (Spielberger State) at inclusion (mean scores: 17.8 ± 8.91 and 54.59 ± 11.69, respectively) and SDS was present in 74.0% (mean score: 15.24 ± 5.28). A total of 401 (62.7%) patients received PC alone and 167 (26.1%) PC + psychotropics. After 4 weeks, mean anxiety scores decreased by more than 7, 12 and 6 points (HAM-A, Spielberger State and Trait respectively), and SDS score by more than 4 points (JSS). Conclusion Anxiety and/or SDS improved significantly in patients included on this study. PC could be an alternative to the use of psychotropic drugs for first intention treatment of anxiety and SDS. Further studies are needed to confirm those results. "
"The memory of water was a radical idea that arose in the laboratory of Jacques Benveniste in the late 1980s. Twenty-five years have passed and yet the often angry debate on its merits continues despite the increasing number of scientists who have reported confirmation of the basic results. One working hypothesis was that molecules can communicate with each other, exchanging information without being in physical contact and that at least some biological functions can be mimicked by certain energetic modes characteristics of a given molecule. These considerations informed exploratory research which led to the speculation that biological signaling might be transmissible by electromagnetic means. Around 1991, the transfer of specific molecular signals to sensitive biological systems was achieved using an amplifier and electromagnetic coils. In 1995, a more sophisticated procedure was established to record, digitize and replay these signals using a multimedia computer. From a physical and chemical perspective, these experiments pose a riddle, since it is not clear what mechanism can sustain such ‘water memory’ of the exposure to molecular signals. From a biological perspective, the puzzle is what nature of imprinted effect (water structure) can impact biological function. A parallel can be drawn between this debate on the memory of water, which presumes that the action of molecules is mediated by an electromagnetic phenomenon, and the often acrimonious debate on the transmission of nerve influxes via synaptic transfer of specific molecules, neurotransmitters. The latter debate began in 1921 with the first experiments by Loewi and was still active in 1949, 28 years later. A strong reluctance to accept research that questions basic aspects of long-accepted biochemical paradigms is to be expected. In this paper we will provide a brief summary of experiments relating to the memory of water: the earlier work on high dilutions (HD) and then the experiments, which followed and continue today, on digital biology.

"Background Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine in which uses highly diluted preparations that are believed to cause healthy people to exhibit symptoms similar to those exhibited by patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dragonfly (Anax imperator, Anax i.) on learning and memory in naive mice using the Morris water maze (MWM) test; moreover, the effects of dragonfly on MK-801-induced cognitive dysfunction were evaluated. Anax imperator, Anax i. Anax imperator, Anax i. Methods Male balb-c mice were treated with dragonfly (30C and 200C) or MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) alone or concurrently (n = 10). Dragonfly (D) and MK-801 were administered subchronically for 6 days intraperitoneally 60 min and 30 min, respectively, before the daily performance of the MWM test. Results This study revealed that in the familiarization session and first session of the MWM test, Anax i. D30 significantly decreased escape latency compared to the control group, although MK-801, D30 and D200 significantly increased escape latency at the end of five acquisition sessions. Anax i. combined with dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) also significantly decreased escape latency in the familiarization session and first session of the MWM test, although this combination increased escape latency compared to the MK-801 alone group at the end of the test. Time spent in escape platform's quadrant in the probe trial significantly decreased while mean distance to platform significantly increased in MK-801, D30 and D200 groups. In the MWM test, Anax i. combined with MK-801 significantly decreased speed of the animals compared to the MK-801 alone group. General cell morphology was disturbed in the MK-801 group while D30 and D200 seemed to improve cell damage in the MK-801 group. Anax i Anax i Anax i Anax i Anax i Anax i Conclusions These results suggest that the homeopathic Anax i. can impair learning acquisition and reference memory, and it has beneficial effects on disturbed cell morphology.

"Introduction Fundamental research into the scientific basis of the manufacture of ultra-high dilutions and their working in applications has evolved over the past twenty years since our last critical analysis of the field was published in 1994 [1]. New contenders from the realm of physics (entanglement, non-locality) have entered the scene. The vast majority within the community of the application of ultra-high dilutions are not physicists. This paper attempts to elucidate the concepts of entanglement, non-locality and their application in ultra-high dilution research (UHD). Method A selected study on the activity of fundamental research into UHD is performed to gain insight into trends of development activity of fundamental research in this area. In an attempt to nurture further development of theoretical models in fundamental research in UHD, an attempt is made to made recent theoretical concepts more accessible to the larger community including practitioners, policy makers and beneficiaries of UHD. Results Fundamental research in UHD had a period of prolific activity and recognition at the turn of the millennium until about ten years ago. Since then, research output as well as its recognition receded sharply suggesting that a period of reflection and consolidation may be in progress. Conclusion The study and the knowledge gained from more recent theoretical models in UHD and entanglement suggest that there may be some benefit in stocktaking of what we really know about the fundamental workings of UHD as well as identifying or developing models that include measurable predictors that go beyond metaphorical descriptors.

"Background Influenza and its complications are common at all ages, especially in children. Vaccines and anti-influenza drugs aim to prevent it. Preventative approaches with favorable risk profiles should be considered for flu, particularly since the evidence of the efficacy of anti-viral drugs is debated. Methods This pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in the Brazilian Public Health System in Petrópolis (BPHSP) with children aged from 1 to 5 years old. The medications used were mainly selected based on in vitro experiments (InfluBio), and in successful qualitative clinical experiences (Homeopathic Complex). Following informed parental consent, subjects were randomly distributed, in a blind manner, to three experimental groups: Homeopathic Complex, Placebo, and InfluBio. BPHSP health agents collected flu and acute respiratory infection symptomatic episodes monthly following the established protocol. The number of these episodes was registered in one year (2009–2010). in vitro in vitro Results Out of the 600 children recruited, 445 (74.17%) completed the study (149: Homeopathic complex; 151: Placebo; 145: InfluBio). The number of flu and acute respiratory infection symptomatic episodes detected in this clinical trial was low; however, it was different between homeopathic groups and placebo (p < 0.001). In the first year post-intervention, 46/151 (30.5%) of children in the placebo group developed 3 or more flu and acute respiratory infection episodes, while there was no episode in the group of 149 children who used Homeopathic Complex, and only 1 episode in the group of 145 (1%) children who received InfluBio. Conclusion These results suggested that the use of homeopathic medicines minimized the number of flu and acute respiratory infection symptomatic episodes in children, signalizing that the homeopathic prophylactic potential should be investigated in further studies.

"Introduction The aim of this study was to develop a criteria catalogue serving as a guideline for authors to improve quality of Reporting Experiments in Homeopathic Basic Research (REHBaR). Main focus was in the field of biochemical and biological experiments. So far, there was no guideline for scientists and authors available, unlike criteria catalogues common in clinical research. REHBaR REHBaR Methods A Delphi Process was conducted among experts who published experimental work within the last five years in this field. The process included a total of five rounds, three rounds of adjusting and phrasing plus two consensus conferences. Results A checklist of 23 items was achieved, augmented with detailed examples how to handle each item while compiling a publication. Background, objectives and possible hypotheses are necessary to be given in the part ‘introduction’. The section ‘materials and methods’ is the most important part, where a detailed description of chosen controls, object of investigation, experimental setup, replication, parameters, intervention, allocation, blinding, and statistical methods is mandatory. In the ‘results’ section sufficient details on analysed data, descriptive as well as inferential are needed. Moreover, authors should discuss their results and interpret them in the context of current evidence. REHBaR was compiled for authors when preparing their manuscripts, and to be used by scientific journals in the reviewing process. REHBaR REHBaR Conclusions Reporting experiments in basic research in homeopathy is an important issue to state the quality and validity of gained results. A guideline for REHBaR seemed to be the first step to come to a commitment what information is necessary to be given in a paper. More than that, the catalogue can serve as a statement what the standards in good basic research should be. REHBaR REHBaR "
"Introduction Our first evaluation of fundamental research into the physics and physiology of Ultra High Dilution (UHD) was conducted in 1994. Since then, in 2003, Becker-Witt et al.1 conducted a more systematic evaluation of the literature and established the Score for Assessment of Physical Experiments on Homeopathy (SAPEH). While this evaluation focused on experimental methodologies, Stock-Schröer et al.,2 in 2009, formulated a detailed guideline for authors on Reporting Experiments in Homeopathic Basic research (REHBaR) to promote a high standard in research as well as in its communication in scientific literature. et al 1 et al 2 et al 1 et al 2 Method In this paper, we evaluate publications on basic research into the physics of UHD since the decade following the presentation of the SAPEH score (2004–2014), and present the state of progress in this field. Results Fundamental research into the physics of UHD has been reported at a steady rate over the past 60 years. Reported research of high quality as per SAPEH scoring appears to be still the exception rather than standard. Conclusion Considering the importance of a fundamental understanding of what makes a UHD preparation, results of this study suggest that it may be beneficial to this field of fundamental research if grant challenges are approached in strategic way similar to other grant challenges in science.

"Objectives The objective was to evaluate homeopathic basic research studies that use plant-based bioassays. With this in view, a compilation was made of the findings of three systematic literature reviews covering plant-based bioassays in the three fields of healthy, abiotically, or biotically stressed plants. This compilation focused on investigations using advanced experimental methods and detailed descriptions, also with the aim of supporting the design of future experiments. Methods Publications included had to report on studies into the effects of homeopathic preparations on whole plants, seeds, plant parts and cells. Outcomes had to be measured by established procedures and statistically evaluated. A Manuscript Information Score (MIS) was applied using predefined criteria to identify publications with sufficient information for adequate interpretation (MIS ≥ 5). Additional evaluation focused on the use of adequate controls to investigate specific effects of homeopathic preparations, and on the use of systematic negative control (SNC) experiments to ensure the stability of the bioassay. Only a fraction of the studies reported here were performed with ‘ultra high’ dilutions, whereas other studies were performed with moderate or high dilutions. Results A total of 157 publications were identified, describing a total of 167 experimental studies. 84 studies included statistics and 48 had a MIS ≥ 5, thus allowing adequate interpretation. 29 studies had adequate controls to identify specific effects of homeopathic preparations, and reported significant effects of decimal and centesimal homeopathic potencies, including dilution levels beyond Avogadro's number. 10 studies reported use of SNC experiments, yielding evidence for the stability of the experimental set-up. Conclusion Plant models appear to be a useful approach for investigating basic research questions relating to homeopathic preparations, but more independent replication trials are needed in order to verify the results found in single experiments. Adequate controls and SNC experiments should be implemented on a routine basis to exclude false-positive results. "
"Background Phials containing high dilutions of homeopathic remedies are commonly utilized in diagnostic tools in combination with electro acupuncture measuring electrical conductivity of the skin. The present research aimed to elucidate the interaction of the homeopathic remedy and the human organism. Method The study protocol included the transition of a healthy subject to a diseased state utilizing a sub-harmful dose of a toxin. Subsequently, the subject was exposed to a homeopathic or placebo remedy in a closed glass phial and electrical conductivity was measured in open as well as in blind trials. A total of 229 data were collected from open trials and 750 data from blind trials. Result The experimental data showed that homoeopathic remedies in closed glass phials may influence the electrical skin conductivity. The results of the blind trials differed considerably from those of the open trials. The percentage of correctly identified (verum and placebo) phials in the open trials (85%) was statistically different from those in the blind trials (65%). In both types of trials, however, the difference between the sealed phials containing the homeopathic medicine and the placebo was statistically significant. The results of measurements are directly linked to the way in which the tester holds the electrode in one hand and the subject's finger in the other, while putting pressure on the electrode. Conclusion It was concluded that the tester's muscle tone is the intermediary in unconsciously selecting which phial influenced him in his specific contact with the subject. "
"Background Experiments about basic research in Immuno-allergology reported by M. Bastide and B. Poitevin in Ultra High Dilution (1994) have been appraised from a 20 year perspective. The numerous experiments published mainly focus on immunological regulation, inflammatory process and basophil activation. They are analyzed according to one essential criterion: repeatability. Ultra High Dilution Ultra High Dilution Methods The commentary reflects the research details made available in a recently published literature review, also published in French. Results The regulatory effect of high dilution of bursin on immune response has been observed in multiple experiments but not reproduced by independent teams. The immunomodulating effect of Thymulin has been confirmed in mice. Rhus toxicodendron has an anti-inflammatory activity on different models, from mother tincture (TM) to very high dilutions. The homeopathic complex Canova activates macrophages in vitro and in vivo, induces lymphocyte proliferation, and reduces the size of tumors and mortality of sarcoma-bearing mice. Some homeopathic medicines used in clinical inflammation modulate in vitro the neutrophil activation, with variability in the protocols used and in the medicines tested. In allergology, high dilution histamine has an inhibitory effect on basophil activation in multicenter trials and with independent teams, either with methods implying a change in basophil staining or with flow cytometry. However, high dilution histamine had no effect in some well-conducted experiments. The inhibitory effect of Apis mellifica has not been studied with the flow cytometry method, as well as the activation of basophil by anti-IgE high dilution, published in Nature. Rhus toxicodendron in vitro in vivo in vitro Apis mellifica Rhus toxicodendron in vitro in vivo in vitro Apis mellifica Conclusions Despite considerable research activity in immuno-allergology and a great increase in the number of publications, there is still not in this domain a “gold standard” trial in basic research in homeopathy. The most studied system, the inhibitory effect of histamine high dilutions on basophil activation, requires clarifications of various factors, including individual sensitivity. For scientific and epistemological reasons, the same work should be carried out for independent reproduction of the experiments conducted with anti-IgE and Apis mel high dilution, in complement of the new axes of research in immunoallergology developed since 20 years.

"Background In the 1990s, a study was performed on the effects of highly diluted thyroxine on frog metamorphosis. This model represented one of the most discussed examples of the biological effects of high dilutions over the next two decades. In 2010, another critical conceptual review of the use of animal models in homeopathy and high-dilution research was published. The main contribution of these studies was the elucidation of the biological features and phenomenology of the effects of high dilutions on living systems, representing an important step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of homeopathic medicines. Methods We performed a further review of this line of investigation using the same methods. Fifty-three articles that were indexed in the PubMed database and used 12 different animal species were systematically evaluated. Only a fraction of the studies (29/53) reported herein were performed with “ultra high” dilutions. The other studies were performed with dilutions in ranges below 10−23 (14/53 articles) or commercial complexes (10/53 articles). −23 −23 Results Only two articles reported negative results; both used in vivo protocols to test commercial complexes, one in fish and one in bees. The quality of the employed techniques improved in 2010–2014 compared with the studies that were reviewed previously in 2010, with the inclusion of more ethically refined protocols, including in vitro primary cell cultures and ex vivo studies (10/53 articles), often with three or more replicates and analyses of epigenetic mechanisms that were previously unknown in 2010. in vivo in vitro ex vivo in vivo in vitro ex vivo Conclusion In our updated review of the past 5 years, we found further demonstrations of the biological effects of homeopathy using more refined animal models and in vitro techniques. in vitro in vitro "
"Introduction Observations about controlled clinical trials expressed by Max Haidvogl in the book Ultra High Dilution (1994) have been appraised from a perspective two decades later. The present commentary briefly examines changes in homeopathy research evidence since 1994 as regards: the published number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the use of individualised homeopathic intervention, the ‘proven efficacy of homeopathy’, and the quality of the evidence. Ultra High Dilution Ultra High Dilution Methods The commentary reflects the details of RCTs that are available in a recently published literature review and by scrutiny of systematic reviews of RCTs in homeopathy. Results The homeopathy RCT literature grew by 309 records in the 18 years that immediately followed Haidvogl's article, with more than a doubling of the proportion that investigated individualised homeopathy. Discounting one prior publication, the entire systematic review literature on homeopathy RCTs post-dates 1994. A total of 36 condition-specific systematic reviews have been identified in the peer-reviewed literature: 16 of them reported positive, or tentatively positive, conclusions about homeopathy's clinical effectiveness; the other 20 were negative or non-conclusive. Reviews typically have been restricted in the strength of their conclusions by the low quality of the original RCT evidence. Three comprehensive systematic reviews concluded, cautiously, that homeopathy may differ from placebo; a fourth such review reached negative conclusions. A recent high-quality meta-analysis concluded that medicines prescribed in individualised homeopathic treatment may have small, specific, effects. Conclusions Despite important growth in research activity since 1994, concerns about study quality limit the interpretation of available RCT data. The question whether homeopathic intervention differs from placebo awaits decisive answer. "
"Background Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperglycemia eventually resulting in long-term complications. Increased glycation of proteins is implicated in the pathogenesis of complications. For treatment of diabetes, Syzygium jambolanum and Cephalandra indica are frequently prescribed in homeopathy. However their role in glycation is not well elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of these homeopathic preparations in glycation induced structural modifications and further to examine their cellular protection ability. Syzygium jambolanum Cephalandra indica Syzygium jambolanum Cephalandra indica Methods In human erythrocytes, in vitro mother tincture and dilutions of S. jambolanum (Sj ф, 30c, 200c), C. indica (Ci ф, 30c, 200c) and standard antiglycator (AG) were compared and their antiglycation potential assessed by the estimating different markers of glycation (frcutosamines, carbonyls, bound sugar), structural modifications (free amino and thiol group).

"Aim To explore the experiences of parents who chose homeopathic treatment for their children, with particular regard to the decision-making process within the family and the availability of conventional and homeopathic healthcare services. Methods Semi-structured interview with parents immediately after or before the homeopathic visit at the Homeopathic Clinic of Campo di Marte Hospital of Lucca (Italy) from1st March, 2012 to 18 July 2012. Answers were analyzed by frequency of response and grouped into main areas: 1. Choice of homeopathy. 2. Intra-family dynamics. 3. Behaviour in emergency situations. 4. The relationship with the homeopathic doctor. 5. The role of friends and acquaintances. 6. The ‘cut off’ of use of homeopathy. Results Parents who choose homeopathic treatments for their children are strongly influenced by context. The choice of homeopathy is usually made by mothers and is rarely hindered by fathers, grandparents or friends, whose approval is important and encourages parents to use homeopathy for their children, both for prevention and treatment. Easy access to the homeopathic doctor was frequently requested, especially for acute situations. Conclusion This research confirms the importance of context in decision making processes. Other characteristics of families which use homeopathy, such as level of education, personal coping strategies and family context should be investigated. "
"Background Utilization of sedative hypnotic drugs for sleeping disorders (SD) raises concerns, particularly among older people. This study compared utilization of conventional psychotropic drugs for SD among patients seeking care from general practitioners (GPs) who strictly prescribe conventional medications (GP-CM), regularly prescribe homeopathy in a mixed practice (GP-Mx), or are certified homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho). Methods This was a French population-based cohort study of GPs and their patients consulting for SD, informed through the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire. Information on psychotropic drugs utilization was obtained from a standardized telephone interview at inclusion, one, three and 12 months. Results 346 patients consulting for SD were included. Patients in the GP-Ho group experienced more often severe SD (41.3%) than patients in the GP-CM group (24.3%). Adjusted multivariate analyses showed that patients who chose to be managed by GP-Ho were less likely to use psychotropic drugs over 12 months as opposed to the GP-CM group, with Odds ratio (OR) = 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14 to 0.42. Patients in the GP-Mx group also used less psychotropic drugs but the result was not statistically significant (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.39–1.16). Rates of clinical improvement of the SD did not differ between groups. Conclusions Patients with SD who chose to consult GPs certified in homeopathy consumed less psychotropic drugs and had a similar evolution of their condition to patients treated with conventional medical management. This result may translate in a net advantage with reduction of adverse events related to psychotropic drugs. "
"Purpose The purpose of the study was to explore the experiences of homeopaths who have established successful private practices in South Africa (SA) with the aim of identifying some of their intrapersonal qualities which may have contributed to their establishing a successful practice. Method This was a qualitative phenomenological research design using in-depth interviews with homeopaths running successful private practices across 5 provinces in SA, which were digitally recorded. Of these, 18 were transcribed and analysed using a descriptive coding approach and strategies for phenomenological analysis. Themes and supporting categories are identified and described. Findings Homeopaths experiences suggest that they are authentic, self-aware, self-reflective and proactive. They experienced a need for self-care and support and further found that their integrity, positive attitude, self-discipline and passion, contributed to their success in practice. Conclusion The intrapersonal qualities can be roughly divided between those that generate inner-support and those which aid homeopaths attain their goal of establishing a practice and are therefore crucial aspects of success generation.

"This paper summarizes the results of investigations showing how molecular biological tools, such as DNA-microarrays, can provide useful suggestions about the behaviour of human organisms treated with microamounts of drugs or homeopathic medicines. The results reviewed here suggest firstly that the action of drugs is not quenched by ultra-high dilution and proceeds through modulation of gene expressions. The efficacy of drug solutions seems to be maintained in ultra-highly diluted preparations, a fact which constitutes a challenge to the dogma of quantization of matter. The second and more important result is that the different gene expression profiles of cell systems treated with the same drugs at different dilutions suggest the existence of hormetic mechanisms. The gene expression profiles of cells treated with copper(II) sulfate, Gelsemium sempervirens and Apis mellifica, are characterized by the same common denominator of the concentration-dependent inversion of gene expression, which can justify at a molecular level the concept of simile adopted in homeopathy. Gelsemium sempervirens Apis mellifica, simile The main conclusion we draw from these results is that these procedures provide new kinds of information and a tool for disclosing the mechanisms involved in hormetic effects. The application of these effects to modern medicine may allow researchers to conceive unprecedented therapeutic applications or to optimize the currently used ones in the framework of a low-dose pharmacology based on a reliable experimental platform. Gelsemium sempervirens Apis mellifica, simile "
"Hormesis has emerged as a central concept in biological and biomedical sciences with significant implications for clinical medicine and environmental risk assessment. This paper assesses the historical foundations of the dose–response including the threshold, linear and hormetic models, the occurrence and frequency of the hormetic dose response in the pharmacological and toxicological literature, its quantitative and temporal features, and underlying mechanistic bases. Based upon this integrative foundation the application of hormesis to the process of risk assessment for non-carcinogens and carcinogens is explored. "
"Multiple studies have demonstrated that traditional homeopathic manufacturing reagents and processes can generate remedy source and silica nanoparticles (NPs). Homeopathically-made NPs would initiate adaptive changes in an organism as a complex adaptive system (CAS) or network. Adaptive changes would emerge from several different endogenous amplification processes that respond to exogenous danger or threat signals that manufactured nanomaterials convey, including (1) stochastic resonance (SR) in sensory neural systems and (2) time-dependent sensitization (TDS)/oscillation. SR is nonlinear coherent amplification of a weak signal by the superposition of a larger magnitude white noise containing within it the same frequencies of the weak signal. TDS is progressive response magnitude amplification and oscillatory reversal in response direction to a given low dose at physiological limits with the passage of time. Hormesis is an overarching adaptive phenomenon that reflects the observed nonlinear adaptive dose–response relationship. Remedies would act as enhanced micro- and nanoscale forms of their source material via direct local ligand-receptor interactions at very low potencies and/or by triggering systemic adaptive network dynamical effects via their NP-based electromagnetic, optical, and quantum mechanical properties at higher potencies. Manufacturing parameters including dilution modify sizes, shapes, and surface charges of nanoparticles, thereby causing differences in physico-chemical properties and biological effects. Based on surface area, size, shape, and charge, nanoparticles adsorb a complex pattern of serum proteins, forming a protein corona on contact that constitutes a unique biological identity. The protein corona may capture individualized dysfunctional biological mediator information of the organism onto the surfaces of the salient, i.e., resonant, remedy nanostructures. SR would amplify this weak signal from the salient remedy NPs with protein corona adsorbed, leading to sensitized nonlinear dynamical modulation of gene expression and associated changes in biological signaling pathways. When the system reaches its physiological limits during a homeopathic aggravation or the natural disease state, the amplified remedy signal triggers a nonlinear reversal in dynamical direction back towards health.

"Background Though potentially an important limitation in the literature of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of homeopathy, the model validity of homeopathic treatment (MVHT) has not previously been systematically investigated. Objective As an integral part of a programme of systematic reviews, to assess MVHT of eligible RCTs of individualised homeopathic treatment. Methods From 46 previously identified papers in the category, 31 papers (reporting a total of 32 RCTs) were eligible for systematic review and were thus the subject of the study. For each of six domains of assessment per trial, MVHT was judged independently by three randomly allocated assessors from our group, who reached a final verdict by consensus discussion as necessary. Results Nineteen trials were judged overall as ‘acceptable’ MVHT, nine as ‘uncertain’ MVHT, and four as ‘inadequate’ MVHT. Conclusions These results do not support concern that deficient MVHT has frequently undermined the published findings of RCTs of individualised homeopathy. However, the 13 trials with ‘uncertain’ or ‘inadequate’ MVHT will be a focus of attention in supplementary meta-analysis. New RCTs of individualised homeopathy must aim to maximise MVHT and to enable its assessment through clear reporting. "
"Nanobubbles (NBs) have been a subject of intensive research over the past decade. Their peculiar characteristics, including extremely low buoyancy, longevity, enhanced solubility of oxygen in water, zeta potentials and burst during collapse, have led to many applications in the industrial, biological and medical fields. NBs may form spontaneously from dissolved gas but the process is greatly enhanced by gas supersaturation and mechanical actions such as dynamization. Therefore, the formation of NBs during the preparation of homeopathic dilutions under atmospheric pressure cannot be ignored. I suggested in 2009 the involvement of NBs in nanometric superstructures revealed in high dilutions using NMR relaxation. These superstructures seemed to increase in size with dilution, well into the ultramolecular range (>12c). I report here new experiments that confirm the involvement of NBs and prove the crucial role of dynamization to create superstructures specific to the solute. A second dynamization was shown to enhance or regenerate these superstructures. I postulate that superstructures result from a nucleation process of NBs around the solute, with shells of highly organized water (with ions and silicates if any) which protect the solute against out-diffusion and behave as nucleation centres for further dilution steps. The sampling tip may play an active role by catching the superstructures and thus carry the encaged solute across the dilution range, possibly up to the ultramolecular range. The superstructures were not observed at low dilution, probably because of a destructuring of the solvent by the solute and/or of an inadequate gas/solute ratio. "
"It has been claimed that the homeopathic principle of ‘similarity’ (or ‘similia’) and the use of individualized remedies in extremely low doses conflicts with scientific laws, but this opinion can be disputed on the basis of recent scientific advances. Several mechanisms to explain the responsiveness of cells to ultra-low doses and the similarity as inversion of drug effects, have again been suggested in the framework of hormesis and modern paradoxical pharmacology. Low doses or high dilutions of a drug interact only with the enhanced sensitivities of regulatory systems, functioning as minute harmful stimuli to trigger specific compensatory healing reactions. Here we review hypotheses about homeopathic drug action at cellular and molecular levels, and present a new conceptual model of the principle of similarity based on allosteric drug action. While many common drugs act through orthostatic chemical interactions aimed at blocking undesired activities of enzymes or receptors, allosteric interactions are associated with dynamic conformational changes and functional transitions in target proteins, which enhance or inhibit specific cellular actions in normal or disease states. The concept of allostery and the way it controls physiological activities can be broadened to include diluted/dynamized compounds, and may constitute a working hypothesis for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the inversion of drug effects.

"Introduction Aflatoxins are toxic fungal metabolites that have adverse effects on humans and animals. Tarantula cubensis D6 is used as a homeopathic medicine for different purposes. The present study investigates the effects of Tarantula cubensis D6 on the oxidant-antioxidant balance and some biochemical parameters against exposure to aflatoxin. Tarantula cubensis Tarantula cubensis Tarantula cubensis Tarantula cubensis Methods Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley female rats were used and evenly divided into four groups. Group 1 served as control. Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 200 μl/kg.bw/day Tarantula cubensis D6 (applied subcutaneously), 400 μg/kg.bw/day total aflatoxin (approximately 80% AF B1, 10% AF B2, 6 %AF G1, and 4%AF G2), and 200 μl/kg.bw/day Tarantula cubensis D6 plus 400 μg/kg.bw/day total aflatoxin, respectively, for 28 days. At the end of 28 days, blood samples and some organs (liver, kidney, brain, and spleen) were taken from all the animals. Oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) and some biochemical parameters (glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT and ALP, total protein, albumin) were evaluated in blood samples and tissues. Tarantula cubensis 1 2 1 2 Tarantula cubensis Tarantula cubensis 1 2 1 2 Tarantula cubensis Results Aflatoxin caused negative changes in all oxidative stress parameters and some biochemical parameters (glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, creatinine, AST, ALT, ALP, total protein, albumin). Administration of Tarantula cubensis D6 partly alleviated aflatoxin-induced negative changes. Conclusions Our results indicated that Tarantula cubensis D6 partially neutralized the deleterious effects of aflatoxin. Tarantula cubensis Tarantula cubensis "
"The debate between those who believe homeopathy and hormesis derive from the same root and those who believe the two are different phenomena is as old as hormesis. It is an emotionally loaded discussion, with both sides fielding arguments which are far from scientific. Careful analysis of the basic paradigms of the two systems questions the claim of the homeopaths, who find similarities between them. The authors discuss these paradigms, indicating the differences between the claims of homeopathy and hormesis. It is time for thorough and serious research to lay this question to rest. One possible approach is to compare the activity of a hormetic agent, prepared in the usual way, with that of the same agent in the same concentration prepared homeopathically by serial dilution and succussion.

"Background Our previous work suggests that Thuja occidentalis, Carcinosinum and Ruta graveolens have antineoplastic properties. The mechanism of this action has not previously been studied. We studied the hypothesis that the mechanism of action is through the immune modulation. Thuja occidentalis Carcinosinum Ruta graveolens Thuja occidentalis Carcinosinum Ruta graveolens Methods We evaluated the effects of Thuja occidentalis, Carcinosinum and Ruta graveolens 1M, 200c and 30c on the immune system of Balb/c mice. The homeopathic preparations were administered orally for ten consecutive days. Haematological parameters (Total White Blood Cell (WBC) Count, Differential Count and Haemoglobin content), haematopoietic parameters (bone marrow cellularity and α-esterase positive cells) and immune parameters for antibody response and lymphoid cell proliferation were assessed using standard methods. Results were analysed by statistical comparison with the control. Thuja occidentalis Carcinosinum Ruta graveolens Thuja occidentalis Carcinosinum Ruta graveolens Results We observed significant enhancement of haematological parameters including total WBC count, haematopoietic parameters such as bone marrow cellularity and the number of α-esterase positive cells, other parameters of immune response such as circulating antibody titre and the number of plaque forming cells (PFC), particularly with higher dilutions of Thuja and Ruta. Enhanced proliferation of B and T lymphoid cells was also observed. No toxic effects were observed. Thuja Ruta Thuja Ruta Conclusions The results suggest immunomodulatory activity of homeopathic preparations in high dilution. This may be a mechanism through which homeopathic preparations act. "
"The present paper provides an historical assessment of the concept of hormesis and its relationship to homeopathy and modern medicine. It is argued that the dose–response concept was profoundly influenced by the conflict between homeopathy and traditional medicine and that decisions on which dose–response model to adopt were not based on “science” but rater on historical antipathies. While the historical dispute between homeopathy and traditional medicine has long since subsided, their impact upon the field has been enduring and generally unappreciated, profoundly adversely affecting current drug development, therapeutic strategies and environmental risk assessment strategies and policies. "
This paper provides an assessment of the mechanistic foundations of hormesis and how such understandings evolved over the course of the past century. Particular emphasis is placed on recent developments particularly with respect to receptor-based and cell signaling-based pathways. Of particular importance is that the quantitative feature of the hormetic dose response are independent of mechanism. 
"Collection of data concerning case histories is not yet common in homeopathy despite its great importance for this method. Computer program development progresses slowly and discussion about requirements is scarce. Two Dutch projects assessed Materia Medica of some homeopathic medicines and six homeopathic symptoms. Especially the second project relied heavily on data collection. In both projects much effort was spent on consensus between participating doctors. There was much variance between doctors despite our consensus efforts. Assessing causality seems the most important source of bias, there is also much variance in assessing symptoms. Conclusion Data collection software should be developed step-by-step, guided by close monitoring and feedback of participating practitioners. "
"Background Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of veterinary homeopathy has not previously been undertaken. For all medical conditions and species collectively, we tested the hypothesis that the outcome of homeopathic intervention (treatment and/or prophylaxis, individualised and/or non-individualised) is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. Methods All facets of the review, including literature search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, were described in an earlier paper. A trial was judged to comprise reliable evidence if its risk of bias was low or was unclear in specific domains of assessment. Effect size was reported as odds ratio (OR). A trial was judged free of vested interest if it was not funded by a homeopathic pharmacy. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model, with hypothesis-driven sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias. Results Nine of 15 trials with extractable data displayed high risk of bias; low or unclear risk of bias was attributed to each of the remaining six trials, only two of which comprised reliable evidence without overt vested interest. For all N = 15 trials, pooled OR = 1.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12 to 2.56]; P = 0.01. For the N = 2 trials with suitably reliable evidence, pooled OR = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.13 to 6.05]; P = 0.02). N P N P N P N P Conclusions Meta-analysis provides some very limited evidence that clinical intervention in animals using homeopathic medicines is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. The low number and quality of the trials hinders a more decisive conclusion. "
"In the present study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of various potencies of Ruta graveolens (Ruta) on COLO-205 cell line, as evidenced by cytotoxicity, migration, clonogenecity, morphological and biochemical changes and modification in the levels of genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle. On treatment of COLO-205 cells maximal effects were seen with mother tincture (MT) and 30C potencies, wherein decrease in cell viability along with reduced clonogenecity and migration capabilities were noted. In addition morphological and biochemical alterations such as nuclear changes (fragmented nuclei with condensed chromatin) and DNA ladder-like pattern (increased amount of fragmented DNA) in COLO-205 cells indicating apoptotic related cell death were seen. The expression of apoptosis and cell-cycle related regulatory genes assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed an up-regulation of caspase 9, caspase-3, Bax, p21 and p27 expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression in treated cells. The mode of cell death was suggestive of intrinsic apoptotic pathway along with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M of the cell cycle. Our findings indicate that phytochemicals present in Ruta showed potential for natural therapeutic product development for colon carcinoma. Ruta graveolens Ruta Ruta Ruta graveolens Ruta Ruta "
"Background Potentization, consisting of serial dilution and succussion, is a key step in the manufacture of homeopathic medicines. Originally prescribed as a manual process, several attempts at mechanization have been published, patented and even commercialised in order to remove the human element and introduce reproducibility without drudgery. Various machines have been used over the years to prepare homeopathic medicines. Although these machines follow the same principles, i.e. energetically mixing the medicines and diluting them significantly, their mode of operation is different from each other. Methods This review paper surveys the main methods of preparation of homeopathic medicines. The main machines discussed are: Boericke's potentizer, Tyler Kent's instrument, John Alphonse's machine and the fluxion potentizer, which were used in the past, as well as more recent potentizers like arm-and-weight instruments, the K-Tronic potentizer and Quinn's machine. We review the construction and operating principle of each of these machines, along with their advantages and limitations. A scheme for relative performance assessment of these machines is proposed based on the parameters mechanical efficiency, physico-chemical efficiency, turbulence generation, energy dissipation, and accuracy of dilution. Results Quinn's machine and the arm-and-weight potentizer perform well for generating turbulence due to high impaction forces, while John Alphonse's machine is much more accurate in diluting the homeopathic medicines at every step. Conclusions Both the commercial potentizers, Quinn's machine and the K-Tronic potentizer, are completely automated and therefore reduce the manual labour and variation in succussive forces during each step, which may produce uniformity in physico-chemical changes within the resulting homeopathic medicines.

"Objectives To examine if HIV nosode in 30c dilution (HIV 30c) has therapeutic potential against lung cancer cells (A549) as compared to WRL-68 normal cells and to elucidate its possible molecular mechanism of action on DNA replication and apoptosis. Methods Effects of HIV 30c were thoroughly tested for its possible anticancer potential on A549 cells (lung cancer); WRL-68 normal liver cells served as control. Three doses, one at LD50 and two below LD-50, were used. Proliferation, migration and senescence assays were made and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) studied by routine techniques. The ability of HIV 30c to induce apoptosis in A549 cells and its possible signalling pathway were determined using immunoblots of relevant signal proteins and confocal microscopy, including studies on telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and topoisomerase II (Top II) activities, intimately associated with cell division and DNA replication. Results HIV 30c prevented cancer cell proliferation and migration, induced pre-mature senescence, enhanced pro-apoptotic signal proteins like p53, bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and inhibited anti-apoptotic signal proteins Bcl2, TERT and Top II, changed mitochondrial membrane potential and caused externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Thus, it induced apoptosis as also evidenced from increase in cells with distorted membrane morphology, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and ROS, typical of apoptosis in progress. Conclusion HIV 30c nosode has therapeutic potential for inducing cytotoxic effects on A549 cells as manifested by changes in nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, ROS generation and MMP, and for its inhibitory action on cell proliferation, cell migration, expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase and Top II genes, and increasing expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

"Background Host immunity plays an important role in prevention of disease as is evident by the increased incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) in immuno-compromised population of HIV infected, diabetes inflicted, immune-suppressant therapy and elderly people. Rising incidence of antibiotic resistance has led to resurgence of TB of epidemic proportions. Integrated treatment with add on homeopathy in addition to anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) appears to improve outcome in TB. The intervention has been integrated treatment with homeopathy regime, which is using a patient specific, disease specific and supportive medicine simultaneously, all individualized for the patient and the disease. Cases: Case 1 Pott's spine with paravertebral abscess, not responding to ATT. Addition of homeopathy led to fall in temperature, improved appetite, increase in weight and reduction of abscess. Case 2 Recurrent sub-acute intestinal obstruction. The patient could not tolerate ATT but responded to homeopathy by reduction of abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, loose stools and queasiness. Case 3 Pulmonary TB, treated with both ATT and homeopathy from beginning, led to rapid recovery and shortened treatment time. Conclusion The addition of homeopathy to ATT is patient friendly, cost effective and appears to reduces the duration of treatment. Its role as immuno-modulatory therapy should be evaluated and explored. "
"Background NMR proton relaxation is sensitive to the dynamics of the water molecule H2O, through the interaction of the spin of the proton (1H) with external magnetic and electromagnetic fields. 2 1 2 1 Methods We measured dilution and potentization processes through measurements of 1H spin-lattice T1 and spin–spin T2 relaxation times. In order to interpret the recorded fluctuations in T1- or T2-values, experimental data were linearized by investigating how the area under a fluctuating time = f(dilution) curve (dilution integral or DI) changes with dilution. Two kinds of fitting procedures were considered: chi-square fitting with a goodness-of-fit probability, and least absolute deviations criterion with Pearson's linear correlation coefficient. 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 Results We showed that fluctuations are not attributable to random noise and/or experimental errors, evidencing a memory effect quantifiable by the slope of the DI = f(dilution) straight line. For all experiments, correlation coefficients were found to lie above 0.9999, against 0.999 for random noise. The discrimination between experimental slopes and slopes associated with random noise data was very good at a five-sigma level of confidence (i.e. probability 3 × 10−7). Discrimination between experimental slopes at a five-sigma level was possible in most cases, with three exceptions: gelsemium aqua pura v gelsemium dilution (four-sigma); copper aqua pura v gelsemium aqua pura (four-sigma) and copper simple dilution v gelsemium simple dilution (three-sigma). All potentized samples show very good discrimination (at least nine-sigma level) against aqua pura, lactose or simple dilution. It was possible to transform the associated relaxation times into a molecular rotational correlation time τc and an average spin–spin distance d. Our experiments thus point to a considerable slowing down of molecular movements (τc > 1300 ps or T = 224–225 K) around water molecules up to a distance of 3.7 Å, values. It was also possible to rule out other possible mechanisms of relaxation (diffusive motion, 17O-1H relaxation or coupling with the electronic spin, S = 1, of dissolved dioxygen molecules). −7 c c 17 1 −7 c c 17 1 Conclusion There is clear evidence that homeopathic solutions cannot be considered as pure water as commonly assumed. Instead, we have evidenced a clear memory effect upon dilution/potentization of a substance (water, lactose, copper, gelsemium) reflected by different rotational correlation times and average H⋯H distances. A possible explanation for such a memory effect may lie in the formation of mesoscopic water structures around nanoparticles and/or nanobubbles mediated by zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field as suggested by quantum field theories. The existence of an Avogadro's ‘wall’ for homeopathically-prepared medicines is not supported by our data. Rather it appears that all dilutions have a specific material configuration determined by the potentized substance, also by the chemical nature of the containers, and dissolved gases and the electromagnetic environment. This sensitivity of homeopathically-prepared medicines to electromagnetic fields may be amplified by the highly non-linear processing routinely applied in the preparation of homeopathic medicines. Future work is needed in such directions. The time is now ripe for a demystification of the preparation of homeopathic remedies. "
"Background The comprehensive systematic review of randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) in homeopathy requires examination of a study's model validity of homeopathic treatment (MVHT) as well as its risk of bias (extent of reliable evidence). Objective To appraise MVHT in those RCTs of non-individualised homeopathy that an associated investigation had judged as ‘not at high risk of bias’. Design Systematic review. Methods An assessment of MVHT was ascribed to each of 26 eligible RCTs. Another 49 RCTs were ineligible due to their high risk of bias. Main outcome measures MVHT and the prior risk of bias rating per trial were merged to obtain a single overall quality designation (‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’), based on the GRADE principle of downgrading. GRADE GRADE Results The trials were rated as ‘acceptable MVHT’ (N = 9), ‘uncertain MVHT’ (N = 10) and ‘inadequate MVHT’ (N = 7); and, previously, as ‘reliable evidence’ (N = 3) and ‘non-reliable evidence’ (N = 23). The 26 trials were designated overall as: ‘high quality’ (N = 1); ‘moderate quality’ (N = 18); ‘low quality’ (N = 7). Conclusion Of the 26 RCTs of non-individualised homeopathy that were judged ‘not at high risk of bias’, nine have been rated ‘acceptable MVHT’. One of those nine studies was designated ‘high quality’ overall (‘acceptable MVHT’ and ‘reliable evidence’), and is thus currently the only reported RCT that represents best therapeutic practice as well as unbiased evidence in non-individualised homeopathy. As well as minimising risk of bias, new RCTs in this area must aim to maximise MVHT and clarity of reporting. "
"Medicine underwent a major crisis in the 18th century and several approaches, including homeopathy, were formulated to fill the void left by the fall of traditional Galenic medicine. While most of the literature deals with the reasons doctors had to shift to homeopathy, the patients' views became the focus of increasing scholarly attention along the past 20 years. In this article I present and discuss the current knowledge about the socio-demographic characteristics and medical complaints of patients who sought homeopathic care in the early 19th century in both private and institutional settings. The results show that not only patients from the higher and more educated classes sought homeopathic care, but a considerable number of individuals from the middle and lower strata did so too, even though they also had access to conventional hospitals. As to the clinical complaints, the reasons to seek homeopathic care were the typical ones for any general practice or hospital in the period considered. "
"Background A series of different experimental approaches was applied in Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) samples and lactose controls. Experiments were designed to elucidate the effect of zinc trituration and dynamization on physicochemical properties of homeopathic formulations, using lactose as excipient. Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) Zincum metallicum (Zinc met.) Methods Zinc met. potencies (Zinc met 1–3c) were triturated and dynamized using lactose as excipient, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Lactose samples (LAC 1–3c) were also prepared following the same protocol and used as controls. The samples were analyzed structurally by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and thermodynamically by Thermogravimetry (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Zinc met. Zinc met Zinc met. Zinc met Results AAS analysis detected 97.0 % of zinc in the raw material, 0.75 % (Zinc met 1c) and 0.02% (Zinc met 2c). XRD analysis showed that inter-atomic crystalline spacing of lactose was not modified by dynamization. Amorphous and crystalline lactose spheres and particles, respectively, were observed by TEM in all samples, with mean size from 200 to 800 nm. EDX obtained with TEM identified zinc presence throughout the amorphous matter but individualized zinc particles were not observed. SEM images obtained from dynamized samples (LAC 1c and Zinc met 1c) with electron backscattering could not identify zinc metal grains. The dynamization process induced Derivatives of Thermal Gravimetric (DTg) peak modification, which was previously centered near 158°C to lactose, to a range from 140 to 170°C, suggesting the dynamization process modifies the temperature range of water aggregation. Thermal phenomena were analyzed and visualized by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistics. Both indicated that fusion enthalpy of dynamized samples (DynLAC 1-3c; DynZn 1-3c) increased 30.68 J/g in comparison to non-dynamized lactose (LAC; p < 0.05). Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Zinc met Conclusions Our results suggested no structural changes due to the trituration and dynamization process. However, TG and DSC analyses permit the differentiation of dynamized and non-dynamized groups, suggesting the dynamization process induced a significant increase in the degradation heat. These results call for further calorimetric studies with other homeopathic dilutions and other methodologies, to better understand the dynamics of these systems. "
"Prognostic factor research is important as it helps in refining diagnosis, taking clinical and therapeutic decisions, enhances the design and analysis of intervention trials and helps to identify targets for new interventions that aim to modify the course of a disease. Prognostic factor research in homeopathy can be done by applying Bayes' theorem. This paper considers Bayes' theorem; Likelihood Ratio, conditional probability and research in subpopulations of a condition with examples. We analysed the likelihood ratios for 11 homeopathic medicines for the symptom ‘cough’ and other upper respiratory tract symptoms, based on data from the IIPCOS2 study. This yielded useful information since several medicines, including Belladonna, had LR >1 for cough, indicating that cough is not an indication for this medicine. The implications for improving homeopathic prescribing are discussed. Belladonna Belladonna "
"Background High-potency homeopathic remedies, 30c and 200c have enormous dilution factors of 1060 and 10400 respectively. Therefore, the presence of physical entities in them is inconceivable. As a result, their efficacy is highly debated and often dismissed as a placebo. Despite several hypotheses postulated to explain the claimed homeopathic efficacy, none have satisfactorily answered the qualms of the sceptics. Against all beliefs and principles of conventional dilution, we have shown that nanoparticles (NPs) of the starting metals are unequivocally found in the 30c and 200c remedies at concentrations of a few pg/ml. In this paper, our aim was to answer the important question of whether such negligible metal concentrations elicit a biological response. 60 400 60 400 Methods Metal-based homeopathic medicines (30c and 200c) were analysed at doses between 0.003%v/v and 10%v/v in in-vitro HepG2 cell-line. Upon treatment, cell response was estimated by MTT assay, FACS and total intracellular protein. Experiments were performed to discern whether the hormesis was a cell-activation or a proliferation effect. in-vitro in-vitro Results Remedies at doses containing a few femtograms/ml levels of the starting metals induced a proliferation-independent hormetic activation by increasing the intracellular protein synthesis. The metal concentrations (at fg/ml) were a billion-fold lower than the studies with synthetic NPs (at μg/ml). Further, we also highlight a few plausible mechanisms initiating a hormetic response at a billion-fold lower dose. Conclusions Hormetic activation has been shown for the first time with standard homeopathic high-potency remedies. These findings should have a profound effect in understanding these extreme dilutions from a biological perspective. "
"Cavitation in agitated liquids has been discussed for over five decades as a phenomenon that could play a role in the appearance of structural changes in the solvent of potentised dilutions. However, its lack of specificity as well as the absence of experimental confirmation have so far confined the idea to theory. The light emission associated with cavitational bubble collapse can be used to detect and study cavitation in fluids. The phenomenon has been extensively studied when driven by ultrasound, where it is called sonoluminescence. Sonoluminescence spectra reflect extremely high temperature and pressure in the collapsing bubbles and are parameter sensitive. This article tries to examine whether, despite objections and difficulties, the detection or the study of cavitational luminescence in solutions during potentisation could be useful as a physical tool in high dilution research.

"Background A previous study reported a significant statistical interaction between experiment date and treatment effect of Argentum nitricum 14x–30x on the growth rate of duckweed (Lemna gibba L.). The aim of the present study was to investigate the stability of the test system and intra-laboratory reproducibility of the effects found. Argentum nitricum Lemna gibba Argentum nitricum Lemna gibba Methods Duckweed was treated with A. nitricum potencies (14x–30x) as well as succussed and unsuccussed water controls. The outcome parameter area-related growth rate for day 0–7 was determined by a computerised image analysis system in two series of independent randomised and blinded experiments. Systematic negative control (SNC) experiments were carried out to investigate test system stability. Statistical analysis was performed with full two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and protected Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. A. nitricum A. nitricum Results In the first repetition series we found a significant treatment effect (p = 0.016), while in the second series no effect was observed. The negative control experiments showed that the experimental system was stable. An a posteriori subgroup analysis concerning gibbosity revealed the importance of this growth state of L. gibba for successful reproduction of the statistically significant interaction in the original study; flat: no interaction (p = 0.762); slight gibbosity: no interaction (p = 0.356); medium gibbosity: significant interaction (p = 0.031), high gibbosity: highly significant interaction (p = 0.005). a posteriori L. gibba a posteriori L. gibba Conclusions With the original study design (disregarding gibbosity status of L. gibba) results of the original study could not be reproduced sensu stricto. We conclude that the growth state gibbosity is crucial for successful reproduction of the original study. Different physiological states of the test organisms used for bioassays for homeopathic basic research must carefully be considered. L. gibba sensu stricto. L. gibba sensu stricto. "
"Objective This study investigated the effect of two different follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparations (diluted/dynamised and diluted) on the in vitro development and steroid production (estradiol, progesterone and testosterone) of isolated porcine preantral follicle after in vitro culture. in vitro in vitro in vitro in vitro Methods Secondary follicles were cultured in Alpha Minimum Essential Medium (α-MEM+) supplemented with grain ethanol (AL – 0.2%, v/v), diluted/dynamised FSH (rFSH 6cH – 0.05 fg/mL) or diluted-only FSH (1.5 ng/mL) for 4 days. Follicle development was evaluated on the basis of follicular growth, morphology and hormone production. + + Results The percentage of follicular integrity and extrusion were not affected by the treatments after culture. For all treatments, follicular diameter increased significantly from Day 0 to Day 4. On Day 2 of culture, the estradiol production was significantly higher in AL and diluted-only FSH treatments compared with diluted/dynamised FSH. However, diluted/dynamised FSH showed a significantly higher progesterone production on Day 2. Only on Day 4, the testosterone production was higher in the AL than diluted-only FSH treatments, but similar to diluted/dynamised FSH treatment. Except for diluted/dynamised FSH treatment, progesterone production increased (P < 0.05) from Day 2 to Day 4; only for AL treatment, a significant increase of testosterone production was observed during culture. Conclusion Compared to control the diluted/dynamised FSH addition increased progesterone production but decreased the estradiol production after in vitro culture of isolated porcine preantral follicles. Taken together the results suggest that at least for progesterone production the mechanism of action of diluted/dynamised FSH differs from its vehicle. in vitro in vitro "
"Introduction Alternative and complementary therapy systems, such as homeopathy, have long been used around the world. Since 1995 homeopathy has been officially recognized in Europe as a system of medicine or a medical specialty. Portuguese community pharmacists have long-standing experience with homeopathic products. By contrast, healthcare professionals in Turkey are less experienced with homeopathic practice although there is a new regulatory setting in place. There are a limited number of studies addressing pharmacists' role within the homeopathic system. Aim To investigate the attitudes (knowledge, feelings and behaviour) of experienced Portuguese pharmacy practitioners who deal with homeopathy, and thus to inform Turkish pharmacy practice and policy on homeopathy-related success factors. Methods A qualitative cross-sectional design was followed, using semi-structured and face-to-face individual interviews with purposively selected Portuguese pharmacists experienced with homeopathic medicines. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and the transcriptions imported into QSR NVivo v10 software for qualitative coding and analysis. Using a thematic content approach, the extracted codes were grouped and indexed by recurrent themes through a reflective procedure and constant comparison. Results & discussion Six general themes emerged, the most relevant being participants' feelings of gratitude for the ability to work in homeopathy; other themes were a helpful regulatory body, clear practice boundaries, scientific support and product quality assurance. Specialized homeopathic education was considered the most important factor for success. This was related to patients' positive perceptions and acceptance, suggesting an increase in public awareness through the pharmacy network. Conclusions Portuguese pharmacists' attitudes towards their homeopathic practices highlighted the key elements for success in a field that is usually distant from traditional pharmaceutical education and practice. The present findings provide guidance for Turkish pharmacists willing to expand their professional scope and to embrace complementary medicines. "
"Zinc is an important metal in body homeostasis. Zinc in soluble form (Zn2+) and homeopathic Zincum metallicum were tested in macrophages and astrocytes in order to investigate its potential toxic or therapeutic effects. We evaluated cell viability (WST assay), cytokine production such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and nitric oxide release by Griess reaction. The effect of zinc-depletion and high zinc pre-treatments on the cell adaptation capability was also investigated. In THP-1 macrophage cell line and in human primary macrophages, Zn2+ at sub-toxic doses (30 μM) caused stimulation of TNF-α and IL-10 with different dynamics reaching the maximum peak at the zinc concentration 100 μM, before the cell death. Highest doses (300 μM) impaired dramatically cell vitality. Similar effects on cell viability were obtained also in C6 astrocytes, where Zn2+ slightly increased the nitric oxide release only in cells activated by one of the pro-inflammatory stimuli used in our cellular model (interferon gamma plus TNF-α). Zinc depletion markedly reduced IL-10 production and cell viability. Zincum metallicum did not cause toxicity in any cell type and showed some small stimulation in WST assay that was statistically significant in a few experimental conditions. 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ Zincum metallicum 2+ 2+ Zincum metallicum "
"Introduction Zinc is an essential trace element necessary for life. Traditional and complementary medicines use zinc-based formulations to treat different classes of diseases. Basic research on homeopathic preparations of zinc are rare and there are a few published clinical cases describing its effects on patients. The use of cell-based models in drug screening is a reliable source of evidence. Methods We sought to investigate experimental end-points using cell-based models to determine the effects of dilutions of Zincum metallicum prepared according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and melanoma B16-F10 cell lines were cultured according to standard procedures. Cells were treated with either 5c, 6c or 30c Zincum metallicum and control cells with its respective vehicle (5c, 6c, or 30c Lactose). Macrophage activation by CD54 immunolabeling and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) using DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) were detected by flow cytometry. Phagocytic capacity (endocytic index) was quantified by light microscopy. Features of melanoma cells were analyzed by colorimetric assays to determine melanin content and cell proliferation rate. All obtained data were submitted to normality test followed by statistical analysis. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Results Zincum metallicum 6c shifted high ROS-producing macrophages to a low ROS-producing phenotype. Macrophage CD54 expression was increased by Zincum metallicum 5c. No changes in endocytic index were observed. Melanoma cells were not affected by any treatment we tested. Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Zincum metallicum Conclusions Differing responses and non-linearity were found on macrophages challenged with Zincum metallicum at high dilutions. No changes in melanoma cells were observed. Customised assays using target cells can be useful to investigate high-dilution effects. Other cell types and conditions should be explored.

"Aim To systematically review surveys of 12-month prevalence of homeopathy use by the general population worldwide. Methods Studies were identified via database searches to October 2015. Study quality was assessed using a six-item tool. All estimates were in the context of a survey which also reported prevalence of any complementary and alternative medicine use. Results A total of 36 surveys were included. Of these, 67% met four of six quality criteria. Twelve-month prevalence of treatment by a homeopath was reported in 24 surveys of adults (median 1.5%, range 0.2–8.2%). Estimates for children were similar to those for adults. Rates in the USA, UK, Australia and Canada all ranged from 0.2% to 2.9% and remained stable over the years surveyed (1986–2012). Twelve-month prevalence of all use of homeopathy (purchase of over-the-counter homeopathic medicines and treatment by a homeopath) was reported in 10 surveys of adults (median 3.9%, range 0.7–9.8%) while a further 11 surveys which did not define the type of homeopathy use reported similar data. Rates in the USA and Australia ranged from 1.7% to 4.4% and remained stable over the years surveyed. The highest use was reported by a survey in Switzerland where homeopathy is covered by mandatory health insurance. Conclusions This review summarises 12-month prevalence of homeopathy use from surveys conducted in eleven countries (USA, UK, Australia, Israel, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, South Korea, Japan and Singapore). Each year a small but significant percentage of these general populations use homeopathy. This includes visits to homeopaths as well as purchase of over-the-counter homeopathic medicines. "
"In the present study, we investigated the experimental basis for the indications of homeopathic drug Zincum metallicum. The current body of knowledge about Zinc met has a core composed of pathogenetic and clinical data collected in the 19th century surrounded by layers of clinical observations reported over time. In the description, we prioritized poorly known sources, especially the ones that were never translated from the original German. We also performed quantitative and statistical analysis of repertory data. Through a literature survey and a call to practicing homeopathic doctors from many countries, we were able to put together a relevant case-series that represents homeopathic indications of Zinc.

"Objective Glycaemic goals are not achieved in most patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially in those with long disease duration and taking multiple oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD). We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of individualized homeopathic treatment in glycaemic control. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting At least 6 months of individualized homeopathic treatment at a private homeopathic centre in Hong Kong. Participants Twenty-seven adults aged 37–84 years were treated with individualized homeopathic remedies between 2012 and 2015. Published data on 40 T2DM patients under standard conventional treatment in Hong Kong were used as a control. Main outcome measure Change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 12-month or the last follow-up, whichever is earlier. Results Compared with the conventional treatment only group, the homeopathy group had higher baseline FPG (p = 0.044), and more patients had a long (>20 years) duration of diabetes (p = 0.006), and a history of cardiac events (p = 0.022). The mean difference in FPG in the homeopathy group was significantly greater than in the control after 12 months: −2.24 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: −3.47 to −1.01) vs 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI: −1.72 to 2.04), p = 0.001. The mean difference in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also significantly greater, −1.11% (95% CI: −2.17 to −0.05) vs 0.08% (95% CI: −1.37 to 1.53), p = 0.046. Poorer baseline glycaemic control was associated with better outcome (r = −0.750, p < 0.001), but not the duration of diabetes (r = 0.058, p = 0.772). The improvement was robust to sensitivity analyses. p p p p p p p p p p p p p p Conclusion Individualized homeopathic treatment was associated with better glycaemic control compared with standard conventional treatment alone.

"In previous articles, a description of ‘unconventional’ experiments (e.g. in vitro or clinical studies based on high dilutions, ‘memory of water’ or homeopathy) using quantum-like probability was proposed. Because the mathematical formulations of quantum logic are frequently an obstacle for physicians and biologists, a modified modeling that rests on classical probability is described in the present article. This modeling is inspired from a relational interpretation of quantum physics that applies not only to microscopic objects, but also to macroscopic structures, including experimental devices and observers. In this framework, any outcome of an experiment is not an absolute property of the observed system as usually considered but is expressed relatively to an observer. A team of interacting observers is thus described from an external view point based on two principles: the outcomes of experiments are expressed relatively to each observer and the observers agree on outcomes when they interact with each other. If probability fluctuations are also taken into account, correlations between ‘expected’ and observed outcomes emerge. Moreover, quantum-like correlations are predicted in experiments with local blind design but not with centralized blind design. No assumption on ‘memory’ or other physical modification of water is necessary in the present description although such hypotheses cannot be formally discarded. in vitro In conclusion, a simple modeling of ‘unconventional’ experiments based on classical probability is now available and its predictions can be tested. The underlying concepts are sufficiently intuitive to be spread into the homeopathy community and beyond. It is hoped that this modeling will encourage new studies with optimized designs for in vitro experiments and clinical trials. in vitro in vitro in vitro "
"Introduction Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of solvatochromic dyes for investigating the physical chemistry of homeopathic potencies. Results Following examination of this class of dyes in organic solvents, results obtained using the positively solvatochromic dye Bis-dimethylaminofuchsone (BDF) in aqueous solution are now reported. Spectral changes observed with this dye in the presence of potencies are both substantial and reproducible. Studies across a wide range of pH values reveal an unusual pH dependence for the dye's interaction with homeopathic potencies. Results indicate potency enhances dye protonation at pH values below c. 7.0, whilst protecting the dye from attack by hydroxyl ions above c. pH 7.5. Conclusion A possible explanation for these observations is offered in terms of a potency – induced electron density shift in BDF. The interaction of homeopathic potencies with solvatochromic dyes, particularly BDF, points towards a possible physico-chemical model for the nature of potencies, how they may be interacting with this class of dyes, and moreover how their biological effects may be mediated.

"Background Several recent studies reported the capability of high diluted homeopathic medicines to modulate gene expression in cell cultures. In line with these studies, we examined whether ultra-high dilutions (30C and 200C) of sodium butyrate (SB) can affect the expression levels of genes involved in acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Methods Cell viability was evaluated using a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The expression levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 genes were determined by real-time PCR assay. Results Exposure to both 30C and 200C during 48 h led to a significant decrease of the level of expression of TNF-α gene, while expression of IL-2 gene was increased when exposed to 30C, and expression of IL-10 gene was decreased when exposed to 200C. No changes in expression levels of all genes studied were observed in cells treated with both 30C and 200C remedies of SB during the 24 h. Conclusion Observed changes in gene expression levels after exposure to 30C and 200C remedies of SB during 48 h suggest that extremely low concentrations of this agent can modulate the transcriptome of HEK 293 cells. These results are in line with findings from other studies confirming the ability of homeopathic remedies to modulate gene expression in cell cultures. "
"Background The popularity of homeopathy is seemingly at odds with the scientific controversy over its effectiveness. Several studies have reported on effectiveness of clinical homeopathy, but few studies have been conducted on practices and perceptions of homeopaths, and none in New Zealand (NZ). To address this gap, this paper reports findings from the first national survey examining the characteristics, perceptions and experiences of NZ-based homeopaths regarding a wide range of issues relating to their role and practice. There were 176 homeopaths in NZ at the time of this survey, who were members of a voluntary register (The New Zealand Council of Homeopaths), homeopaths are not statutorily registered in NZ. Methods A 65 question, online survey was sent to homeopathic practitioners via their professional associations. A total of 176 homeopaths were invited to participate. Of these 176, 57 (32%) responded. Results The majority of homeopaths were female (93%). Twelve percent were under 45 years and 20% over 55 years. Most (85%) had qualification in homeopathy of diploma or certificate level and most (66%) were engaged in part-time practice. Mean year of experience was 12.6 and mean caseload per month was 25. 90% considered research useful to validate practice, while 88% considered that it impacted on practice, although only 48% had skills to interpret research papers. There was an association between skills to interpret research and its impact on practice (p = 0.038). The majority (87%) were in favour of registration, with a statistically significant association between attitudes to registration and age (p = 0.027), the older homeopaths being more in favour. Most (68%) were in favour of integration with conventional practitioners and many referred to conventional practitioners (mean referrals per annum to GPs = 57 and midwives = 30). Homeopaths assessed their contribution to New Zealand Ministry of Health objectives as significant, with 77% perceiving that they improved nutrition, 75% increasing physical activity and 63% reducing smoking. Conclusion These findings enable greater understanding of the way in which homeopaths practice in New Zealand and how they perceive their role in health care. The findings potentially assist communication between homeopaths and other health professionals. There is a need to further investigate homeopaths' practices and perceptions in NZ. "
"Background Mortality from vibriosis in mollusk production is attributed to pathogenic bacteria, particularly Vibrio alginolyticus. Use of increasingly potent antibiotics has led to bacterial resistance and increased pathogenicity. Alternatives in sanitation, safety, and environmental sustainability are currently under analysis. To-date, homeopathy has been investigated in aquaculture of freshwater fish, but not in marine mollusks. The effect of the homeopathic complexes in the growth, survival, and immune response of the Catarina scallop Argopecten ventricosus were assessed. Vibrio alginolyticus Argopecten ventricosus Vibrio alginolyticus Argopecten ventricosus Methods A bioassay to assess the potential of homeopathy in improving cultivation of juvenile A. ventricosus was conducted for 21 days, with a final challenge of 120 h with V. alginolyticus. The experimental design included two homeopathic formulas The homeopathic complex Passival, consisting of Passiflora incarnata 30 CH, Valeriana officinalis 30 CH, Ignatia amara 30 CH and Zincum valerianicum 30 CH plus Phosphoricum acid 30 CH (treatment TH1) or Silicea terra 30 CH (TH2), two antibiotics (ampicillin = AMP, oxytetracycline = OXY), and two reference treatments (without homeopathic or antibiotic treatment = CTRL, ethanol 30° GL = ETH). Additionally, a negative control CTRL− (untreated/uninfected) is included in the challenge test. Juvenile scallops (4.14 ± 0.06 mm, 13.33 mg wet weight) were cultivated in 4 L tanks provided with aerated, filtered (1 μm), and UV-sterilized seawater that was changed every third day. They were fed a blend of the microalgae Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans (150,000 cells mL−1 twice a day). All treatments were directly added to the tank water and then 500 mL challenge units were inoculated with 1 × 107 CFU/mL (LD50) of V. alginolyticus. A. ventricosus V. alginolyticus Isochrysis galbana Chaetoceros calcitrans −1 7 50 V. alginolyticus A. ventricosus V. alginolyticus Isochrysis galbana Chaetoceros calcitrans −1 7 50 V. alginolyticus Results Juveniles grew significantly larger and faster in height and weight with TH2 compared to the ETH and CTRL (P < 0.05, ANOVA). Higher concentrations of proteins occurred in scallops exposed to TH2 (160.57 ± 7.79 mg g−1), compared to other treatments and reference treatments. Higher survival rate during the challenge bioassay occurred with TH1 (85%), compared to AMP (53%), OXY (30%), and CTRL (0%), and superoxide dismutase (P < 0.05) was significantly higher in scallops treated with TH1, compared to other treatments and reference treatments. P −1 P P −1 P Conclusions Homeopathic treatments improved growth and survival and enhanced survival against V. alginolyticus in juvenile A. ventricosus. This suggests that homeopathy is a viable treatment for this mollusk to reduce use of antibiotics in scallops and its progressive increase in pathogenicity in mollusk hatcheries.

"Background Climacteric is associated with both depression and metabolic dysregulation. Scarce evidence suggests that metabolic dysregulation may predict poor response to conventional antidepressants. Response to depression treatment has not been studied in homeopathic medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic disorders in depressed climacteric women treated with homeopathic medicines, fluoxetine or placebo, and if these alterations have any association with response to depression treatment. Methods One hundred and thirty-three Mexican women (40–65 years) with depression, enrolled in the HOMDEP-MENOP study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, three-arm trial with a 6 week follow-up, underwent a complete medical history and clinical examination. Metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline. Association between baseline metabolic parameters and response to depression treatment was analyzed with bivariate analysis in the three groups. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Metabolic parameters were considered for inclusion in the logistic regression model if they had a statistically significant relationship with response rate on bivariate analysis at p < 0.05 or if they were clinically relevant. Results Overall combined prevalence (obesity and overweight) was 86.5%; 52.3% had hypertriglyceridemia; 44.7% hypercholesterolemia; 46.7% insulin resistance; and 16% subclinical hypothyroidism. There was no statistically significant association between dyslipidemia, overweight, or insulin resistance and non-response in the homeopathy group [OR (95% CI) 1.57 (0.46–5.32), p = 0.467; 0.37 (0.003–1.11), p = 0.059; 0.67 (0.16–2.7), p = 0.579, respectively]. Conclusion Metabolic dysregulation was not significantly associated with response to depression treatment in depressed climacteric women treated with individualized homeopathic treatment (IHT), fluoxetine or placebo. Due to the high prevalence of metabolic disorders and its relationship with depression in the climacteric, further investigation should be focused on whether individualized prescriptions based on classical homeopathy for depressed climacteric women have an effect on metabolic parameters, and/or if treating the metabolic disorders at the same time could lead to higher response rates.

"Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate whether the number of succussion strokes applied after each dilution step when preparing the homeopathic treatments influences the effectiveness of ultra-high-diluted (UHD) arsenic trioxide at the 45th decimal dilution/dynamization (As2O3 45x). 2 3 2 3 Design Wheat seeds, previously stressed with ponderal As2O3, were treated with: As2O3 45x, H2O 45x (dynamized control), or pure water (negative control). The succussion was done manually, and various succussion durations (numbers of strokes) were tested for each treatment. Treatment effectiveness was tested blind using the in vitro germination test and the droplet evaporation method (DEM). Data were processed by the Poisson test (germination test) and by two-way analysis of variance (DEM). 2 3 2 3 2 in vitro 2 3 2 3 2 in vitro Main outcome measures We evaluated both the in vitro germination rate, by counting the non-germinated seeds, and the complexity of polycrystalline structures (PCS) (local connected fractal dimension (LCFD)) obtained by evaporating leakage droplets from stressed seeds that had been watered with the different treatments. in vitro in vitro Results We observed a highly significant increase in germination rate when the number of strokes (NS) was ≥32 for both As2O3 45x and H2O 45x, and a significant increase in the LCFD of PCS for As2O3 45x when the NS was ≥32 and for H2O 45x when it was 70. S 2 3 2 2 3 S 2 S 2 3 2 2 3 S 2 Conclusions Both experimental approaches showed increased effectiveness for treatments prepared with a higher number of succussion strokes.

"Objective To test a methodology to evaluate, at population level, the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment through standard objective public health indicators. Methods and settings Indicators of hospitalization and drug use were obtained from the Health Statistical Documentation System of Tuscany for two homeopathic centers in the Local Health Authority of Pisa, Italy. We compared homeopathic users with the general population in the same area and by comparing patients before and after homeopathic treatment. Results The homeopathic patients used less drugs than the reference population, this effect was more evident for patients with repeated homeopathic consultations. A significant decrease in drug use was found on comparing the same patients before and after homeopathic treatment. Hospitalization indicators tended to favour patients who had received homeopathic treatment but were not always statistically significant. Conclusions This paper demonstrates a new methodological approach to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic modality, without ad-hoc clinical trials. This methodology can be used by public health institutions in which non-conventional medicines are integrated into the public health care system. ad-hoc ad-hoc "
"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by recurrent blistering as a result of even minor traction of epithelial lined tissues, most remarkably the skin. Associated morbidity is serious for all patients affected due to the presence of large areas of denudated skin thus susceptible to infection. There is currently no available treatment in conventional medicine. This article reports the case of 3 children successfully treated with individualized homeopathic medicines. "
"The HomBRex database includes details of about 1500 basic research experiments in homeopathy. A general overview on the experiments listed in the HomBRex database is presented, focusing on high dilutions and the different settings in which those were used. Though often criticised, many experiments with remedies diluted beyond Avogadro’s number demonstrate specific effects. A total of 830 experiments employing high potencies was found; in 745 experiments of these (90%), at least one positive result was reported. Animals represent the most often used model system (n = 371), followed by plants (n = 201), human material (n = 92), bacteria and viruses (n = 37) and fungi (n = 32). Arsenicum album (Ars.) is the substance most often applied (n = 101), followed by Sulphur (Sulph.) and Thuja (Thuj.) (n = 65 and 48, respectively). Proving, prophylactic and therapeutic study designs have all been used and appear appropriate for homeopathy basic research using high dilutions. The basic research data set to support specific effects unique to high dilutions and opposite to those observed with low dilutions is, to date, insufficient. n n n n n Arsenicum album Ars. n Sulphur Sulph.

"Background Experimental research on the effects of homeopathic treatments on impaired plants was last reviewed in 1990. Objectives To compile a systematic review of the existing literature on basic research in homeopathy with abiotically stressed plants using predefined criteria. Methods The literature search was carried out on publications that reported experiments on homeopathy using abiotically stressed whole plants, seeds, plant parts and cells from 1920 to 2010. Outcomes had to be measured by established procedures and statistically evaluated. Using of a Manuscript Information Score (MIS) we identified those publications that provided sufficient information for proper interpretation (MIS ≥ 5). A further evaluation was based on the use of adequate controls to investigate specific effects of homeopathic preparations and on the use of systematic negative control experiments. Results A total of 34 publications with abiotically stressed plants was identified, published between 1965 and 2010. The 34 publications described a total of 37 experimental studies. Twenty-two studies included statistics, 13 had a MIS ≥ 5, 8 were identified with adequate controls and 4 with negative control experiments. Significant and reproducible effects with decimal and centesimal potencies were found, including dilution levels beyond Avogadro’s number. One experimental model was independently assessed by another research team and yielded inverted results compared to the original trial. Conclusions Abiotically stressed plant models seem to be a useful approach to investigate homeopathic basic research questions, but more experimentation and especially more independent replication trials are needed. Systematic negative control experiments should be implemented on a routine basis to exclude false-positive results. "
"Analytical time-dependent functions describing the change of the concentration of the solvent S(t) and the homeopathic active substance A(t) during decimal and centesimal dilution are derived. The function S(t) is a special case of the West–Brown–Enquist curve describing ontogenic growth, the increase in concentration of the solvent during potentization resembles the growth of biological systems. It is demonstrated that the macroscopic S(t) function is the ground state solution of the microscopic non-local Horodecki–Feinberg equation for the time-dependent Hulthèn potential at the critical screening. In consequence potentization belongs to the class of quasi-quantum phenomena playing an important role both in biological systems and homeopathy. A comparison of the results predicted by the model proposed with the results of experiments on delayed luminescence of a homeopathic medicine is made. "
"Hyperthyroidism is a frequent veterinary problem, particularly in elderly cats. Homeopathic treatment and other integrative modalities were provided for four hyperthyroid cats whose owners did not want conventional treatment. Symptomatic homeopathic treatment with Thyroidinum was helpful in one cat. All cats were prescribed an appropriate individualized homeopathic remedy. All four cats showed resolution of clinical signs; three attained normal thyroid hormone levels. Three cats later received acupuncture and/or herbal medicines; two cats later received symptomatic homeopathic remedies. Two cats are thriving after over 3.5 and 4.25 years of treatment; two were euthanized for unrelated problems after 3 and 4 years of treatment. Homeopathic and complementary therapies avoid the potential side effects of methimazole and surgical thyroidectomy, they are less costly than radioactive iodine treatment, and they provide an option for clients who decline conventional therapies.

"Introduction Homeopathic pathogenetic trials usually rely on symptom self report measures. Adding objective biomarkers could enhance detection of subtle initial remedy effects. The present feasibility study examined electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of repeated olfactory administration of two polycrest remedies. Methods College student volunteers (ages 18–30, both sexes) from an introductory psychology course were screened for good health and relatively elevated Sulphur or Pulsatilla symptom scores on the Homeopathic Constitutional Type Questionnaire (CTQ). Subjects underwent a series of 3 once-weekly double-blind sessions during which they repeatedly sniffed the remedy matched to their CTQ type and solvent controls. Each remedy was given in a 6c, 12c, and 30c potency, one potency per week, in randomly assigned order. Solvent controls included both plain distilled water and a water–ethanol (95%) solution. All sniff test solutions were further diluted just prior to laboratory sessions (0.5 ml test solution in 150 ml distilled water). Within a session, remedies and control solvents were administered via 2-s sniffs (8 sniffs of each of 4 different succussion levels for the potency in randomized order). Primary outcome variable was relative EEG power (alpha 1 8–10 Hz; alpha 2 10–12 Hz) averaged over 19 electrode sites, including all succussions for a given potency. Sulphur Pulsatilla Sulphur Pulsatilla Results Mixed-effect models revealed significant main effects for remedy type (Sulphur > Pulsatilla) in both alpha bands, controlling for gender, baseline resting EEG alpha, and solvent control responses. Additional analyses showed significant nonlinear interactions between dilution and time (weekly session) in alpha 2 for both remedies and alpha 1 for Sulphur. Sulphur Pulsatilla Sulphur Sulphur Pulsatilla Sulphur Conclusion EEG alpha offers an objective biomarker of remedy effects for future studies and potential method for distinguishing time-dependent effects of specific remedies and remedy potencies from one another.

"Background The homeopathic method is based on the application of the principle of therapeutic similitude (similia similibus curentur), using medicines that cause effects similar to the symptoms of disease in order to stimulate the reaction of the organism against disturbances. Such vital, homeostatic or paradoxical reaction of the organism can be scientifically explained on the basis of the rebound effect of modern drugs. Aims This article presents the conclusion of a study aiming at a method to use modern drugs with homeopathic criteria. Methods Adverse effects as catalogued in United States Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information Drug monographs were collected. Results A homeopathic materia medica and repertory comprising 1251 modern drugs to be employed according to the principle of therapeutic similitude was developed. Conclusion Besides supplying a basis for homeopathy as a medical rationale related to scientific pharmacology, this study makes available a method that may broaden the scope of intervention of homeopathy in present day diseases.

"Background Repertory mistakes in modern homeopathy have been pointed out since the early years after the publication of the sixth edition of Kent’s repertory. A structural error of many current repertories is the use of Kent’s repertory as a basic information source. ‘Fear of ghosts’ is widely considered to be a symptom of Lycopodium clavatum by the homeopathic community. Lycopodium clavatum Lycopodium clavatum Objectives To demonstrate that the source of ‘fear of ghosts’ in Lycopodium clavatum was an inaccurate translation, that has been spread by secondary sources and to review Hahnemann’s conception and efforts towards a reliable repertory. Lycopodium clavatum Lycopodium clavatum Results The symptom ‘fear of ghosts’ does not exist in the primary source, being the product of a misunderstanding of the English translation of Hahnemann’s original record, ‘fear of frightful imaginary images’. Hahnemann’s efforts to compile a reliable and complete dictionary of Materia Medica were also briefly presented, as well as Rückert’s repertory, which, in addition to collating and classifying symptoms in alphabetical rubrics and sub-rubrics, displayed them completely, as registered in primary sources. Materia Medica Materia Medica Conclusion The misunderstanding about ‘fear of ghosts’ in Lycopodium clavatum exemplifies how distant current homeopathic information is from its primary sources and from Hahnemann’s ideal of a symptom-lexicon. In spite of its technical limitations, Rückert’s repertory, which was strongly recommended by Hahnemann, can be considered as a template for new repertories based on primary sources.

"Background Ultra High Dilutions (UHD) are diluted beyond the Avogadro limit with dynamization (dilution with succussion). The process of anuran amphibian metamorphosis is controlled by thyroid hormones, including the resorption of the tadpole tail. Methods A randomized and blinded study was performed to investigate the influence of triiodothyronine (T3) 5 · 10−24 M (10cH) on apoptosis induced by T3 100 nM in Rana catesbeiana tadpoles’ tail tips, in vitro. Explants were randomized to three groups: control: no T3 in pharmacological or UHD dose; test: T3 100 nM and challenged with T3 10cH (UHD); positive control: T3 100 nM, treated with unsuccussed ethanol. The apoptotic index and the area of explants of test and control groups at the first and final day of the experiment were compared by t-test. −24 Rana catesbeiana in vitro t −24 Rana catesbeiana in vitro t Results There was no difference in tail tip area between test and control groups, but a significantly higher (p < 0.01) index of apoptosis in explants of the test group. p p Conclusion This data suggest that T3 10cH modifies the effect of T3 at pharmacological dose, opening new perspectives for further studies and investigation of the dose–effect curve.

"Objective To evaluate the effects of different forms of administration of the blood trypomastigotes biotherapy 7dH in mice experimentally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Trypanosoma cruzi Trypanosoma cruzi Material and methods Male swiss mice were inoculated with 1400 blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi and allocated into 5 treatment groups: IC (distilled water); TCBZ (benznidazole); TBA7dH (biotherapy 7dH 20 days after infection); TBB7dH7 (biotherapy 7dH seven days before infection); TBB7dH30 (biotherapy 7dH 30 days before infection). Parasitological parameters assessed included pre-patent and patent periods, parasitemia peak, total parasitemia, mortality and survival rates. Cure index was obtained by fresh blood examination, hemoculture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). T. cruzi 7dH 7dH 7dH T. cruzi 7dH 7dH 7dH Results The TBB7dH7 group showed a reduction in parasitemia peak, parasitemia area under the curve and total parasitemia. TBB7dH30 showed a tendency to increased pre-patent and survival periods, peak parasitemia was increased without increased total parasitemia. TBA7dH did not present significant alterations in the parasitological parameters analyzed. 7dH 7dH 7dH 7dH 7dH 7dH Conclusions Biotherapy 7dH given before infection (7 or 30 days) produces different effects suggesting modulation of the host’s immune system. The effects range from reduced parasitemia to its effective increase. The use of biotherapy to treat T. cruzi infection including dose, potency and schedule deserves further investigation.

"Introduction Poisoning due to lead and its compounds has short and long-term effects primarily on the nervous, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, renal and reproductive systems. It can manifest in acute or chronic symptoms. Measuring serum concentration is the primary method for diagnosing and monitoring exposed workers. Presently, elevated lead levels are treated by drugs whose effectiveness is contested on various fronts. Experimental studies suggest that homeopathic preparations may be in controlling blood lead levels in laboratory animals, creating the need for controlled studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these preparations in humans. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of the homeopathic preparation Plumbum metallicum in reducing the blood lead level of workers exposed to this metal. Plumbum metallicum Plumbum metallicum Design Double-blind randomized trial. Setting Workers’ clinic in the Ajax battery plant, which employs 900 workers with varying degrees of lead exposure in Bauru, São Paulo State, Brazil. Subjects 131 workers exposed to lead. Intervention Plumbum metallicum 15cH or placebo, orally for 35 days. Plumbum metallicum placebo Plumbum metallicum placebo Results The percentage of workers who demonstrated a reduction in lead counts by a percentage greater than or equal to 25% following treatment was the same for both groups: 20.3% in the homeopathic groups versus 21% in the control group [Relative Risk (RR) = 0.95, confidential interval (CI) 95%: 0.47–1.92)]. Analysis by intention-to-treat also did not show any difference between the groups: 18.2% in the treated group versus 20% in the placebo group (RR = 0.91, CI 95%: 0.45–1.84). versus versus placebo versus versus placebo Conclusion The homeopathic preparation Plumbum metallicum had no effect, in this study, in terms of reducing serum lead in workers exposed to lead.

"Blisters are skin lesions characterized by accumulation of fluid between the layers of the skin. Their severity varies from the common blisters caused by friction to severe autoimmune and congenital bullous disorders, some of them currently without treatment in conventional medicine or requiring drugs with potentially severe side-effects. This article reports cases of blistering diseases successfully treated with homeopathic medicines, which represent an alternative for the treatment of such disorders. "
"The effects of ultra-low doses (ULDs) of biologically active substances (BASs) (with concentrations of 10−13 M or lower) on biological objects (BOs), such as cells, organisms, etc., and the properties of spin supercurrents in superfluid 3He-B are discussed. It is shown that the effects of ULDs of BASs on biologic objects can be specified by the same set of physical characteristics and described by the same mathematical relations as those used for the specification and description of the properties of spin supercurrents between spin structures in superfluid 3He-B. This is based on the up-to-date physical concepts: 1) the physical vacuum has the properties of superfluid 3He-B; 2) all quantum entities (hence, the BAS and the BO, which consist of such entities) produce spin structures in the physical vacuum. The photon being a quantum entity, the features of the effects of low-intensity electromagnetic radiation on BOs can be explained using the same approach. −13 3 3 3 −13 3 3 3 "
"Objectives To study the anti-asthmatic and anti-anaphylactic activities of Blatta orientalis mother tincture (B. orientalis MT), a homeopathic medicine, in experimental animal models. Blatta orientalis B. orientalis Blatta orientalis B. orientalis Methods The anti-asthmatic activity of B. orientalis MT was studied in the bronchial hyperactivity models, acetylcholine and histamine induced bronchospasm, in guinea pigs. Anti-anaphylactic activity was tested by active and passive anaphylaxis models in rats, anti-eosinophilic activity was tested by milk-induced eosinophilia in mice. B. orientalis B. orientalis Results Significant protection against acetylcholine and histamine aerosol-induced bronchospasm in B. orientalis MT treated guinea pigs was seen. In active and passive anaphylaxis albino rat models significant reduction in mesenteric mast cells degranulation, serum IgE level and eosinophil cell count was observed in the B. orientalis MT treated rat group when compared with the sensitized control rat group. B. orientalis B. orientalis B. orientalis B. orientalis Conclusion These results reveal broad activity of B. orientalis MT. It may have nonselective anti-asthmatic activity. The anti-anaphylactic activity of B. orientalis MT may be due to mast cell stabilization, suppression of IgE and eosinophil cell count. B. orientalis B. orientalis B. orientalis B. orientalis "
"A retrospective quantitative study on dietary references found in medical records of 2753 patients attending consultations from 10/1/1994 to 5/31/2007 was conducted. The symptoms found in the rubrics relating to food and drink aggravation and amelioration, aversion and craving of homeopathic repertories reflect diets at different places and times and do not correspond fully, to contemporary gastronomy. Desires for sweet and spicy foods were statistically more frequent, revealing the prevailing taste for such food among the studied population. Food cravings should be carefully analyzed before considering them as indications for choosing homeopathic therapy, they are less significant than aversions, aggravations and ameliorations. "
"Tuberculosis (TB) has been known since antiquity. In spite of effective antibiotic treatment, it is still a major worldwide public health problem. Endogenous factors are important in the development of active disease. Homeopathic medicines have the potential for immune-modulation and hence to influence endogenous factors in disease. In India, patients with tubercular lymphadenitis (TBLN) often consult homeopaths but such cases are seldom documented. The objective of the present study is to document such experience. A retrospective exploratory study of 25 positively diagnosed cases of TBLN has lead to the development of a homeopathic regime consisting of a patient specific constitutional medicine, one disease specific biotherapy (Tuberculinum) and Silicea 6x as supportive medicine. Homeopathy can be used as a complement to conventional anti tubercular treatment (ATT) with beneficial results. Further validation in controlled trials with immunological markers is required. "
"Objective To test the feasibility of a pragmatic trial design with economic evaluation and nested qualitative study, comparing usual care (UC) with UC plus individualised homeopathy, in children requiring secondary care for asthma. This included recruitment and retention, acceptability of outcome measures patients’ and health professionals’ views and experiences and a power calculation for a definitive trial. Methods In a pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, children on step 2 or above of the British Thoracic Society Asthma Guidelines (BTG) were randomly allocated to UC or UC plus a five visit package of homeopathic care (HC). Outcome measures included the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire, Quality of Life Questionnaire and a resource use questionnaire. Qualitative interviews were used to gain families’ and health professionals’ views and experiences. Results 226 children were identified from hospital clinics and related patient databases. 67 showed an interest in participating, 39 children were randomised, 18 to HC and 21 to UC. Evidence in favour of adjunctive homeopathic treatment was lacking. Economic evaluation suggests that the cost of additional consultations was not offset by the reduced cost of homeopathic remedies and the lower use of primary care by children in the homeopathic group. Qualitative data gave insights into the differing perspectives of families and health care professionals within the research process. Conclusions A future study using this design is not feasible, further investigation of a potential role for homeopathy in asthma management might be better conducted in primary care with children with less severe asthma.

"Background Toxicodendron pubescens P. Mill (Anacardiaceae) known in homeopathy as Rhus toxicodendron (Rhus tox) is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine in homeopathic practice. In this study, Rhus tox in its crude form and homeopathic dilutions (3cH, 6cH, 30cH, 200cH) was evaluated for effects on Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis in rats. Toxicodendron pubescens Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox Toxicodendron pubescens Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox Method We assessed the severity of arthritis through observations including inflammatory lesions, body and organ weight and hematological parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP). Blinded radiological analysis of the affected joints and pain intensity determination was also carried out. Results Rhus tox protected rats from CFA-induced inflammatory lesions, body weight changes and hematological alterations. Rhus tox protected against radiological joint alterations due to arthritis. Arthritic pain scores were also favorably affected by Rhus tox. All the dilutions of Rhus tox including crude form showed anti-arthritic activity. The maximum protective effect was evident in the crude form at 10 mg/kg/day, by mouth. Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Conclusion This study supports claims in the homeopathic literature on the role of Rhus tox and its ultra dilutions in the treatment of arthritis and associated pain. Further study is needed to explain this anti-arthritic effect of Rhus tox. Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox Rhus tox "
"Background Homeopathy is based on the principle of similitude (similia similibus curentur) using medicines that cause effects similar to the symptoms of disease in order to stimulate the reaction of the organism. Such vital, homeostatic or paradoxical reaction of the organism is closely related to rebound effect of drugs. similia similibus curentur similia similibus curentur Method Review of the literature concerning the rebound effects of drugs used to suppress gastric acidity, particularly proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Results The mechanism of action of these effects is discussed. Rebound in terms of clinical symptoms and physiological effects occur in about 40% of people taking PPIs, their timing depends on the half-life of the drug and the adaptation period of the physiological mechanisms involved. The wide use of PPIs may be linked to the rising incidence of carcinoid tumours. Conclusions These findings support Hahnemann’s concept of secondary action of drugs. We are developing a homeopathic materia medica and repertory of modern drugs on the basis of reported rebound effects. "
"Rationale Patients treated with homeopathy may respond to infrequently used or even ‘new’ medicines. But does the introduction of an unlimited number of (new) medicines improve homeopathy? Do new medicines solve old problems? Methods 1. Consensus meetings to evaluate best cases. 2. Patient outcome study in 10 Dutch practices. Results Good cases are scarce for many medicines, random variance is an important source of uncertainty. 50 Medicines are responsible for 72% of all successful prescriptions. There is no difference in effectiveness of frequently and less frequently used medicines. Confirmation bias is found for a few well-known symptom-medicine combinations. Conclusion ‘New’ and infrequently medicines are as effective as ‘old’ frequently used medicines. Improving the use of frequently used medicines is more effective in improving results than seldom used medicines. Large numbers are required and old mistakes should be avoided developing new medicines. A research agenda for improving the use of homeopathic medicines is imperative. "
"Objective To assess the effectiveness of a homeopathic ear drop for treatment of otalgia in children with acute otitis media (AOM). Methods Children with AOM were enrolled in the study at the time of diagnosis and randomized to receive either standard therapy alone or standard therapy plus a homeopathic ear drop solution that was to be used on as needed basis for up to 5 days. Parents of children in both treatment groups rated the severity of 5 AOM symptoms twice daily for 5 days in a symptom diary. A symptom score was computed for each assessment with lower scores denoting less severe symptoms. Parents of children randomized to receive ear drops also recorded information regarding symptoms being treated and response to treatment. Results A total of 119 eligible children were enrolled in the study; symptom diaries were received from 94 (79%). Symptom scores tended to be lower in the group of children receiving ear drops than in those receiving standard therapy alone; these differences were significant at the second and third assessments (P = 0.04 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, the rate of symptom improvement was faster in children in the ear drop group compared with children in standard therapy alone group (P = 0.002). The most common reason for administration of ear drops was ear pain, recorded for 93 doses; improvement was noted after 78.4% of doses for this indication. There were no significant side effects related to use of the ear drops. P P P P P P Conclusions This study suggests that homeopathic ear drops were moderately effective in treating otalgia in children with AOM and may be most effective in the early period after a diagnosis of AOM. Pediatricians and other primary health care providers should consider homeopathic ear drops a useful adjunct to standard therapy. "

"Background Mortality in patients with severe sepsis remains high despite the development of several therapeutic strategies. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether homeopathy is able to influence long-term outcome in critically ill patients suffering from severe sepsis. Methods Seventy patients with severe sepsis received homeopathic treatment (n=35) or placebo (n=35). Five globules in a potency of 200c were given at 12 h interval during the stay at the intensive care unit. Survival after a 30 and 180 days was recorded. n n n n Results Three patients (2 homeopathy, 1 placebo) were excluded from the analyses because of incomplete data. All these patients survived. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, prior conditions, APACHE II score, signs of sepsis, number of organ failures, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors or veno-venous hemofiltration, and laboratory parameters were not significantly different between groups. On day 30, there was non-statistically significantly trend of survival in favour of homeopathy (verum 81.8%, placebo 67.7%, P=0.19). On day 180, survival was statistically significantly higher with verum homeopathy (75.8% vs 50.0%, P=0.043). No adverse effects were observed. P vs P P vs P Conclusions Our data suggest that homeopathic treatment may be an useful additional therapeutic measure with a long-term benefit for severely septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit. A constraint to wider application of this method is the limited number of trained homeopaths. "

"1. A method is described for investigating the possible action of microdoses of mercuric chloride on the hydrolysis of soluble starch with malt diastase. 2 The microdoses of the mercuric chloride used in the latest crucial series carried out in 1946, 1948, and 1952, were what are termed ‘high potencies’ made in accordance with the pharmaceutical method of preparation of drags ordinarily used in the practice of homceotherapy. 3 These microdoses were prepared by separate stages of dilution, the solution at each stage being subjected to mechanical shock. The solutions were, theoretically, ‘dilutions’ of the order of 1 in 10−61 and on present physical theory would not contain any molecules of the original mercuric chloride. −61 −61 4 The difference in rate of hydrolysis between flasks containing starch, diastase, and distilled water (controls) and flasks containing starch, diastase and microdoses of mercuric chloride (tests) were compared colorimetrically by the Spekker absorptiometer, and the frequencies of the differences statistically analysed, as the results obtained showed biological scatter. More than 500 such comparisons were carried out. The differences of means were examined by the Fisher “t” test, the variances tested and Cochrane and Cox’s test applied where indicated. All the series gave a highly significant difference in the rate of hydrolysis between controls and tests, the microdoses stimulating the process. Statistically the significance is shown by the fact that a probability of <0.001 was obtained independently in each of the three years 1946, 1948 and 1952. The control results gave an approximately normal distribution. 5 The distribution, control methods, and accessory control procedures were considered to exclude, as a cause of the effects, adsorption of the original drug and the presence of extraneous contaminants by chance solely in test flasks. The only difference between control and microdose flasks was the addition of microdose, the distilled water being common to both controls and tests. 6 It was concluded that a factor, unidentified, derived from the mercuric chloride used, was present in solutions prepared by serial dilution with mechanical shock which could affect the distilled water diluent, that this change was transferable to subsequent ‘ultra-molecular’ stages of ‘dilution’, and that this factor was the source of the activity in the microdose solutions producing the acceleration of the rate of hydrolysis. 7 In an addendum there is described recent biological work which is also providing evidence of the presence of an active selective factor in ‘high potencies’ derived from Strophanthus sarmentosus by the same methods of dilution with mechanical shock.

"Introduction The peer-review literature contains no controlled clinical research of homeopathy in cats and very little in dogs. Main objective To collect clinical outcomes data systematically from individualised homeopathic treatment of cats and dogs that would help to inform controlled research in feline and canine homeopathy. Methods Twenty-one homeopathic veterinary surgeons recorded data systematically from consecutive feline and canine patients over a 12-month period. Records included: date; patient and owner identity (anonymised); medical problem treated; whether new or follow-up (FU) appointment; chronic or acute condition; owner-assessed clinical outcome (7-point scale, range −3 to +3) compared with first appointment. Results Data from 400 cats comprised a total of 372 individual chronic problems, of which 270 had FU assessment. Data from 1504 dogs comprised a total of 1408 individual chronic problems, of which 1070 had FU assessment. In both species, 22% of FUs in chronic cases received conventional medicines concurrently. In cats, 117 different chronic medical conditions in total were treated with homeopathy. Five of those conditions included ≥20 cases, in which owner-reported outcomes (in decreasing rank order of frequency) were: dermatitis (69.6% patients with +2 or +3 outcome, 0% patients with −2 or −3 outcome); renal failure (57.1%, 14.3%); overgrooming (57.1%, 7.2%); arthritis (80.0%, 0%); hyperthyroidism (66.7%, 0%). In dogs, of 301 different chronic medical conditions treated in total, those most commonly recorded (≥20 cases) were: dermatitis (66.2% with +2 or +3 outcome, 5.4% with −2 or −3 outcome); arthritis (80.2%, 0.8%); pyoderma (75.8%, 0%); colitis (85.2%, 0%); fear (31.6%, 0%); epilepsy (63.6%, 4.5%); otitis externa (72.7%, 0%); diarrhoea (68.2%, 0%); urinary incontinence (73.7%, 0%); aggression (57.1%, 0%); spondylosis (81.0%, 0%); lymphoma (40.0%, 6.7%). Conclusions A programme of controlled research in veterinary homeopathy for these feline and canine conditions is clearly indicated. "
"Homeopathy is controversial because medicines in high potencies such as 30c and 200c involve huge dilution factors (1060 and 10400 respectively) which are many orders of magnitude greater than Avogadro’s number, so that theoretically there should be no measurable remnants of the starting materials. No hypothesis which predicts the retention of properties of starting materials has been proposed nor has any physical entity been shown to exist in these high potency medicines. Using market samples of metal-derived medicines from reputable manufacturers, we have demonstrated for the first time by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction and chemical analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), the presence of physical entities in these extreme dilutions, in the form of nanoparticles of the starting metals and their aggregates. 60 400 60 400 "
"Introduction This study evaluated the effect of Symphytum officinale in homeopathic potency (6cH), on the removal torque and radiographic bone density around titanium implants, inserted in rats tibiae. Symphytum officinale Symphytum officinale Methods Implants were placed in male rat tibiae, and the animals randomized to two groups (Control and S. officinale 6cH treated), which were evaluated at 7, 14, 28 and 56 days post-implantation. Radiographic bone density was measured at 6 points around the implant, using digital radiographic images, when implants were inserted and at sacrifice. Removal torque of the implants was also evaluated. S. officinale S. officinale Results Both removal torque and radiographic bone density evaluation showed that S. officinale 6cH treatment enhanced bone formation around the micro-implants, mainly at 14 days. At 56 days, the radiographic bone density was higher in the treated group. S. officinale S. officinale Conclusions We conclude that S. officinale 6cH enhances, principally at the early stages of osseointegration, bone formation around titanium implants in rats’ tibiae, based on radiographic and mechanical analysis.

"Introduction The objective of this study was to search for effective agents for the treatment of infections in animals or infected cell lines. Methods The Homeopathic Basic Research experiments (HomBRex) database (http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex) on model biological systems in homeopathic research was searched. Eligible experiments were reviewed and analysed. http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex Results The database contains 48 eligible experiments published from 1832 to 2009. Causative pathogens were bacteria, fungi, viruses, proto- and metazoa. In the experiments, various parameters were observed and a large set of medicines was investigated. In eight of the 48 experiments, at least one of the investigated medicines was selected according to the similia principle. Nosodes and homeopathic complexes were investigated in 8 and 14 experiments respectively. Mice were the most often used host organisms (13 experiments). In 31 experiments at least one homeopathic medicine was found effective for treatment. Conclusion The results of basic research experiments may invigorate new clinical trials that investigate complementary treatments for infectious diseases. However, all experiments reviewed here await replication and no clear-cut conclusion can be drawn regarding the transferability of in vitro results to in vivo outcomes. in vitro in vivo in vitro in vivo "
"Hahnemann considered the secondary action of medicines to be a law of nature and reviewed the conditions under which it occurs. It is closely related to the rebound effects observed with many modern drugs. I review the evidence of the rebound effect of statins that support the similitude principle. In view of their indications in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, statins are widely prescribed. Besides reducing cholesterol biosynthesis, they provide vasculoprotective effects (pleiotropic effects), including improvement of endothelial function, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory and thrombogenic responses, stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques, and others. Recent studies suggest that suspension of statin treatment leads to a rebound imparing of vascular function, and increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with vascular diseases. Similarly to other classes of modern palliative drugs, this rebound effect is the same as a secondary action or vital reaction described by Samuel Hahnemann, and used in homeopathy in a therapeutic sense. "
"The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.

"Background Individualised homeopathy involves a large number of possible medicines. For clinical research purposes it is desirable to limit this number, create more consistency between prescribers and optimising the accuracy of prescription. Using a semi-standardised treatment protocol, we aimed to improve homeopathic management of targeted subgroups of women with premenstrual syndrome/symptoms (PMS/S). Objectives To design a semi-standardised protocol for individualised prescribing in PMS/S with a limited number of homeopathic medicines, and to explore the feasibility of working with it in daily homeopathic practice. Methods With help of an expert panel, homeopathic medicines were selected, as well as predictive symptoms and characteristics (keynotes) for each medicine. With those, we designed a patient questionnaire and a diagnostic algorithm. The patient questionnaire contained 123 questions, representing potential predictive symptoms for 11 homeopathic medicines for PMS/S. The medicines selected (in rank order) were Sep, Nat-m, Lach, Cimic, Lac-c, Puls, Calc, Lil-t, Mag-p, Mag-c, Phos. Sep Nat-m Lach Cimic Lac-c Puls Calc Lil-t Mag-p Mag-c Phos In a feasibility study 20 homeopathic doctors used the protocol in daily practice. The diagnosis was confirmed by daily rating of pre-defined symptoms during two consecutive menstrual cycles. The acceptability and feasibility of the protocol were evaluated after 3 months follow-up, at which time we also measured changes in premenstrual symptom scores and patient-reported changes in symptoms and general health. Sep Nat-m Lach Cimic Lac-c Puls Calc Lil-t Mag-p Mag-c Phos Results The doctors mostly complied with the protocol and valued the computerised diagnostic algorithm as a useful tool for homeopathic medicine selection. 33 patients completed 3 months follow-up. By then, 19 patients still taking the first medicine on the basis of the algorithm. We received valid symptom records of 30 patients. Premenstrual symptom scores dropped by 50% or more in 12 patients and by 30–50% in 6 patients; scores dropped by less than 30% or increased in 12 patients. Recruitment of patients (n = 38 in 9 months) proved difficult. Adherence to the diaries and the questionnaire was satisfactory. Conclusions It is feasible to use a semi-standardised protocol for individualised homeopathic prescribing in PMS, in daily practice. Its predictive value and the percentage of women with PMS/S helped by the selected medicines remain to be evaluated in further research. In future research, active promotion will be needed to recruit patients. "
"Introduction Homeopathy is a popular form of complementary and alternative medicine and is used to treat for certain liver ailments. Aim To analyze the efficacy of homeopathic Chelidonium majus (Chel) 30C and 200C in amelioration of experimentally induced hepato-toxicity in rats. Chelidonium majus Chel 30 200 Chelidonium majus Chel 30 200 Methods Rats were randomized into six sub-groups: negative control; negative control + EtOH; positive control; positive control + EtOH group; Chel 30; Chel 200. Rats were sacrificed at day 30, 60, 90 and 120; various toxicity biomarkers and pathological parameters were evaluated. Gelatin zymography for determination of metalloproteinases activity and Western blot of p53 and Bcl-2 proteins were also employed. All analyses were observer blind. Chel 30 Chel 200 Chel 30 Chel 200 Results Chronic feeding of p-dimethyl amino azo benzene (p-DAB) and phenobarbital (PB) elevated the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglyceride, cholesterol, creatinine and bilirubin and lowered the levels of glutathione (GSH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), catalase and HDL-cholesterol. There were statistically significant modulations of these parameters in the treated animals, compared to positive controls. In both treated groups, there was downregulation of metalloproteinases, p53 and Bcl-2 proteins compared to over-expression in the positive control groups. Conclusion Both the potencies of Chel exhibited anti-tumor and anti-oxidative stress potential against artificially induced hepatic tumors and hepato-toxicity in rats. More studies are warranted.

"Background Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) places the sufferer at increased risk of bacterial infection, often requiring emergency hospital admission and long-term antibiotic treatment. Method A single clinical case study of idiopathic SCN in a boy of 3 years and 8 months at the start of treatment individualized, classical homeopathic treatment was given. Neutrophil count was measured at: 5, 17, 21, 29 and 41 months after commencing treatment. Results Low neutrophil count (0.6 and 0.3 × 109/L) was documented for 17 months prior to commencing treatment. After 17 months of individualized homeopathy, neutrophil count was 1.74, rising to 2.22 at 21 and 3.4 at 29 months treatment. Forty-one months after commencing treatment neutrophil count was 3.8 with an intermediate peak of 9 recorded during the year. As the child found the procedure distressing, blood testing was then discontinued by the parents. 9 9 Conclusions The child received no other treatment, including complementary medicine or antibiotics, while receiving homeopathic treatment. Individualized homeopathic intervention may be the catalyst for the resolution of idiopathic SCN in this case. However, as this was a single case, a controlled study is recommended as a next step. "
"Objective The aim of the present report is to provide an overview of the first database on clinical research in veterinary homeopathy. Procedures Detailed searches in the database ‘Veterinary Clinical Research-Database in Homeopathy’ (http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/clinresvet/index.php). http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/clinresvet/index.php http://www.carstens-stiftung.de/clinresvet/index.php Results The database contains about 200 entries of randomised clinical trials, non-randomised clinical trials, observational studies, drug provings, case reports and case series. Twenty-two clinical fields are covered and eight different groups of species are included. The database is free of charge and open to all interested veterinarians and researchers. Conclusion The database enables researchers and veterinarians, sceptics and supporters to get a quick overview of the status of veterinary clinical research in homeopathy and alleviates the preparation of systematical reviews or may stimulate reproductions or even new studies.

"Background Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of major importance in the tropics where the incidence peaks in rainy seasons. Natural disasters represent a big challenge to Leptospirosis prevention strategies especially in endemic regions. Vaccination is an effective option but of reduced effectiveness in emergency situations. Homeoprophylactic interventions might help to control epidemics by using highly-diluted pathogens to induce protection in a short time scale. We report the results of a very large-scale homeoprophylaxis (HP) intervention against Leptospirosis in a dangerous epidemic situation in three provinces of Cuba in 2007. Methods Forecast models were used to estimate possible trends of disease incidence. A homeoprophylactic formulation was prepared from dilutions of four circulating strains of Leptospirosis. This formulation was administered orally to 2.3 million persons at high risk in an epidemic in a region affected by natural disasters. The data from surveillance were used to measure the impact of the intervention by comparing with historical trends and non-intervention regions. Results After the homeoprophylactic intervention a significant decrease of the disease incidence was observed in the intervention regions. No such modifications were observed in non-intervention regions. In the intervention region the incidence of Leptospirosis fell below the historic median. This observation was independent of rainfall. Conclusions The homeoprophylactic approach was associated with a large reduction of disease incidence and control of the epidemic. The results suggest the use of HP as a feasible tool for epidemic control, further research is warranted. "
"Background Due to their popularity as a complementary therapy in many diseases, homeopathic products of animal, vegetable, mineral and chemical origin should be tested for the presence of contaminants to prevent eventual toxic effects. Objective Thirty samples of homeopathic products were analyzed to estimate possible contamination with potentially toxic elements: Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr, Ni and Zn, and to assess human exposure to these metals/metalloid as a consequence of their consumption. Methods Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine metal and metalloid concentrations. Results Most tested products had very low metal/metalloid levels (below the limit of quantification of the method), but the metal/metalloid levels in the remaining products were in the following ranges (in μg g−1): Pb 0.33–1.29 (6 samples), Cd 2.78 (1 sample), As 0.22 (1 sample), Hg 0.02–0.12 (24 samples), Cr 0.40–10.27 (10 samples), Ni 0.43–55.00 (19 samples), and Zn 2.20–27.80 (11 samples). In the absence of regulatory standards for homeopathic products, the obtained results were compared to maximum allowable levels (MALs) as proposed by USP Ad Hoc Advisory Panel. Some analyzed preparations had metal levels above MALs (Pb: 2 samples; Cd: 1 sample; Ni: 2 samples). However, estimated cumulative daily intakes from tested homeopathic products were in all cases lower than permitted daily exposures for all dosage forms. −1 −1 Conclusion The risk of bioaccumulation of metals/metalloid from the homeopathic medicines seems to be rather low, due to small quantities of those products prescribed to be applied per day, as well as insignificant metal contamination of the majority of tested products. However, the fact that particular formulations were contaminated by metals above MALs indicates potential risk and points to the necessity of regular monitoring of homeopathic products for metal contamination, due to their frequent and mostly unsupervised use.

"Introduction Previous studies have shown the stimulating effect of Helicobacter pylori on the gene expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) using the gastric epithelial cell line KATO-III. Strychnos Nux vomica (Nux vomica) and Calendula officinalis are used in highly diluted form in homeopathic medicine to treat patients suffering from gastritis and gastric ulcers. Helicobacter pylori Nux vomica) Calendula officinalis Helicobacter pylori Nux vomica) Calendula officinalis Aim and method To investigate the influence of Nux vomica and Calendula officinalis on HB-EGF-like growth factor gene expression in KATO-III cells under the stimulation of H. pylori strain N6 using real-time PCR with and without addition of Nux vomica and Calendula officinalis as a 10c or 12c potency. Nux vomica Calendula officinalis H. pylori Nux vomica Calendula officinalis Nux vomica Calendula officinalis H. pylori Nux vomica Calendula officinalis Results Baseline expression and stimulation were similar to previous experiments, addition of Nux vomica 10c and Calendula officinalis 10c in a 43% ethanolic solution led to a significant reduction of H. pylori induced increase in gene expression of HB-EGF (reduced to 53.12 ± 0.95% and 75.32 ± 1.16% vs. control; p < 0.05), respectively. Nux vomica 12c reduced HB-EGF gene expression even in dilutions beyond Avogadro’s number (55.77 ± 1.09%; p < 0.05). Nux vomica 12c in a 21.5% ethanol showed a smaller effect (71.80 ± 3.91%, p < 0.05). This effect was only be observed when the drugs were primarily prepared in ethanol, not in aqueous solutions. The data suggest that both drugs prepared in ethanolic solution are potent inhibitors of H. pylori induced gene expression.

"Background This paper reports dielectric dispersion occurring in potentised homeopathic medicines subjected to variable frequency electric field using an instrumentation method developed by the authors. Oscillations occur in the direction of electric field, and are usually termed longitudinal/acoustic-mode vibrations. Methods The test material was lactose soaked with homeopathic medicine. Multiple resonance frequencies, forming a frequency-set, were observed repeatedly for each medicine. Results We report experimental results for three potencies of Cuprum metallicum (Cuprum met) in the frequency range of 100 kHz–1 MHz. Each exhibits a set of resonance frequencies, which may be termed as its characteristic set. As the frequency-set of each medicine is different from those of others, each medicine may, therefore, be identified by its characteristic frequency-set. This suggests that potentised homeopathic medicines, which are chemically identical with the vehicle, differ from one another in the arrangement of vehicle molecules.

"Introduction Routine use of antibiotics to prevent mastitis in dairy cows is prohibited by organic farming regulations. Internal Teat Sealers have been proposed as an alternative. We compared two drying-off (DO) supporting measures (Internal Teat Sealer and Homeopathy) to an untreated control group to assess their protective effects against clinical mastitis and intra-mammary infections during dry period of dairy cows. Methods A field trial with 102 dairy cows from 13 Swiss organic dairy farms was conducted. Cows were randomly assigned to one of three groups within a herd. In the Internal Teat Sealer group (ITS; 36 cows) cows were treated with the commercial ORBESEAL (Pfizer) in all four quarters immediately after the last milking. In the Homeopathy group (HDT; 32 cows) the cows were treated per-orally by a herd-specific homeopathic formulation consisting of two remedies in 1:106 dilution over 5 days before and after DO. The untreated group received no therapy (U; 34 cows). 6 6 Results For ITS, HDT and U the clinical mastitis incidence rates for the first 100 days post-calving were 11%, 9% and 3%, respectively, and the proportion of normally secreting quarters was (quarter somatic cell count (SCC) [QSCC] < 100,000/ml) 70%, 68%, and 65%, respectively. Power analysis indicates that a proportion of 75% would support the rejection of null hypothesis in the HDT, and 74% in the ITS group against untreated control. Quarters of cows with SCC < 200,000/ml at DO showed significantly higher normal secretion in HDT group (odds ratio [OR] 9.69) compared to untreated control, whereas Teat Sealing lead to an OR of 3.09 (not significant, post hoc power 31.3%). post hoc post hoc Conclusions Under the studied conditions herd-specific homeopathic dry cow therapy was effective in increasing the number of animals with normal milk secretion after subsequent parturition, compared to untreated control. It may be an effective alternative to Teat Sealing, particularly in animals with relatively low SCCs. Further research is required to confirm these results, and under different environmental conditions. "
"Background Like other forms of medicine, including Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), homeopathy elicits expectations in patients. The physician–patient relationship, personal and comprehensive treatment and lack of adverse effects are elements in creating positive expectations. Other elements may be associated with negative expectations. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review on placebo and nocebo effects in acupuncture and homeopathy using Medline. Results Findings on the psychophysiological and neuromediating mechanisms of the placebo–nocebo phenomenon are reviewed. Studies of these effects reveal how expectations and unconscious conditioning can be measured by imaging and EEG methods. They result in significant, non-specific therapeutic effects, which may confuse the evaluation of the specific therapeutic effects treatment, hampering selection of the simillimum. simillimum simillimum Conclusions Directions for future research on non-specific therapeutic effects of homeopathy to improve clinical practice and clinical research are discussed.

"Homeopathy was introduced in India the early 19th century. It flourished in Bengal at first, and then spread all over India. In the beginning, the system was extensively practised by amateurs in the civil and military services and others. Mahendra Lal Sircar was the first Indian who became a homeopathic physician. A number of allopathic doctors started homeopathic practice following Sircar's lead. The ‘Calcutta Homeopathic Medical College’, the first homeopathic medical college was established in 1881. This institution took on a major role in popularising homeopathy in India. In 1973, the Government of India recognised homeopathy as one of the national systems of medicine and set up the Central Council of Homeopathy (CCH) to regulate its education and practice. Now, only qualified registered homeopaths can practice homeopathy in India. At present, in India, homeopathy is the third most popular method of medical treatment after allopathy and Ayurveda. There are over 200,000 registered homeopathic doctors currently, with approximately 12,000 more being added every year. "
"On the basis of the first- and second-order Gompertzian kinetics it has been proved that the crystallization and its reciprocal process of dissolution belong to the class of quasi-quantum non-local coherent phenomena. Hence, there exists a direct link to homeopathy: molecules of the remedy prepared in the process of dilution of the active substance are non-locally interconnected at-a-distance. The results obtained provide strong arguments justifying formulated ad hoc macroscopic versions of quantum non-locality, entanglement and coherence employed in interpretation of the homeopathic remedies activity and effectiveness. In particular they are consistent with the predictions of the weak quantum theory developed by Atmanspacher and coworkers. ad hoc ad hoc "
"Introduction Hitherto entries have been added to a rubric in the repertory when patients responding well to a specific medicine showed the corresponding symptom. Continuing like this, theoretically every medicine will eventually appear in every rubric. Method This becomes clear if we compare opposite symptom-rubrics. Polarity Analysis (PA) subtracts opposite rubrics and has been shown to improve clinical results. Conclusion The source of this problem and the reason for the success of PA are clear from Bayesian perspective. A reliable repertory should be based on Bayesian principles. "
"Background The use of antibiotics in the livestock sector is increasing to such an extent that it threatens negative consequences for human health, animal health and the environment. Homeopathy might be an alternative to antibiotics. It has therefore been tested in a randomised placebo-controlled trial to prevent Escherichia coli diarrhoea in neonatal piglets. Escherichia coli Escherichia coli Method On a commercial pig farm 52 sows of different parities, in their last month of gestation, were treated twice a week with either the homeopathic agent Coli 30K or placebo. The 525 piglets born from these sows were scored for occurrence and duration of diarrhoea. Coli Coli Results Piglets of the homeopathic treated group had significantly less E. coli diarrhoea than piglets in the placebo group (P < .0001). Especially piglets from first parity sows gave a good response to treatment with Coli 30K. The diarrhoea seemed to be less severe in the homeopathically treated litters, there was less transmission and duration appeared shorter. E. coli P Coli E. coli P Coli "
"This paper examines the activation and inhibition of activation of human basophils. After a brief description of human basophils, different methods to determine basophil activation are discussed with a special emphasis on the use of flow cytometric methods, as these circumvent the potential problems of assays based on the loss of colour by activated basophils. The activation of human basophils by ultra-high dilutions of anti-IgE is discussed. The majority of the paper describes the inhibition of basophil activation by ultra-high dilutions of histamine. The results from published papers are described and discussed. After over 20 years research trying to find out if high dilutions of histamine have a negative feedback effect on the activation of basophils by anti-IgE, what do we know? The methods are poorly standardized between laboratories – although the same is true for conventional studies. Certainly there appears to be some evidence for an effect – albeit small in some cases – with the high dilutions in several different laboratories using the flow cytometric methodologies. After standardization of a number of parameters, it is recommended that a multi-centre trial be performed to hopefully put an end to this “never-ending story”. "
"Introduction This is a systematic review of the animal models used in studies of high dilutions. The objectives are to analyze methodological quality of papers and reported results, and to highlight key conceptual aspects of high dilution to suggest clues concerning putative mechanisms of action. Methods Papers for inclusion were identified systematically, from the Pubmed-Medline database, using ‘Homeopathy’ and ‘Animal’ as keywords. Only original full papers in English published between January 1999 and June 2009 were included, reviews, scientific reports, thesis, older papers, papers extracted from Medline using similar keywords, papers about mixed commercial formulas and books were also considered for discussion only. 31 papers describing 33 experiments were identified for the main analysis and a total of 89 items cited. Results Systematic analysis of the selected papers yielded evidence of some important intrinsic features of high dilution studies performed in animal models: a) methodological quality was generally adequate, some aspects could be improved; b) convergence between results and materia medica is seen in some studies, pointing toward to the possibility of systematic study of the Similia principle c) both isopathic and Similia models seem useful to understand some complex biological phenomena, such as parasite–host interactions; d) the effects of high dilutions seem to stimulate restoration of a ‘stable state’, as seen in several experimental models from both descriptive and mathematical points of view. materia medica Similia Similia materia medica Similia Similia "
"Objectives To analyze the solutes leaching from glass containers into aqueous solutions, and to show that these solutes have enzyme activity stabilizing effects in very dilute solutions. Methods Enzyme assays with acetylcholine esterase were used to analyze serially succussed and diluted (SSD) solutions prepared in glass and plastic containers. Aqueous SSD preparations starting with various solutes, or water alone, were prepared under several conditions, and tested for their solute content and their ability to affect enzyme stability in dilute solution. Results We confirm that water acts to dissolve constituents from glass vials, and show that the solutes derived from the glass have effects on enzymes in the resultant solutions. Enzyme assays demonstrated that enzyme stability in purified and deionized water was enhanced in SSD solutions that were prepared in glass containers, but not those prepared in plastic. The increased enzyme stability could be mimicked in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of silicates to the purified, deionized water that enzymes were dissolved in. Elemental analyses of SSD water preparations made in glass vials showed that boron, silicon, and sodium were present at micromolar concentrations. Conclusions These results show that silicates and other solutes are present at micromolar levels in all glass-exposed solutions, whether pharmaceutical or homeopathic in nature. Even though silicates are known to have biological activity at higher concentrations, the silicate concentrations we measured in homeopathic preparations were too low to account for any purported in vivo efficacy, but could potentially influence in vitro biological assays reporting homeopathic effects. in vivo in vitro in vivo in vitro "
"Background It has been hypothesised that randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of classical (individualised) homeopathy often fail because placebo effects are substantially higher than in conventional medicine. Objectives To compare placebo effects in clinical trials on homeopathy to placebo effects on trials of conventional medicines. Methods We performed a systematic literature analysis on placebo-controlled double-blind RCTs on classical homeopathy. Each trial was matched to three placebo-controlled double-blind RCTs from conventional medicine (mainly pharmacological interventions) involving the same diagnosis. Matching criteria included severity of complaints, choice of outcome parameter, and treatment duration. Outcome was measured as the percentage change of symptom scores from baseline to end of treatment in the placebo group. 35 RCTs on classical homeopathy were identified. 10 were excluded because no relevant data could be extracted, or less than three matching conventional trials could be located. Results In 13 matched sets the placebo effect in the homeopathic trials was larger than the average placebo effect of the conventional trials, in 12 matched sets it was lower (P = 0.39). Additionally, no subgroup analysis yielded any significant difference. P P Conclusions Placebo effects in RCTs on classical homeopathy did not appear to be larger than placebo effects in conventional medicine. "
"This paper describes the results of a research program focused on the beneficial effect of low dose stress conditions that were applied according to the similia principle to cells previously disturbed by more severe stress conditions. In first instance, we discuss criteria for research on the similia principle at the cellular level. Then, the homologous (‘isopathic’) approach is reviewed, in which the initial (high dose) stress used to disturb cellular physiology and the subsequent (low dose) stress are identical. homologous Beneficial effects of low dose stress are described in terms of increased cellular survival capacity and at the molecular level as an increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins (hsps). Both phenomena reflect a stimulation of the endogenous cellular self-recovery capacity. Low dose stress conditions applied in a homologous approach stimulate the synthesis of hsps and enhance survival in comparison with stressed cells that were incubated in the absence of low dose stress conditions. Thirdly, the specificity of the low dose stress condition is described where the initial (high dose) stress is different in nature from the subsequently applied (low dose) stress; the heterologous or ‘heteropathic’ approach. heterologous The results support the similia principle at the cellular level and add to understanding of how low dose stress conditions influence the regulatory processes underlying self-recovery. In addition, the phenomenon of ‘symptom aggravation’ which is also observed at the cellular level, is discussed in the context of self-recovery. Finally, the difference in efficiency between the homologous and the heterologous approach is discussed; a perspective is indicated for further research; and the relationship between studies on the similia principle and the recently introduced concept of ‘postconditioning hormesis’ is emphasized. homologous heterologous "
"Introduction Chronic primary insomnia is defined as difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or of non-restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month and causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The homeopathic simillimum is that remedy which most closely corresponds to the totality of symptoms; remedy selection is based on a full evaluation of the patient's physical, emotional and mental characteristics. Aim/Purpose The purpose of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of homeopathic simillimum in the treatment of chronic primary insomnia. Method 30 participants were selected in accordance with DSM-IV TR (2000)1 criterion 307.42 Primary Insomnia and then randomly divided between treatment and placebo groups. The measurement tools used were a Sleep Diary (SD) and the Sleep Impairment Index (SII).2 1 2 After an initial consultation, 2 follow-up consultations at 2-week intervals took place. Homeopathic medication was prescribed at the first and second consultations. The SII was completed at each consultation and participants were instructed at the first consultation to start the SD. - - 1 2 - - Results SD data revealed that verum treatment resulted in a significant increase in duration of sleep throughout the study, compared to the placebo treatment which resulted in no significant increase in duration of sleep. A significant improvement in SII summary scores and number of improved individual questions were found in the verum group, responses to all 11 questions having improved significantly upon completion of the study. An initial improvement occurred in the placebo group, but was not sustained. Comparison of results between the groups revealed a statistically significant difference. Conclusion The homeopathic simillimum treatment of primary insomnia was effective, compared to placebo. Homeopathy is a viable treatment modality for this condition and further research is justified.

"This review presents a critical evaluation of methodological quality in controlled trials on homeopathic treatment of influenza. First, a short summary on the prevalence, quality, and most commonly cited shortcomings of homeopathic controlled trials in general is presented to support the more specific points within influenza trials alone. To this end, three areas of the homeopathic literature are examined; large meta-analyses looking at study quality and results across research areas, reviews on research within specific diagnostic categories, and the available reviews and primary studies on influenza treatment trials. The specific methodological designs of homeopathic influenza treatment trials are then compared, on a point by point basis, to pharmaceutical trials on influenza antiviral drugs. The goal of the evaluation is to highlight frequently cited problems in homeopathic trial design, suggest possible improvement for future studies, and make specific recommendations for homeopathic influenza trials based on a comparison to standard antiviral trials. "
"Introduction Repeatability of experiments is an important criterion of modern research and a major challenge for homeopathic basic research. There is no recent overview about basic research studies in high homeopathic potencies that have been subjected to laboratory-internal, multicenter or independent repetition trials. Methods We considered biochemical, immunological, botanical, cell biological and zoological studies on high potencies, i.e. beyond a dilution of 10-23. Main sources of information were reviews, personal contact with members of the homeopathic basic research community, and the MEDLINE and HOMBREX databases. Studies were extracted from the publications and grouped into models. Studies were further sorted according to repetition type (laboratory-internal, multicenter, or independent) and results achieved. -23 -23 Results A total of 107 studies were found. Of these, 30 were initial studies. In the attempt to reproduce one of these initial studies, 53 follow-up studies yielded comparable effects (35 laboratory-internal, 8 multicenter, 10 independent repetitions), eight studies showed a consistent, yet different result from the initial study (2 laboratory-internal, 2 multicenter, 4 independent repetitions), and 16 studies yielded no effects (5 laboratory-internal, 2 multicenter, 9 independent repetitions). When all repetitive studies are considered, 69% reported effects comparable to that of the initial study, 10% different effects, and 21% no effects. Independently performed repetition studies reported 44% comparable effects, 17% different effects, and 39% no effects. Conclusions We identified 24 experimental models in basic research on high homeopathic potencies, which were repeatedly investigated. 22 models were reproduced with comparable results, 6 models with different results, and repetition showed no results for 15 models. Independent reproductions with either comparable or different results were found for seven models. We encourage further repetition trials of published studies, in order to learn more about the model systems used and in order to test their repeatability. "
"Background The last comprehensive review of experimental research on effects of homeopathic treatments on plants was published in 1984, and lacked formal predefined criteria to assess study quality. Since then several new studies with more advanced methods have been published. Objectives To compile a review of the literature on basic research in homeopathy with healthy plants with particular reference to studies investigating specific effects of homeopathic remedies. Methods The literature search included English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish publications from 1920 to April 2009, using predefined selection criteria. We included experiments with healthy whole plants, seeds, plant parts and cells. The outcomes had to be measured by established procedures and statistically evaluated. We developed a Manuscript Information Score (MIS) and included only publications which provided enough information for proper interpretation (MIS ≥ 5). A formalised Study Methods Evaluation Procedure (SMEP) was used to evaluate these studies, and the subgroup of studies with adequate controls to identify specific effects. Results A total of 86 studies in 79 publications was identified, 43 studies included statistics, 29 had MIS ≥ 5, and 15 studies investigated the specificity of homeopathic preparations. Specific effects of decimal, centesimal and fifty millesimal potencies were found including dilution levels far beyond the Avogadro number. In consecutive series of potencies only some of the tested potencies showed effects. There were many individual studies with diverse methods and very few reproduction trials. Conclusions Healthy plant models seem an useful approach to investigate basic research questions about the specificity of homeopathic preparations. More investigations with more advanced methods are recommended, especially in the sectors of potentisation techniques, effective potency levels and conditions for reproducibility. Systematic negative control experiments should become a routine procedure to control the stability of the experimental systems. "
"Background Reporting experiments in basic research in homeopathy is an important issue as comprehensive description of what exactly was done is required. So far, there is no guideline for authors available, unlike criteria catalogues common in clinical research. Methods A Delphi Process was conducted, including a total of five rounds, three rounds of adjusting and phrasing plus two consensus conferences. European researchers who published experimental work within the last five years were involved. Results A checklist of 23 items was obtained and supplemented with detailed examples emphasizing what each item implies. Background, objectives and possible hypotheses should be given in the part ‘introduction’. Special emphasis is put on the ‘materials and methods’ section, where a detailed description of chosen controls, object of investigation, experimental setup, replication, parameters, intervention, allocation, blinding, and statistical methods is required. The section ‘results’ should present sufficient details on analysed data, descriptive as well as inferential. Authors should discuss their results and give an interpretation in the context of current evidence. Conclusion A guideline for Reporting Experiments in Homeopathic Basic Research (REHBaR) was compiled to be applied by authors when preparing their manuscripts, and to be used by scientific journals in the reviewing process. Furthermore the guideline is a commitment to a certain minimum quality level needed in basic research, e.g. blinding and randomisation. Feedback is encouraged on applicability, strength and limitations of the list to enable future revisions. "
"Background The literature on the applications of homeopathy for controlling plant diseases in both plant pathological models and field trials was first reviewed by Scofield in 1984. No other review on homeopathy in plant pathology has been published since, though much new research has subsequently been carried out using more advanced methods. Objectives To conduct an up-to-date review of the existing literature on basic research in homeopathy using phytopathological models and experiments in the field. Methods A literature search was carried out on publications from 1969 to 2009, for papers that reported experiments on homeopathy using phytopathological models (in vitro and in planta) and field trials. The selected papers were summarized and analysed on the basis of a Manuscript Information Score (MIS) to identify those that provided sufficient information for proper interpretation (MIS ≥ 5). These were then evaluated using a Study Methods Evaluation Procedure (SMEP). in vitro in planta in vitro in planta Results A total of 44 publications on phytopathological models were identified: 19 papers with statistics, 6 studies with MIS ≥ 5. Publications on field were 9, 6 with MIS ≥ 5. In general, significant and reproducible effects with decimal and centesimal potencies were found, including dilution levels beyond the Avogadro's number. Conclusions The prospects for homeopathic treatments in agriculture are promising, but much more experimentation is needed, especially at a field level, and on potentisation techniques, effective potency levels and conditions for reproducibility. Phytopathological models may also develop into useful tools to answer pharmaceutical questions. "
"The first part of this paper reviews the effects of homeopathic remedies on several models of anxiety-like behaviours developed and described in rodents. The existing literature in this field comprises some fifteen exploratory studies, often published in non-indexed and non-peer-reviewed journals. Only a few results have been confirmed by multiple laboratories, and concern Ignatia, Gelsemium, Chamomilla (in homeopathic dilutions/potencies). Nevertheless, there are some interesting results pointing to the possible efficacy of other remedies, and confirming a statistically significant effect of high dilutions of neurotrophic molecules and antibodies. In the second part of this paper we report some recent results obtained in our laboratory, testing Aconitum, Nux vomica, Belladonna, Argentum nitricum, Tabacum (all 5CH potency) and Gelsemium (5, 7, 9 and 30CH potencies) on mice using ethological models of behaviour. The test was performed using coded drugs and controls in double blind (operations and calculations). After an initial screening that showed all the tested remedies (except for Belladonna) to have some effects on the behavioural parameters (light–dark test and open-field test), but with high experimental variability, we focused our study on Gelsemium, and carried out two complete series of experiments. The results showed that Gelsemium had several effects on the exploratory behaviour of mice, which in some models were highly statistically significant (p < 0.001), in all the dilutions/dynamizations used, but with complex differences according to the experimental conditions and test performed. Finally, some methodological issues of animal research in this field of homeopathy are discussed. The “Gelsemium model” – encompassing experimental studies in vitro and in vivo from different laboratories and with different methods, including significant effects of its major active principle gelsemine – may play a pivotal rule for investigations on other homeopathic remedies.

"Background At the beginning of this series of experiments we were looking for a model based on the use of purified commercially available compounds based on a fully described and accepted pharmacological model to study of the biological effect of high dilutions. Negative feedback induced by histamine, a major pro-inflammatory mediator, on basophils and mast cells activation via an H2 receptor me these criteria. The simplest way of measuring basophil activation in the early 1980's was the human basophil activation test (HBDT). via via Objectives Our major goal was first to study the biological effect of centesimal histamine dilutions beyond the Avogadro limit, on the staining properties of human basophils activated by an allergen extract initially house dust mite, then an anti-IgE and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Technical development over the 25 years of our work led us to replace the manual basophil counting by flow cytometry. The main advantages were automation and observer independence. Using this latter protocol our aim was to confirm the existence of this phenomenon and to check its specificity by testing, under the same conditions, inactive analogues of histamine and histamine antagonists. More recently, we developed an animal model (mouse basophils) to study the effect of histamine on histamine release. Methods and results For the HBDT model basophils were obtained by sedimentation of human blood taken on EDTA and stained with Alcian blue. Results were expressed in percentage activation. Histamine dilutions tested were freshly prepared in the lab by successive centesimal dilutions and vortexing. Water controls were prepared in the same way. For the flow cytometric protocol basophils were first labeled by an anti-IgE FITC (basophil marker) and an anti-CD63 (basophil activation marker). Results were expressed in percentage of CD63 positive basophils. Another flow cytometric protocol has been developed more recently, based on basophil labeling by anti-IgE FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and anti-CD203 PE (another human basophil activation marker). Results were expressed in mean fluorescence intensity of the CD203c positive population (MFI-CD203c) and an activation index calculated by an algorithm. For the mouse basophil model, histamine was measured spectrofluorimetrically. The main results obtained over 28 years of work was the demonstration of a reproducible inhibition of human basophil activation by high dilutions of histamine, the effect peaks in the range of 15–17CH. The effect was not significant when histamine was replaced by histidine (a histamine precursor) or cimetidine (histamine H2 receptor antagonist) was added to the incubation medium. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry. Using the latter technique, we also showed that 4-Methyl histamine (H2 agonist) induced a similar effect, in contrast to 1-Methyl histamine, an inactive histamine metabolite. Using the mouse model, we showed that histamine high dilutions, in the same range of dilutions, inhibited histamine release. Conclusions Successively, using different models to study of human and murine basophil activation, we demonstrated that high dilutions of histamine, in the range of 15–17CH induce a reproducible biological effect. This phenomenon has been confirmed by a multi-center study using the HBDT model and by at least three independent laboratories by flow cytometry. The specificity of the observed effect was confirmed, versus the water controls at the same dilution level by the absence of biological activity of inactive compounds such as histidine and 1-Methyl histamine and by the reversibility of this effect in the presence of a histamine receptor H2 antagonist. versus versus "
"Background Two experimental studies on wheat preintoxicated with Arsenic trioxide yielded a significant shoot growth increase after an isopathic application of Ars-alb 45x. One independent reproduction trial however, yielded an effect inversion: wheat shoot growth was significantly decreased after application of Ars-alb 45x. Ars-alb Ars-alb Ars-alb Ars-alb Aims In this study we investigated the role of three potential confounding factors on the experimental outcome: geographical location of the experiments, influence of the main experimenter, and seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning. Laboratory-internal reproducibility was assessed by meta-analysis. Material and methods Wheat poisoned with Arsenic trioxide was cultivated in vitro in either Ars-alb 45x, water 45x, or unpotentised water. Treatments were blinded and randomised. Shoot length was measured after 7 days. The stability of the experimental set-up was assessed by systematic negative control (SNC) experiments. in vitro Ars-alb in vitro Ars-alb Results The SNC experiments did not yield significant differences between the three groups treated with unpotentised water. Thus the experimental set-up seemed to be stable. We did not observe any shoot growth increase after a treatment with Ars-alb 45x in any of the newly performed experiments. In contrast, the meta-analysis of all 17 experiments performed (including earlier experiments already published) yielded a statistically significant shoot growth decrease (−3.2%, p = 0.017) with isopathic Ars-alb 45x treatment. This effect was quantitatively similar across all five series of experiments. Ars-alb p Ars-alb Ars-alb p Ars-alb Conclusions Ultramolecular Ars-alb 45x led to statistically significant specific effects in arsenic poisoned wheat when investigated by two independent working groups. Effect size and effect direction differ, however. The investigated factors (geographical location, experimenter, seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning) did not seem to be responsible for the effect inversion. Laboratory external reproducibility of basic research into homeopathic potentisation remains a difficult issue. Ars-alb Ars-alb "
"Mice (Mus musculus) have been used as a model for homeopathy research in relation to cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenesis in our laboratory for the last three decades. Initially, anti-radiation activities of several potentized homeopathic drugs were tested against suitable controls by taking into consideration several cytogenetic endpoints. Subsequently, anti-cytotoxic, anti-genotoxic and anti-oxidative stress effects of some homeopathic drugs were tested against several chemical toxic metalloids and metal compounds. Modern techniques including Western blot, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, UV-spectroscopy, HPLC, FTIR, NMR, RT-PCR etc were deployed to understand the possible mechanisms and pathways of action of potentized homeopathic drugs. We hypothesise that one way by which potentized homeopathic drugs act is through regulatory action on gene expression. Mus musculus Mus musculus "
"The Similia Principle, the basis of homeopathy, implies that substances initiating symptoms when applied to healthy biological systems can be utilized as remedies to treat a diseased system with similar symptoms. Depending whether the remedy substance was of the same type as the etiologic agent, treatment is classified as either homologous or heterologous. The intact rat is the biological system most utilized in basic science homeopathic research. The Homeopathy Basic Research experiments (HomBRex) database (about 1300 experiments on model biological systems in homeopathic research) was analyzed for homologous and heterologous treatments of disease states of intact rats. The relationship between the Similia Principle and hormesis is discussed. "
"This paper describes the successful outcome of homeopathic treatment in a case of resistant livedoid vasculopathy (LV). LV is a rare disease characterized by chronic recurrent and painful ulceration of the lower limbs, frequently associated to atrophie blanche (AB), probably due to procoagulant conditions. Most literature reports single or very few cases; response to treatment is difficult, even resistant. This patient suffered LV for 7 years before seeking homeopathic treatment; ulcers recurred frequently, at intervals less than 3 months, in spite of continual use of pentoxyfilline. Configuration of signs and symptoms strongly pointed out to the prescription of homeopathic remedy Sepia succus that promptly elicited significant improvement of LV and the patient's overall state (non suppressive treatment). Considerations are made on the value of single case reports and the reliability of prescriptions grounded on consistent signs and coherence among the manifold features of individual disease. atrophie blanche Sepia succus atrophie blanche Sepia succus "
"This study sought to assess the effectiveness of individualized homeopathic treatment on dermatological complaints in a public outpatient clinic. Methods Children and adults spontaneously seeking for homeopathic treatment for dermatological complaints were prescribed single individualized remedies and followed up for a minimum of 3 months; assessment was clinical and recorded graphically. Results Forty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were positive (59%); no effect (4%); drop-out (37%), from which 6% was due to homeopathic aggravation. No manifestations of suppression were observed. Conclusions Outcome studies are useful to point out to the effectiveness of individualized homeopathic treatment in dermatological complaints. Outcomes suggest that actions focusing on pathological categories do not lead to homeopathic suppression. "
"Objective To evaluate the response to homeopathic treatment in a public homeopathic clinic of all patients attending between September 1998 until December 2005, and to analyze homeopathic practice. Methods and setting Longitudinal observational study in a homeopathic clinic based in a public hospital in Lucca, Italy. Data relating to patient details, clinical diagnosis, remedy prescribed, potency of dosage, prescription strategy and identification of the case as acute-chronic-recurrent were analyzed. Clinical response was assessed by the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Score. Results Overall 74% of patients reported at least moderate improvement. Outcomes were better with longer treatment duration and younger age of patients. Respiratory, followed by dermatological and gastrointestinal pathologies responded best, psychological problems relatively poorly. Conclusions Homeopathic therapy is associated with improvement in a range of chronic and recurring pathologies. Certain characteristics of patient and pathology influence the outcome. "

"Background Toxicodendron pubescens is a botanical name of Rhus toxicodendron (Rhus tox). This plant is widely used in its homeopathically diluted form in the treatment of inflammatory and edematous conditions. In this study, various dilutions of Rhus tox including its crude form have been evaluated for their effects on immune response in the in vivo and in vitro experimental models. Toxicodendron pubescens Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox in vivo in vitro Toxicodendron pubescens Rhus toxicodendron Rhus tox Rhus tox in vivo in vitro Methods Rhus tox in the form of mother tincture, 6cH, 30cH, 200cH and 1000cH dilutions was tested through in vivo models including sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) induced cellular and humoral immune response in C57/BL6 mice. Rhus tox in vivo The effects of Rhus tox dilutions were also evaluated in vitro on the functions of human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells such as phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Candida albicans, chemotaxis, and reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye. Rhus tox in vitro Candida albicans Rhus tox in vivo Rhus tox in vitro Candida albicans Results Rhus tox was found to intensify SRBCs induced antibody titer and delayed type hypersensitivity response in mice. Even higher dilutions such as 200cH and 1000cH were found to affect the immune response; however, the crude form, mother tincture, 6cH and 30cH dilutions revealed more potent effects than the 200cH and 1000cH dilutions. Rhus tox In in vitro assays, all the dilutions exerted stimulation of phagocytosis, candidacidal activity and chemotaxis of human PMN cells. The NBT dye reduction assay revealed that oxidative processes in the PMN cells are accelerated in the presence of Rhus tox. in vitro Rhus tox This study shows that Rhus tox possesses immunostimulatory activity in its crude form as well as in homeopathically diluted forms. These effects appeared to be concentration dependent as higher dilutions had less potent effects. Rhus tox Rhus tox in vitro Rhus tox Rhus tox "
"Immunomodulators are substances which modify the immunity of an individual to favour a particular immunological response. The immune response and the function of the immune response regulation process are described, with special reference to cancer and autoimmune disease.

"Objective A preliminary study to evaluate the usefulness of homeopathic treatment in the care of menstrual irregularities. Method Patients were diagnosed at the first appointment according to menstrual cycle over the past year: Amenorrhea (AM), Oligo-amenorrhea (OL-AM), OL, Taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). All patients were prescribed an individualised, global homeopathic treatment. The main outcomes were: time to resumption of periods, change of clinical diagnosis at the end of follow-up or after 2 years. The secondary outcomes were: menstrual regularity at the end of follow-up, compared to pre-treatment frequency; flow characteristics; clinical course of acute and chronic concomitant symptoms. Results 18 consecutive cases of secondary amenorrhea (SA) and oligomenorrhea (OL) met the entry criteria. 8 women had SA, 2 were on HRT, 6 had OL-AM and 2 had OL. The average duration of considered follow-up was 21 months. The average time before the reappearance of menstruation was 58 days (s.d. 20) in the 8 women with SA at the time of the first appointment, for all cases 46 days (s.d. 42). Change of clinical diagnosis: 50% of women, who were diagnosed AM, recovered their ovulatory cycle (OV), whereas 12.5% remained amenorrheic; 33.3% of patients, who were initially OL-AM, showed an OV; 100% of oligomenorrheic and HRT patients recovered an OV. The average frequency of spontaneous cycles per year changes from 4.32 (s.d. 1.97) pre-treatment to 9.6 cycles per year at the end (s.d. 2.92). Four detailed case histories are reported. "
"Background Samuel Hahnemann noticed that palliative treatments for the symptoms of chronic diseases, after an initial improvement, provoked symptoms similar but stronger symptoms to those initially suppressed. He regarded this as a consequence of the vital reaction of the organism: an automatic and instinctive capacity to return to the initial health condition altered by medicines. Using this homeostatic conception of the organism as a treatment rationale, Hahnemann proposed the therapy of similarity, administering to the patients medicines capable of causing, in healthy individuals, similar symptoms to the natural disease. Based on experimental observations, he proposed that the primary action of the drug was followed by the secondary and opposite action of the organism, inaugurating homeopathic pharmacology, and alerting to the harmful consequences of palliative medicines in susceptible individuals. Such iatrogenic events can be observed in contemporary medicine, after the withdrawal of modern enantiopathic medicines, according to the study of the rebound effect or paradoxical reaction of the organism. Method:This study reviews the recent studies which describe suicidality after the suspension or discontinuation of second generation antidepressants according to the hypothesis of the paradoxical reaction of the organism. Conclusions: Rebound and withdrawal effects, including suicidality occur with antidepressant drugs. They are relatively rare but more intense than the primary action of the drug. The probability of such effects is influenced by patient factors including age and diagnosis, and drug factors including half-life. Method: Conclusions Method: Conclusions "

"Objectives To assess the feasibility of a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) design of usual care compared with usual care plus adjunctive care by a homeopath for patients with Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods In a pragmatic parallel group RCT design, adults with a diagnosis of FMS (ACR criteria) were randomly allocated to usual care or usual care plus adjunctive care by a homeopath. Adjunctive care consisted of five in depth interviews and individualised homeopathic medicines. The primary outcome measure was the difference in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score at 22 weeks. Results 47 patients were recruited. Drop out rate in the usual care group was higher than the homeopath care group (8/24 vs 3/23). Adjusted for baseline, there was a significantly greater mean reduction in the FIQ total score (function) in the homeopath care group than the usual care group (−7.62 vs 3.63). There were significantly greater reductions in the homeopath care group in the McGill pain score, FIQ fatigue and tiredness upon waking scores. We found a small effect on pain score (0.21, 95% CI −1.42 to 1.84); but a large effect on function (0.81, 95% CI −8.17 to 9.79). There were no reported adverse events. vs vs vs vs Conclusions Given the acceptability of the treatment and the clinically relevant effect on function, there is a need for a definitive study to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of adjunctive healthcare by a homeopath for patients with FMS.

"Background Previous studies have investigated toxicity inhibition of optically active compounds by potentized preparations of their enantiomers. It was hypothesised that inhibition of toxicity may be stereospecific. This paper presents 2 studies investigating stereoisomer potencies in terms of their ability to counteract toxicity of the (−) stereoisomer. The stereoisomers used were (−)-trans-(1S,2S)-U-50488 HCl and (+)-trans-(1R,2R)-U-50488 HCl. trans trans trans trans Materials & methods Designs were prospective, blind, randomised, intention-to-treat and compared the efficacy of 2 indistinguishable treatments. The outcome was the difference in survival. Potency ‘chords’ consisting of 4th, 12th and 30th approximately centesimal dilutions were prepared, representing concentrations of 1.08 × 10−10 M. One study compared inhibition of (−)-U-50488 toxicity injected ip at the estimated LD50 into male ICR mice, treated with a potency chord of the same stereoisomer, with control (‘isopathic’ study). The other study compared inhibition of toxicity by potency chords made from the stereoisomers (+)-U-50488 and (−)-U-50488 (‘enantiomer’ study), Treatments were administered orally on 11 occasions: twice before and nine times after ip injections. −10 −10 Results The isopathic study did not yield a significant result. In the enantiomer study, comparison of isopathy with enantiomer potency treatment showed a highly significant difference odds ratio 1.97 (95% CI: 1.23–3.14). Conclusion We conclude that enantiomeric potencies are superior to identically produced isopathic potencies, in inhibiting toxicity of (−)-U-50488 HCl. Homeopathic inhibition of toxicity may be stereospecific. "
"UK medical students spend 25% of their curricular time on elective “Student Selected Components” (SSCs). We report one in homeopathic medicine run jointly by the University of Bristol and the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. The SSC was an intensive four week course using a variety of learning methods, grounded in the Faculty of Homeopathy's Primary Health Care Examination (PHCE) Certificate syllabus. Students were exposed to specialist clinics and the prescribing methods used in them. They received tuition from a veterinarian, a psychiatrist, a medical historian, a professional homeopath and an expert in the evidence base of complementary medicine. Educational methods included interactive lectures, out-patient clinics, recorded video cases, live cases via video link, a “dream proving” and a reflective diary. At the end of the course students sat and passed the Faculty's PHC examination. Assessment also included an in-depth case report in which most students revealed understanding of the course. Though students were uncertain about the nature of the healing stimulus, many were affected by the healing responses they witnessed and the intellectual challenge of remedy selection. Some professed interest in further training and all wished to see the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital (BHH) develop as a centre for holistic care. For some the experience was “transformative learning”. We conclude that this approach to a foundation training in homeopathy is feasible and effective. via via "
"The development of homeopathic repertories is complex, reflecting history, the emergence of divergent views on homeopathic philosophy, and differences in opinion as to what constitutes reliable materia medica. The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the content of repertories examining its reliability, the quality of source material, and the evidence that it forms a reliable bridge between case and materia medica. Reliability may be improved by demanding higher standards and consistency of evidence. However, it is necessary to understand what constitutes evidence, and the importance of taking into account the context in which practitioners use the repertory. This paper will suggest that rather than demanding certain ‘standards’, practitioners will be better served by a greater understanding of the sources of knowledge and by reflexivity of the key players in the construction of our repertories. ‘The repertory’ is considered generally here as the deconstruction of different repertories. The strengths and weaknesses in particular, whilst interesting, would be the topic of another a paper in its own right. Where individual repertories are mentioned, they are referred to as examples only. "
"Background After prospective assessment of six homeopathic symptoms we validated some rubrics of the homeopathic repertory using Bayesian theory. In this paper we introduce statistical arguments for introducing or discarding entries from the repertory. Methods 4094 patients entered the prospective study and 4072 prescriptions were evaluated. After translating typeface into Likelihood Ratios (LRs), Confidence Intervals and the probability of existing repertory entries compared to our findings were calculated. Outcome Our assessment yielded 121 relevant results to validate existing repertory entries. Five symptoms could be compared with Kent's original repertory; they have about the same prevalence (range 3.9–6.5%) in the whole population, but the size of the corresponding repertory rubrics varies from 3 to 103 entries. LR assessment reduced the larger rubrics and supplemented the smaller ones. Our results do not correspond with 56% of the existing repertory entries regarding five symptom-rubrics. This result cannot be generalised for the whole repertory. "
"Introduction The Swiss randomised controlled trial of homeopathy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was a rigorous test of homeopathy. In each of its three phases it delivered evidence for a specific effect of homeopathic treatment, but it also unmasked weaknesses of the method. Misleading reports of sensations and mind symptoms by parents were frequent, while modalities and polar symptoms usually proved to be reliable information for repertorisation. The problem of cases with a paucity of symptoms was resolved by reintroduction of (pathognomonic) perception symptoms into the repertorisation. Additionally polarity analysis, a further development of Boenninghausen's concept of contraindications, was tested and introduced. It allows a precise differential diagnosis of possible homeopathic medicines. Increasing the rate of optimal prescriptions by 20%, polarity analysis turned out to be the most efficient modification to case analysis. This paper describes the transfer of the new insights to the treatment of other diseases and as the evaluation of this process. Methods Polarity analysis was tested and applied in acute diseases by completing patient histories with repertory specific checklists, mainly based on modalities and polar symptoms. The checklists encompassed eleven different complaints. Treatment results were compared with results reached by conventional homeopathic case analysis methods. The same procedure was applied in chronic diseases with repertory-specific questionnaires. Again, eleven different areas were covered. Treatment results for chronic diseases were also compared with a conventional case analysis approach. Results Polarity analysis, checklists and questionnaires led to an increase in optimal prescriptions of 22% in acute diseases and 16% in chronic diseases. In addition, the average improvement rates in chronic disease were 9% higher than with conventional homeopathic procedures. The new method is demonstrated by a case example with a verified clinical cure, and its impacts on homeopathy are discussed. Conclusion The use of polarity analysis as an integral part of case analysis and differential diagnosis of possible remedies together with an increased awareness for assessing the reliability of symptoms in repertorisation lead to a substantial improvement in the precision of homeopathic prescriptions.

"Using intuitionistic fuzzy set theory, Sanchez's approach to medical diagnosis has been applied to the problem of selection of single remedy from homeopathic repertorization. Two types of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Relations (IFRs) and three types of selection indices are discussed. I also propose a new repertory exploiting the benefits of soft-intelligence. "
"Methods The feasibility and outcomes of homeopathic therapy in a group of type-2 diabetes mellitus patients with diabetic neuropathy were studied in a prospective observational study. Patients were followed from baseline (T0) for 6 months (T1) and for 12 months (T2), treatment was adjusted as necessary. Primary outcome was diabetic neuropathy symptom (DNS) score, secondary outcomes were clinical evolution and short-form-36 (SF-36)-evaluated quality of life (QOL). Results Homeopathy was used in 45 patients, 32 of whom completed the observation study, and in parallel the conventional therapy outcomes were observed in 32 patients, 29 of whom completed the study. DNS improved in both groups during the observation period, but the change with respect to baseline was statistically significant only in Homeopathic group at T1 (P = 0.016). Over the course of the observation there was a substantial stability of the electroneurophysiological values, blood pressure and body weight in both groups, a slight decrease of fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin in Homeopathic group. QOL scores showed an improvement in Homeopathic group only. The cost of conventional drugs decreased in Homeopathic group from 114 €/month to 94 €/month at T1. P P Conclusion Complementary homeopathic therapy of diabetic neuropathy was feasible and promising effects in symptom scores and cost savings were observed. "
"Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted on 105 out of 233 patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease attending the Homeopathic Clinic of the Campo di Marte Hospital in Lucca (Tuscany, Italy) between October 1998 and May 2003. We assessed the cost of conventional medicinal products using Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, specific for the pathology in question, and the general costs in the year preceding the first appointment at the Homeopathic Clinic vs. the first and second year subsequent to homeopathic treatment. The costs of conventional drugs for a group of patients affected by asthma (8 patients) and recurrent respiratory infections (16 patients) with long term use of conventional medicine treated by homeopathy were compared with the expenses of conventional drugs of a matched group of 16 and 32 patients, respectively. vs. vs. Results Costs of pharmacological therapy specific for respiratory diseases were reduced by 46.3% (n = 105) in the first year (P < 0.01); and by 47.5% (n = 72) in the second year (P < 0.01) of homeopathic treatment. Reduction in general drug costs during homeopathic therapy was 42.4% in the first year (P < 0.01); and −49.8 in the second year (N.S.). Costs for patients affected by chronic asthma showed a reduction in expenses of 71.1% for specific medicines relative to the group in homeopathic treatment vs. an increase of 12.3% in the group treated only with conventional drugs after the first year of follow-up and, respectively, a reduction of −54.4% for homeopathic treatment vs. +45.2% after the second year. For patients with recurrent respiratory infections we found a reduction of 35.8% in the homeopathic group in the first year, compared to an increase 8.6% of costs for specific drugs in the control group; in the second year the respective figures were −43.6% versus +7.8% in the control group. n P n P P vs. vs versus n P n P P vs. vs versus Conclusions Homeopathic treatment for respiratory diseases (asthma, allergic complaints, Acute Recurrent Respiratory Infections) was associated with a significant reduction in the use and costs of conventional drugs. Costs for homeopathic therapy are significantly lower than those for conventional pharmacological therapy. "

"Background Quality of life (QoL) is an important outcome measure in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), a condition for which homeopathy is frequently used. Objective The assessment of the effect of homeopathic medical prescriptions with the Rhino-conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) in the treatment of SAR. Methods A prospective, open, non-comparative study was conducted in Belgium. Patients aged between 14 and 68 years with SAR were treated by one of seven homeopathic physicians. Patients completed the RQLQ at baseline and again after three and four weeks of homeopathic treatment. Results Seventy-four patients were screened, of whom 46 met the study eligibility criteria (average age 36 years, 70% female). The mean RQLQ score at baseline was 3.40 (±.98). After three and four weeks of homeopathic treatment it had fallen to 1.97 (±1.32) (P = 0.0001), and 1.6 (±1.28) (P = 0.0001), respectively. P P P P Conclusions After homeopathic treatment, patients reported an alleviation of their symptoms of allergic rhinitis as reported in the RQLQ.

"Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection is the only conventional medical treatment available for patients with spasmodic dysphonia (SD). Some patients are reluctant to receive Botox treatment due to concerns about unknown long-term side effects, expense, and dependence on repeated injections. The purpose of the study was to report the perceptual and physiological changes in the vocal functions of an SD patient treated with classical homeopathy. The results were similar to a previous case report: classical homeopathy seems to be capable of amelioratiny SD symptoms beyond the short-term effects of Botox injections. Although the physiological mechanism of homeopathic healing is not fully accounted for by the current bio-medical models, it may be an effective therapeutic alternative for some SD patients. "

"Introduction Canova (CA) is a homeopathic medication with immunomodulatory properties, recommended for patients with a depressed immune system. CA has been reported to increase in leukocyte numbers, cellular differentiation and reduction in tumor size. Canova Canova Aim and method Since CA may stimulate lymphocyte differentiation, proliferation, and/or survival, the aim of the present study was to compare the mitotic index (MI) of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured in a medium supplemented with human macrophages activated by CA, with lymphocytes cultured in a medium without CA-treated macrophages. Results In this study, the MI of lymphocyte cultured received the medium containing CA-stimulated macrophages showed a higher proliferation index (p < 0.01) than the lymphocytes cultured in a medium without CA-treated macrophages. Our results suggest that CA treatment, in addition to activating macrophages, indirectly induces lymphocyte proliferation and has potential as a new adjuvant therapeutic approach. p p "
"Objectives To study the characteristics of people visiting homeopaths in a total adult population in Norway. Methods Data from a total population cross sectional health survey conducted in 1995–1997 in Central Norway (HUNT 2) with 65,495 participants. Variables included in the analysis were age, marital status, education, being a social welfare recipient, lifestyle (daily smoker), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-T), global health perception, self-reported health complaints and a variety of diseases. Significance level p < 0.01. p p Results 40,027 persons over 20 years answered the question on visits to a homeopath. 4.3% had consulted a homeopath during the last 12 months. The likelihood of a person consulting a homeopath was most strongly associated with being female (adjusted odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 2.1–2.6) and having a lower perceived global health (increasing from 1.5, 1.2–1.8 for good global health to 2.9, 1.9–4.3 for poor global health). There was a weaker but significant association between increased likelihood of visiting a homeopath and being 30–39 years (1.3, 1.1–1.4), having a HADS-T score between 10–14 (1.3, 1.1–1.6) and 15–19 (1.6, 1.3–2.0), having a health complaint the last year (1.5, 1.2–1.7), hay fever (1.7, 1.5–2.0), consulted for a psychiatric complaint (1.5, 1.3–1.8) and another chronic disease than the ones asked about in this study (1.3, 1.1–1.6). Being a smoker was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of consulting a homeopath (0.7, 0.6–0.7). There was also a trend for increased likelihood of visits to homeopaths (p < 0.1) for those 60 years and over, social welfare recipients, having a chronic complaint and HADS-T score of 20 or higher, and decreased likelihood for widow(er)s. p p Conclusions and proposals Being female and having a lower perceived global health were the variables most strongly associated with visits to a homeopath. More studies on visits to homeopaths from other populations (countries, children and adolescent) are needed. "
"Aim To evaluate the zootechnic performance and occurrence of diarrhea in piglets in the week post-weaning comparing supplementation with sucrose saline which contained or did not contain added homeopathic medicine. Method Animals were randomly divided into three groups of 24 piglets each. The control group did not receive any treatment. Another group received sucrose saline, and the third group received sucrose saline with homeopathic medicine added, in the period of zero to seven days post-weaning. The homeopathic treatment consisted of Echinacea angustifolia, Avena sativa, Ignatia amara, Calcarea carbonica, all 6cH. Piglets were weighed daily for weight gain or loss, and observed for diarrhea and feed intake. Echinacea angustifolia Avena sativa Ignatia amara, Calcarea carbonica Echinacea angustifolia Avena sativa Ignatia amara, Calcarea carbonica Results Animals receiving sucrose saline alone and sucrose saline with homeopathy had less weight loss than control (p = 0.017, p = 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistical difference in relation to overall incidence of diarrhea or food consumption. These data suggest that the supplementation with sucrose saline with added homeopathic medicine in the first seven days post-weaning may be an useful option to reduce weight loss in weaned piglets. p p p p "
"How can Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) change our beliefs? The fact that they do update prior beliefs to different posterior beliefs is explained by Bayesian philosophy. Crucial points in Bayesian analysis include setting the first prior expectation right and sequential updating of the prior in the light of new evidence. Bayesian analysis depends highly on the evidence included. RCT evidence can only falsify the placebo hypothesis, it cannot indicate which mechanism of action could be responsible for an intrinsic effect and therefore cannot overturn existing beliefs. Bayesian reasoning could structure further discussion, but subjectivity is an inherent element of this process. In the case of homeopathy the first prior is not a common prior shared by all parties to the debate, but a paradigm, this prevents common updating of beliefs. Only by keeping an open mind towards other paradigms and all possible hypotheses can a low Bayesian prior be elevated to the point of accepting a new paradigm, this is more relevant than Bayesian calculations.

"Background There is a discrepancy between the outcome of a meta-analysis published in 1997 of 89 trials of homeopathy by Linde et al and an analysis of 110 trials by Shang et al published in 2005, these reached opposite conclusions. Important data were not mentioned in Shang et al's paper, but only provided subsequently. Questions What was the outcome of Shang et al's predefined hypotheses? Were the homeopathic and conventional trials comparable? Was subgroup selection justified? The possible role of ineffective treatments. Was the conclusion about effect justified? Were essential data missing in the original article? Methods Analysis of post-publication data. Re-extraction and analysis of 21 higher quality trials selected by Shang et al with sensitivity analysis for the influence of single indications. Analysis of comparability. Sensitivity analysis of influence of subjective choices, like quality of single indications and of cut-off values for ‘larger samples’. Results The quality of trials of homeopathy was better than of conventional trials. Regarding smaller trials, homeopathy accounted for 14 out of 83 and conventional medicine 2 out of 78 good quality trials with n < 100. There was selective inclusion of unpublished trials only for homeopathy. Quality was assessed differently from previous analyses. Selecting subgroups on sample size and quality caused incomplete matching of homeopathy and conventional trials. Cut-off values for larger trials differed between homeopathy and conventional medicine without plausible reason. Sensitivity analyses for the influence of heterogeneity and the cut-off value for ‘larger higher quality studies’ were missing. Homeopathy is not effective for muscle soreness after long distance running, OR = 1.30 (95% CI 0.96–1.76). The subset of homeopathy trials on which the conclusion was based was heterogeneous, comprising 8 trials on 8 different indications, and was not matched on indication with those of conventional medicine. Essential data were missing in the original paper. n n Conclusion Re-analysis of Shang's post-publication data did not support the conclusion that homeopathy is a placebo effect. The conclusion that homeopathy is and that conventional is not a placebo effect was not based on comparative analysis and not justified because of heterogeneity and lack of sensitivity analysis. If we confine ourselves to the predefined hypotheses and the part of the analysis that is indeed comparative, the conclusion should be that quality of homeopathic trials is better than of conventional trials, for all trials (p = 0.03) as well as for smaller trials (p = 0.003). p p p p "
"Homeopathy has been used for more than two hundred years to treat chronic disease using various approaches in a wide range of diseases. However, for acute disease and critical illness, application has been limited by inadequate training of homeopathic physicians and the small number of pertinent clinical studies. In view of the difficulty of practising homeopathy in Intensive Care Units (ICU), a protocol was developed to facilitate description of objective homeopathic symptoms with a ranking of symptoms appropriate for these situations (Protocol for Objective Homeopathic Semiology). Examples of favorable results with individualized homeopathic treatments for a series of cases of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (sepsis) are described.

"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the homeopathic complex Homeopatila RS® (REAL Homeopathy, Brazil), in the performance, sexual proportion and gills and liver histology of the Nile tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus L.). 4,800 post-larvae were treated for 45 days, in 12 tanks (500 L), in a closed environment, with density of 400 larvae per tank. Three treatments were given: alcohol 30%, negative control (C); hormonal, positive control, 17α-methyltestosterone (H); homeopathic, Homeopatila RS®, in ethanol (HH), with four replications. Mean values for length, weight, liver somatic index, condition factor, survival rate, average values of histological alterations and sexual proportion were determined. Analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) in growth, survival rate, liver somatic index and average values of hepatic histological alterations between treatments. It was concluded that the addition of Homeopatila RS® to the diet of Nile tilapias, during the phase of gonadal differentiation, did not induce any alteration in the sexual proportion. Homeopathically treated fish were significantly smaller, but had significantly greater survival than the other two groups, there was no significant difference in final total biomass. The homeopathically treated fish had a lower liver/somatic index with less hepatic lipid inclusions than the other groups.

"Background Trituration of base substances, commonly to the 3cH level, is the cornerstone of the homeopathic pharmaceutical process or insoluble solutions.1 Becker and Ehrler claim that trituration to 4cH gives a new, spiritual dimension to the homoeopathic medicine picture.2 1 2 1 2 Aim and method This study sought to establish whether the claim that C4-derived potencies possess different physicochemical qualities to the homoeopathic medicines derived from a 3cH trituration is valid. All potencies were produced by hand according to the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP). Five different samples were analysed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Results The results indicated a significant difference between the 12cH samples of potassium dichromate (Kalium bichromicum) produced from 3cH and 4cH triturations. This was especially prominent in the chemical shift values of all four peaks and the relative integration levels of the H2O, OH and CH3 peaks when comparing two sample groups. Kalium bichromicum 2 3 Kalium bichromicum 2 3 Conclusion Trituration plays a part in the development of physicochemical properties specific to homoeopathic medicines. The higher the level of trituration, the more pronounced is the alteration of the physical structure of the active ingredient. The study concludes that 4cH potencies are physicochemically distinct from 3cH-derived potencies (as currently employed). "
"Objective This study attempts to evaluate the status of oxidative stress in osteoarthritis (OA), by measuring some parameters of oxidant stress and antioxidant defenses in blood, before and after homeopathy treatment, and to asses the role, if any, of homeopathic treatment in modulating free radical toxicity in OA. Methods Erythrocyte lipid peroxidation (LP), erythrocyte antioxidants viz., glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CT) and plasma antioxidants viz., ceruloplasmin, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), vitamin C, total antioxidant activity (AOA) were determined in eighty one patients with OA and fifty three normals. Forty seven patients, who were treated with homeopathic remedies were considered for the follow-up studies. Location Father Muller Homeopathic Hospital, Mangalore, South Karnataka, India. Results Erythrocyte LP (0 hour, p < 0.001; 2 hours, p < 0.01; and susceptibility to LP, p < 0.05) and SOD (p < 0.05) were significantly higher, whereas plasma vitamin C (p < 0.01) and AOA (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in OA patients when compared to controls. In follow-up patients the erythrocyte LP (0 hour, p < 0.01; 2 hours, p < 0.01; and susceptibility to LP, p < 0.01) and SOD (p < 0.01) were significantly lower when compared to their pretreatment values. Plasma vitamin C attained a normal range. The AOA activity after treatment was not significantly different from that observed before treatment. p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p Conclusion Oxidative stress increased in OA as indicated by increased LP, SOD, decreased vitamin C and AOA. On homeopathic treatment the LP has decreased in the erythrocytes which shows and reduced oxidative stress. This is further evidenced by returning of plasma vitamin C and erythrocyte SOD to the normal levels, but oxidant stress has not been completely overcome as plasma AOA remained low after treatment. "
"Introduction We report findings from a pilot data collection study within a programme of quality assurance, improvement and development across all five homeopathic hospitals in the UK National Health Service (NHS). Aims (1) To pilot the collection of clinical data in the homeopathic hospital outpatient setting, recording patient-reported outcome since first appointment; (2) to sample the range of medical complaints that secondary-care doctors treat using homeopathy, and thus identify the nature and complexity of complaints most frequently treated nationally; (3) to present a cross section of outcome scores by appointment number, including that for the most frequently treated medical complaints; (4) to explore approaches to standard setting for homeopathic practice outcome in patients treated at the homeopathic hospitals. Methods A total of 51 medical practitioners took part in data collection over a 4-week period. Consecutive patient appointments were recorded under the headings: (1) date of first appointment in the current series; (2) appointment number; (3) age of patient; (4) sex of patient; (5) main medical complaint being treated; (6) whether other main medical complaint(s); (7) patient-reported change in health, using Outcome Related to Impact on Daily Living (ORIDL) and its derivative, the ORIDL Profile Score (ORIDL-PS; range, –4 to +4, where a score ≤−2 or ≥+2 indicates an effect on the quality of a patient's daily life); (8) receipt of other complementary medicine for their main medical complaint. ORIDL Profile Score ORIDL Profile Score Results The distribution of patient age was bimodal: main peak, 49 years; secondary peak, 6 years. Male:female ratio was 1:3.5. Data were recorded on a total of 1797 individual patients: 195 first appointments, 1602 follow-ups (FUs). Size of clinical service and proportion of patients who attended more than six visits varied between hospitals. A total of 235 different medical complaints were reported. The 30 most commonly treated complaints were (in decreasing order of frequency): eczema; chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); menopausal disorder; osteoarthritis; depression; breast cancer; rheumatoid arthritis; asthma; anxiety; irritable bowel syndrome; multiple sclerosis; psoriasis; allergy (unspecified); fibromyalgia; migraine; premenstrual syndrome; chronic rhinitis; headache; vitiligo; seasonal allergic rhinitis; chronic intractable pain; insomnia; ulcerative colitis; acne; psoriatic arthropathy; urticaria; ovarian cancer; attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); epilepsy; sinusitis. The proportion of patients with important co-morbidity was higher in those seen after visit 6 (56.9%) compared with those seen up to and including that point (40.7%; P < 0.001). The proportion of FU patients reporting ORIDL-PS ≥ +2 (improvement affecting daily living) increased overall with appointment number: 34.5% of patients at visit 2 and 59.3% of patients at visit 6, for example. Amongst the four most frequently treated complaints, the proportion of patients that reported ORIDL-PS ≥ +2 at visit numbers greater than 6 varied between 59.3% (CFS) and 73.3% (menopausal disorder). P P Conclusions We have successfully piloted a process of national clinical data collection using patient-reported outcome in homeopathic hospital outpatients, identifying a wide range and complexity of medical complaints treated in that setting. After a series of homeopathy appointments, a high proportion of patients, often representing “effectiveness gaps” for conventional medical treatment, reported improvement in health affecting their daily living. These pilot findings are informing our developing programme of standard setting for homeopathic care in the hospital outpatient context. "
"The behavioral and hematological effects of treatment with Chamomilla 6cH in mice subjected to experimental stress are described. Swiss mice were randomly divided into pairs, one animal was inoculated with Ehrlich's tumor, the other was treated daily with Chamomilla 6cH or control or received no treatment. After 7 days, the animals were observed in an open-field arena and blood samples taken. Mice who cohabitated with a sick cage-mate showed a decrease in their general activity, but those treated with Chamomilla 6cH were less severely affected (p = 0.0426). No hematological changes were observed. Chamomilla Chamomilla Chamomilla p In a second experiment, the forced swimming test was applied to mice pre-treated with Chamomilla 6cH, controls were: water, 10% ethanol or amitriptyline. Only the amitriptyline and ethanol treated groups showed significant excitatory behavior (p = 0.0020), Chamomilla 6cH treated animals' scores intermediate between water control and ethanol or amitriptyline. A decrease in the leukocyte count was observed in the amitriptyline and Chamomilla 6cH treated groups (p = 0.039).

"The therapeutic effects of the plant species used in homeopathy have never been subjected to systematic analysis. A survey of the various Materiae Medicae shows that over 800 plant species are the source of medicines in homeopathy. As these medicines are considered related to one another with respect to their therapeutic effects for treating similar symptoms, the aim is to classify and map them using the concept of homology. This involves placing the discipline of homeopathy into a comparative framework using these plant medicines as taxa, therapeutic effects as characters, and contemporary cladistic techniques to analyse these relationships. The results are compared using cladograms based on different data sets used in biology (e.g. morphological characters and DNA sequences) to test whether similar cladistic patterns exist among these medicines. By classifying the therapeutic actions, genuine homologies can be distinguished from homoplasies. As this is a comparative study it has been necessary first to update the existing nomenclature of the plant species in the homeopathic literature in line with the current International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.

"This study evaluated the effects of homeopathic treatment on control of Haemonchus contortus infection in sheep. Twenty lambs were randomized to three treatments: treated with the homeopathic medicines, Ferrum phosphoricum, Arsenicum album and Calcarea carbonica; treated with a conventional antihelminthic, doramectin, and an untreated control group. Fecal and blood samples were taken from each animal on days 18, 38 and 68 after start of treatment. Haemonchus contortus Ferrum phosphoricum Arsenicum album Calcarea carbonica A significant reduction in number of H. contortus larvae (p < 0.01) was observed for animals in the homeopathic treatment group compared to the control group. Fecal egg counts showed negative correlation between haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations in the homeopathic treatment group (p < 0.01); however, the biochemical and immunological parameters showed better correlation, indicating that the homeopathic medicine improved vital functions. Daily weight gain in the homeopathic treatment group was superior to the control and to the antihelminthic groups, 31 and 6.5%, respectively.

"There are active public campaigns both for and against homeopathy, and its continuing availability in the NHS is debated in the medical, scientific and popular press. However, there is a lack of clarity in key terms used in the debate, and in how the evidence base of homeopathy is described and interpreted. The term ‘homeopathy’ is used with several different meanings including: the therapeutic system, homeopathic medicine, treatment by a homeopath, and the principles of ‘homeopathy’. Conclusions drawn from one of these aspects are often inappropriately applied to another aspect. In interpreting the homeopathy evidence it is important to understand that the existing clinical experimental (randomised controlled trial) evidence base provides evidence as to the efficacy of homeopathic medicines, but not the effectiveness of treatment by a homeopath. The observational evidence base provides evidence as to the effectiveness of treatment by a homeopath. We make four recommendations to promote clarity in the reporting, design and interpretation of homeopathy research. "
"This article examines homeopathic practitioners ‘real life’ accounts, and illustrates the ways in which they negotiate their homeopathic practices as contingently formulated ongoing social events in research interview settings. Interview transcripts were analysed in a qualitative framework using discourse analysis. The findings show that practitioners construct homeopathy and defend their own individual practices either by ‘alignment-with-medicine’ or by ‘boosting-the-credibility-of-homeopathy’. Homeopathy is also negotiated and sustained as an ‘alternative’ to notions of conventional medicine, which is the accepted yardstick for practice or as a practice that is portrayed as problematic. Overall, managing personal credibility is accomplished through specific ways of accounting that tend to marginalise homeopathy. Developing and establishing homeopathic practice further as a discipline in its own right is offered as a ‘nucleus’ to reduce continuing marginalisation. "
"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, involves immunomediated processes. Canova (CA) is a homeopathic treatment indicated in the diseases in which the immune system is depressed. This study evaluated the Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profile of T. cruzi under the influence of CA and Benznidazole (BZ). Mice infected with the genetic lineage of T. cruzi II (Y strain) were divided into 4 groups: Trypanosoma cruzi Canova CA T. cruzi CA T. cruzi Infected animals treated with saline solution (control group); treated with CA; treated with BZ; treated with CA and BZ combined. CA BZ CA Treatment was given at the 5th–25th days of infection (D5–25). The parasites were isolated by haemoculture in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium: at D5 (before treatment), D13, 15 and 25 (during treatment) and D55 and 295 (after treatment). DNA was extracted from the mass of parasites. RAPD was done with the primers λgt11-F, M13F-40 and L15996, the amplified products were eletrophoresed through a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Data were analyzed by the coefficient of similarity using the DNA-POP program. 163 markers were identified, 5 of them monomorphic. CA did not act against the parasites when used alone. The RAPD profiles of parasites treated with BZ and CA + BZ were different from those in the control group and in the group treated with CA. The actions of the CA and BZ were different and the action of BZ was different from the action of CA + BZ. These data suggest that CA may interact with BZ. The differences in the RAPD profile of the Y strain of T. cruzi produced by BZ, CA + BZ and the natural course of the infection suggest selection/suppression of populations.

"In criticising papers which recently appeared in Homeopathy, Leick claims that no double blind randomised clinical trials (DBRCTs) show that homeopathy is efficacious, and that specific effects of substances diluted beyond Avogadro's limit are implausible. He states that generalised entanglement models should be able to improve the design of experiments to test ultra-high dilutions, and disparages the authors' understandings of quantum physics. The paper responds to those criticisms. Several DBRCTs have shown that homeopathy has effects which are not due to placebo and these are now supported by preclinical work. This area of theory is in its infancy and it is unreasonable to expect it to have generated experiments at this stage. The authors have used accepted interpretations of quantum theory: Leick's view is coloured by skepticism concerning homeopathy. "
"The study and practice of medicine, in its most personal and intimate functions, its most sophisticated scientific and technological manifestations, and its philosophical and ethical ramifications, are central to our understanding of the human condition. Homeopathic medicine: its insights, the questions that it begs, and the scientific and philosophical challenges it presents, has a significant contribution to make to this process. To be actively and seriously engaged with homeopathy is an adventurous undertaking. It is to be engaged in exploring both human nature and the nature of the world we inhabit. And in that process we are also engaged in the pursuit of truth and the exploration of reality. This paper deals first with the layout of the playing field on which homeopathy has to compete to be taken seriously. It then discusses three concepts: reality, truth and knowledge, which are objectives for which we strive and principles that guide us in that striving. In the third part it introduces the concept of ‘personal knowledge’ as an essential ingredient of scientific discovery and the pursuit of truth. And finally it proposes that the homeopathic community in general, and the Faculty of Homeopathy in particular, must expand its vision with a definition of a new paradigm, the new model of healthcare and medical science to which the vision aspires.

"Homeopathy is being attacked by the British media. These attacks draw support from irresponsible and unjustified claims by certain teachers of homeopathy. Such claims include the use of ‘dream’ and ‘imaginative’ methods for provings. For prescribing some such teachers attempt to replace the laborious process of matching symptom picture and remedy with spurious theories based on ‘signatures’, sensations and other methods. Other irresponsible claims have also been made. These “new ideas” risk destroying the principles, theory, and practice of homeopathy. "
"The healthcare programmes of the Region of Tuscany, Italy have contained references to various types of non-conventional medicine since 1996, and the last three Regional Health Plans have includes a chapter on non-conventional medicine that arguably represent the greatest degree of integration of such therapies in the public health care system achieved thus far in Italy. The Plan aims to guarantee definitive integration in the Regional Health Service of types of non-conventional medicine which are supported by a sufficient level of scientific evidence to allow them to be defined as forms of complementary medicine (acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy and manual medicine). Moreover, in 2007 the Regional council of Tuscany, for the first time in Italy, approved a regional law disciplining the pratice of complementary medicines on the part of doctors, dentists, Veterinarians and pharmacists.

"Most debates in science and the humanities that cannot be settled are not about truth, nor about data, but about beliefs and world views. Philippe Leick's comment on entanglement models of homeopathy are a good example. Because of this, no argument, however, convincing to some, will settle that debate. The only thing that can resolve it is a large cultural shift. My own ideas about non-local models, for a whole category of possibly similar events of which homeopathy is but one example. "

Trypanosoma cruzi Trypanosoma cruzi Methods Eighty adult male C57BL/6 inbred mice were randomly allocated to five groups treated with biotherapy (nosode) of T. cruzi 12dH (12×) pre- and post-infection; Phosphorus 12dH post-infection; infected control treated with control solution and uninfected control. The biotherapy was prepared by the Costa method from the blood of mice experimentally infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Phosphorus was used because of its clinical and reportorial similarity to Chagas disease. T. cruzi (104) sanguineous forms were inoculated intraperitoneally per animal. Parasitaemia was monitored, leukocyte and serological responses were evaluated at 0, 7, 14 and 42 days after infection. The prepatent and patent periods of parasitaemia, maximum of parasitaemia, day of maximum parasitaemia and mortality rates were compared between groups. T. cruzi Phosphorus T. cruzi Phosphorus T. cruzi 4 T. cruzi Phosphorus T. cruzi Phosphorus T. cruzi 4 Results A significantly shorter period of patent parasitaemia was observed in the group treated with the biotherapy before infection (p < 0.05) than in the other groups. This group also had the lowest parasitaemias values at 9, 13, 15 (p < 0.05), 17 (p < 0.05), 22, 24 and 28 days, a lower rate of mortality and a significant increase of lymphocytes compared to the infected control group. The Phosphorus group had the longest period of patent parasitaemia, higher maximum parasitaemia, and a significant reduction of lymphocyte numbers, but no mortality. The infected control group had the highest mortality rate (not statistically significant), and the highest IgG titres at 42 days post-infection (p < 0.05). p p p Phosphorus p p p p Phosphorus p Conclusions The results suggest that pre-treatment with biotherapy modulates host immune response to T. cruzi, mainly during the acute phase of the infection. Phosphorus shows an action on the pathogenicity by T. cruzi infection. Homeopathic treatment of T. cruzi infection should be further investigated.

"This is an edited transcript of a debate held at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, USA on 25 October 2007. Homeopathy is a widely used but controversial form of complementary and alternative medicine. Six distinguished international speakers, including advocates and skeptics concerning homeopathy, debated the plausibility, theoretical principles, clinical and basic research evidence, ethical and other issues surrounding homeopathy.

"The criteria for entering medicines in repertory rubrics are unclear and partly incorrect. A new repertory should be based on clear and objective criteria. Retrospective and prospective assessment of medicines and symptoms by the Dutch Committee for Methods and Validation gives an indication of the validity of existing repertory entries. Reliance on the experience of one expert is the cause of part of the shortcomings of the repertory. This experience is highly influenced by chance. Another part is due to the use of absolute rather than relative occurrence of symptoms. Yet another part is caused by not comparing prevalence in the population ‘cured’ by a medicine with the remainder of the population. In many cases we need better definitions of symptoms. A clear protocol and prospective research could overcome many shortcomings of the repertory. Statistics help to get more objective criteria, but we still need to reach consensus about how to handle probabilities of outcomes of our assessments. "
"Background: Previous experiments show that amphibian larvae are responsive to homeopathically prepared thyroxine. Background Methods: We studied the effect of a highly diluted and agitated thyroxine solution exposed to various electromagnetic fields on metamorphosis in highland Rana temporaria. The devices tested were: microwave oven, mobile phone, airport X-ray, and a red light barcode scanner. Animals were treated either with homeopathically prepared thyroxine (10−30 parts by weight, 10−35 in the water in which the animals were kept), or analogously prepared blank solution, or analogously prepared thyroxine exposed to the electromagnetic field of one of the devices tested. Solutions were administered at 48 h intervals according to a standardized protocol. Methods Rana temporaria −30 −35 Results: Animals treated with the standard test solution thyroxine 10−30 metamorphosed more slowly than the control animals, ie the effect of the homeopathically prepared thyroxine was opposed to the usual physiological effect of molecular thyroxine. The cumulative number of test animals that had reached the four-legged stage at defined points in time was smaller in the group treated with homeopathically prepared thyroxine at most of the points in time. This was found independently by all three research teams involved. Results −30 In contrast, this effect did not occur when the thyroxine solution had been exposed to the field of the early model microwave oven, or mobile phone.

"Objective There is great controversy concerning treatment for menopausal symptoms. We evaluated homeopathic treatments for hot flushes and their effect on quality of life in menopausal women. menopausal symptoms menopausal symptoms Methods Open, multi-national prospective, pragmatic and non-comparative observational study of homeopathic treatments prescribed and their effectiveness, observing their impact on quality of life. Results Ninety-nine physicians in 8 countries took part in this study and included 438 patients with an average age of 55. Homeopathic medicines were prescribed to all patients; 98% of the prescription lines were for homeopathic medicines. Lachesis mutus, Belladonna, Sepia officinalis, Sulphur and Sanguinaria canadensis were the most prescribed. A non-homeopathic treatment and/or food supplement prescribed for 5% of the patients. Lachesis mutus, Belladonna, Sepia officinalis Sulphur Sanguinaria canadensis This observational study revealed a significant reduction (p<0.001) in the frequency of hot flushes by day and night and a significant reduction in the daily discomfort they caused (mean fall of 3.6 and 3.8 points respectively, on a 10 cm visual analogue scale; p<0.001). p p Ninety percent of the women reported disappearance or lessening of their symptoms, these changes mostly taking place within 15 days of starting homeopathic treatment.

Further studies including randomized controlled trials should be conducted. "
"Objective To investigate the conceptions of health and illness, the reasons for seeking homeopathy and continuing treatment, compliance and the meaning of the relationship between religiosity and health for patients who adhere to homeopathy. Methods A qualitative study of 20 adult patients in Santos (Brazil) treated by homeopaths in the public and private sector for at least 2 years. Semi-structured interviews, organized by predefined thematic categories, the content of the interviews was analyzed. Results The conceptions of health and illness of the interviewed patients are related to the idea of vital balance/imbalance mediated by body–mind interaction. Dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, family influence and suggestions of others were the reasons for seeking homeopathic treatment. Patients continued homeopathic treatment due to positive therapeutic results, cure without being aggressive to the organism, the holistic integrated approach, the preventive nature of the treatment and low prices of medicine. For these patients, the availability of homeopathy in the public health sector extends the possibility of access. The need for a wider dissemination of homeopathy and the difficulties in following the prescription are the main problems involved in continuing treatment. Faith is an important component. We found a correlation between the conceptions of health and illness and the principles of homeopathy, assimilated through a strong bond between patients and the homeopathic practitioners. Conclusion To investigate the beliefs, values and meanings that patients attribute to homeopathy helps to understand subjective aspects that may interfere with treatment compliance. "

"The HomBRex database indexes basic research on homeopathy (www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex). It includes research on effects of homeopathic preparations in bioassays and physico-chemical effects of the homeopathic preparation process (potentization). At the end of 2006 it contained more than 1100 experiments in more than 900 original articles, including 1014 biological studies. The types of organisms used as laboratory “model” organisms in fundamental homeopathic research include animal, human, plant, fungi and microbial organisms. Most animal studies (607) were with rats (209) or mice (171). Most plant studies (171) were with wheat (52). The database catalogues whether the experiment was performed on intact organisms or in organs or cells, isolated and analyzed for changes in structure, function and subcellular composition. The database might be especially useful to facilitate a search for experimental models that have been used in the study of both proving and therapeutic experiments—ultimately in the research on the homeopathic similia principle. www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex www.carstens-stiftung.de/hombrex "
"The HomBRex database of basic research experiments on homeopathy indexes studies on biological systems including animal, human, plant, fungi and microbial organisms. Its objective is to index proving and therapeutic experiments on the Similia Principle and the role of dilution and succussion of substances in experimental biologic systems. The database was analyzed when it contained more than 1100 experiments in more than 900 original articles. The database provides information on 732 experiments using healthy human, animal and plant systems. These experiments were divided into ‘ideal’ model proving (475) and prophylactic (257) categories. It also includes 397 therapeutic experiments, in which an effect of a substance was tested in a diseased or disturbed system. A large number of substances were used, including high and low dilutions and potencies—191 substances in proving, 130 in prophylactic and 112 in therapeutic experiments. In general, basic research in homeopathy does not directly investigate the Similia Principle. We conclude, that from the overwhelming variety in organisms, diseased states, and substances, only a limited number of biological systems and states should be selected to study the Similia Principle.

"Objective To set a standard of routine goal setting with patients within their package of care at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. We hope goal setting will improve communication with our patients and health professional colleagues, focus outcome and improve targeting of problems. We therefore explored motivation for and expectation of hospital attendance from a patient perspective. Materials and methods Questionnaire based pre-audit survey. The questionnaire was administered to 110 consecutive patients attending outpatients and 20 parents of children attending with asthma and eczema to gain understanding of motivation and expectation and more specific information for two of the commonest conditions. Results Seventy percent of patients had used some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), 35% had used homeopathy and only 10% had specialist homeopathic care, the majority of use being over the counter. The majority of patients had been encouraged by their General Practitioners, themselves and by word of mouth with family and friends. Few patients cited the media as a major influence. “Pull” factors such as “treating the whole person” were given greater emphasis except for parents of children with asthma and eczema for whom “push” factors such as fear of steroid side effects predominated. In the main patient expectations were reasonable with the majority hoping to see improvements in their conditions. A fifth of patients hoped to reduce conventional medications. Conclusions Patients had used CAM in general but not homeopathy in particular. Encouragement from doctors, self motivation and word of mouth most motivated patients to come and might suggest more direct communication with General Practitioners would be worthwhile. Being treated as a whole person was the most significant motivating factor, with a significant number of patients wishing to reduce medication. Goal setting and direct communication with other healthcare professionals is essential for safety, to focus outcome, and to value the role of homeopathy in a patient's healthcare. As a result we have set a standard whereby treatment goals are agreed with patients and communicated to referring health care professionals at each outpatient visit. This could be audited. "
"Objective To describe and compare characteristics of adult patients who received treatment for hypersensitivity illnesses by general practitioners (GPs) and classical homeopaths (CHs) over a period of 1 year and examine the statistical predictors of self-reported treatment outcomes. Material and methods We conducted a survey on 151 Danish adult patients with hypersensitivity illnesses, who chose treatment from one of 13 GPs or one of 10 CHs who participated in the project. The treatments were given as individual packages in the naturalistic clinical setting. Patients completed questionnaires at start of treatment, after 6 months and a year after start of treatment. Response rates for the first, second and third questionnaire were respectively 68%, 98%, 95% for the GP patients and 82%, 98%, 94% for the CH patients. Results Patients seeking CH treatment in this study are significantly different in gender and education from patients seeking GP treatment. We did not find significant differences in terms of occupational training, occupation, sickness absence due to hypersensitivity illnesses, diseases other than hypersensitivity illnesses, symptoms severity due to hypersensitivity illnesses before treatment and expectation of the ability of the treatment to alleviate symptoms. Eighty-eight percent of GP and 21% of CH patients were continuing treatment after 1 year. Regression analysis showed that the only significant independent variables to explain the probability of obtaining very positive effect or cure for GPs and CHs were that the patients were in ‘maintenance treatment’, and had high expectation before treatment of the ability of the treatment to relieve their symptoms. Conclusion In this study self-reported very positive effect of GP treatment and very positive effect and cure of CH treatment are associated with the patients’ high expectation of the treatment and continuation of maintenance treatment.

"In the last decade, we have investigated from the physicochemical point of view, whether water prepared by the procedures of homeopathic medicine (leading inexorably to systems without any molecule different from the solvent) results in water different from the initial water? The answer, unexpectedly, but strongly supported by many experimental results is positive. We used well-established physicochemical techniques: flux calorimetry, conductometry, pHmetry and galvanic cell electrodes potential. Unexpectedly the physicochemical parameters evolve in time. The water solvent exhibits large changes in measurable physicochemical properties as a function of its history, the solute previously dissolved, and time. In particular we found evidence of two new phenomena, both totally unpredicted, in homeopathic dilutions: the presence of a maximum in the measured physicochemical parameters vs sample age, and their dependence on the volume in which the dilution is stored. These new experimental results strongly suggest the presence of an extended and ‘ordered’ dynamics involving liquid water molecules. vs vs "

"‘Homeopathic dilutions’ and ‘Memory of Water’ are two expressions capable of turning a peaceful and intelligent person into a violently irrational one,’ as Michel Schiff points out in the introduction of his book ‘The Memory of Water’. The idea of the memory of water arose in the laboratory of Jacques Benveniste in the late 1980s and 20 years later the debate is still ongoing even though an increasing number of scientists report they have confirmed the basic results. This paper, first provides a brief historical overview of the context of the high dilution experiments then moves on to digital biology. One working hypothesis was that molecules can communicate with each other, exchanging information without being in physical contact and that at least some biological functions can be mimicked by certain energetic modes characteristics of a given molecule. These considerations informed exploratory research which led to the speculation that biological signaling might be transmissible by electromagnetic means. Around 1991, the transfer of specific molecular signals to sensitive biological systems was achieved using an amplifier and electromagnetic coils. In 1995, a more sophisticated procedure was established to record, digitize and replay these signals using a multimedia computer. From a physical and chemical perspective, these experiments pose a riddle, since it is not clear what mechanism can sustain such ‘water memory’ of the exposure to molecular signals. From a biological perspective, the puzzle is what nature of imprinted effect (water structure) can impact biological function. Also, the far-reaching implications of these observations require numerous and repeated experimental tests to rule out overlooked artifacts. Perhaps more important is to have the experiments repeated by other groups and with other models to explore the generality of the effect. In conclusion, we will present some of this emerging independent experimental work. "
"Homeopathic medicines are currently used in medical practice, despite controversy about their effectiveness. The preparation method is based on extremely high dilutions of many substances in water, far beyond any detectable level. For this reason, it has been suggested that water could retain a ‘memory’ of substances that have been dissolved in it before the successive dilutions. The paper stresses the fact that this idea is not compatible with our knowledge of pure water. If an explanation on physical grounds is to be found, research must focus in other aspects of the preparation, such as the presence of other molecules and dissolved gases. "
"Low-temperature thermoluminescence has been used in attempt to understand the particular structure of ultra high dilutions. Samples are activated by irradiation after freezing at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77°K). Experimental results show that, in the course of rewarming, the thermoluminescent glow is susbtantially different between dilutions of different substances. It is suggested that the dispersed gas phase might play a role in this process. "
"The ‘silica hypothesis’ is one of several frameworks that have been put forward to explain how homeopathic remedies, which often are diluted beyond the point where any of the original substance remains, might still be clinically effective. We describe here what the silica hypothesis says. From a physical chemistry viewpoint, we explore three challenges that the hypothesis would have to meet in order to explain homeopathy: thermodynamic stability of a large number of distinct structures, pattern initiation at low potencies, and pattern maintenance or gradual evolution at higher potencies. We juxtapose current knowledge about silicates with some of the conventional wisdom about homeopathic remedies, to see how well the latter might be a consequence of the former. We explore variants of the hypothesis including some speculations about mechanisms. We outline laboratory experiments that could help to decide it. "
"This paper discusses the nature of the active ingredient of homeopathic ultramolecular dilutions in terms of quantitative physics. First, the problem of the nature of an active ingredient in ultramolecular dilutions is analysed leading to the recognition of the necessity of characterizing the active ingredient as a non-local quality. Second, non-locality in quantum mechanics, which is used as a paradigm, is formally presented. Third, a generalization of quantum mechanics is considered, focussing on the consequences of weakening of the axioms. The formal treatment leads to the possible extension of the validity of quantum theory to macroscopic or even non-physical systems under certain circumstances with a while maintaining non-local behaviour. With respect to the survival of entanglement in such non-quantum systems a strong relationship between homeopathy and non-local behaviour can be envisaged. I describe how several authors apply this relationship. In conclusion, the paper reviews how quantum mechanics is closely related to information theory but why weak quantum theory and homeopathy have not hitherto been related in the same way. "
"The ‘memory of water’ is a concept by which the properties of an aqueous preparation are held to depend on the previous history of the sample. Although associated with the mechanism of homeopathy, this association may mislead. There is strong evidence concerning many ways in which the mechanism of this ‘memory’ may come about. There are also mechanisms by which such solutions may possess effects on biological systems which substantially differ from plain water. This paper examines the evidence. "
"The key stumbling block to serious consideration of homeopathy is the presumed “implausibility” of biological activity for homeopathic medicines in which the source material is diluted past Avogadro's number of molecules. Such an argument relies heavily on the assumptions of elementary chemistry (and biochemistry), in which the material composition of a solution, (dilution factors and ligand–receptor interactions), is the essential consideration. In contrast, materials science focuses on the three-dimensional complex network structure of the condensed phase of water itself, rather than the original solute molecules. The nanoheterogenous structure of water can be determined by interactive phenomena such as epitaxy (the transmission of structural information from the surface of one material to another without the transfer of any matter), temperature–pressure processes during succussion, and formation of colloidal nanobubbles containing gaseous inclusions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and possibly the remedy source material. Preliminary data obtained using Raman and Ultra-Violet–Visible (UV–VIS) spectroscopy illustrate the ability to distinguish two different homeopathic medicines (Nux vomica and Natrum muriaticum) from one another and to differentiate, within a given medicine, the 6c, 12c, and 30c potencies. Materials science concepts and experimental tools offer a new approach to contemporary science, for making significant advances in the basic science studies of homeopathic medicines.

"In order to fully comprehend its therapeutic mode of action, homeopathy might require both ‘local’ bio-molecular mechanisms, such as memory of water and ‘non-local’ macro-entanglement, such as patient–practitioner–remedy (PPR) descriptions. "
"Phenomena of long-term ‘memory of water’ imply that aqueous systems possessing it remain for a long period after the initial perturbation in an out-of equilibrium state without a constant supply of energy from the environment. It is argued here that various initial perturbations initiate development of a set of chain reactions of active oxygen species in water. Energy, in particular high grade energy of electronic excitation, released in such reactions can support non-equilibrium state of an aqueous system. In principle, such reactions can continue indefinitely due to specific local structuring of water with even minute ‘impurities’ that are always present in it and by continuous supply of oxygen amounts due to water splitting. Specific properties of several real aqueous systems, in particular, homeopathic potencies in which such processes could proceed, are discussed. The role of coherent domains in water in maintenance of active oxygen reactions and in emergence of oscillatory modes in their course is considered. "
"We discovered a previously unknown phenomenon in liquid water, which develops over time when water is left to stand undisturbed, and which made precise gravimetric measurement impossible. We term this property autothixotropy (weak gel-like behaviour developing spontaneously over time) and propose a possible explanation. The results of quantitative measurements, performed by two different methods, are presented. We also report the newly discovered phenomenon of autothixotropy-hysteresis and describe the dependence of autothixotropy on the degree of molecular translative freedom. A very important conclusion is that the presence of very low concentration of salt ions, these phenomena do not occur in deionized water. Salt ions may be the determinative condition for the occurrence of the phenomena. "
"Several hypothesized explanations for homeopathy posit that remedies contain a concentration of discrete information-carrying units, such as water clusters, nano-bubbles, or silicates. For any such explanation to be sustainable, dilution must reduce and succussion must restore the concentration of these units. Succussion can be modeled by a logistic equation, which leads to mathematical relationships involving the maximum concentration, the average growth of information-carrying units rate per succussion stroke, the number of succussion strokes, and the dilution factor (x, c, or LM). When multiple species of information-carrying units are present, the fastest-growing species will eventually come to dominate, as the potency is increased. An analogy is explored between iterated cycles dilution and succussion, in making homeopathic remedies, and iterated cycles of reseeding and growth, in bacterial cultures. Drawing on this analogy, the active ingredients in low and medium potency remedies may be present at early dilutions but only gradually come to ‘dominate’, while high potencies may develop from the occurrence of low-probability but faster-growing ‘mutations.’ Conclusions from this model include: ‘x’ and ‘c’ potencies are best compared by the amount of dilution, not the amount of succussion; the minimum number of succussion strokes needed per cycle is proportional to the logarithm of the dilution factor; and a plausible interpretation of why potencies at approximately regular ratios are traditionally used (the octave potencies convention). "
"There is significant debate on the nature of the active therapeutic ingredient in homeopathic medicines and whether the effect of homeopathic medicines is exerted locally. This paper accepts that there is an active therapeutic ingredient in homeopathic medicines that acts pharmacologically in the body and proposes a possible receptor site. The vomeronasal organ (Jacobson's organ) is the receptor site for the detection of non-odorant molecules, eg pheromones, in reptiles, amphibians and mammals. The organ forms the main part of a chemoreceptor system known as the vomeronasal system. This paper proposes that it is this system that constitutes the receptor for homeopathic medicines in both animal and human subjects. "

"Objective To evaluate individualized classical homeopathy in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN) Method 15 patients with physician-confirmed trigeminal neuralgia were treated with homeopathy. Patients received individualized homeopathic medicines as oral liquid 30C once per month and were followed-up at the end of first, second, third and fourth month. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for the evaluation of pain intensity and descriptive criteria were used for evaluation of attack frequency. Result All 15 patients completed treatment. The results for both the reduction of pain intensity and attack frequency were statistically significant (P<0.001) during the four-month evaluation. We observed overall reductions of more than 60% in pain intensity using homeopathic treatment. P P Conclusion The results suggest that homeopathic treatment is an effective and safe method in the treatment of ITN. "
"We illustrate the ‘vital sensation’ of mineral-based homeopathic medicines as revealed by an interview style based on a synthesis of the Bombay method and Scholten's, understanding derived from the periodic table. The ‘Bombay method’, described by Rajan Sankaran, builds on homeopathic teaching giving a structure to guide the gathering and synthesising homeopathic data. The concept of ‘levels’ gives a route to the deepest reflection of the vital disturbance, the vital sensation. Moving through the levels of fact, symptom, emotion, delusion and finally vital sensation provides valuable prescribing information. These aspects are discussed in conjunction with the kingdoms: plant, mineral and animal, focusing on the mineral kingdom. By synthesizing information relating to the concepts of vital sensation and kingdom we can reduce uncertainly in homeopathic prescribing. "
"Homeopathic Crotalus horridus 200C was evaluated in 13 clinical cases of babesiosis in dogs, compared with another 20 clinical cases treated with diminazine. Babesiosis is an important tropical tick-borne haemoprotozoan disease in dogs clinically manifested by anorexia, dehydration, temperature, dullness/depression, diarrhoea/constipation, pale mucosa, hepatomegaly, vomiting/nausea, splenomegaly, distended abdomen/ascites, yellow coloured urine, emaciation/weight loss, and occular discharge. The diagnosis of babesiosis was based on cytological evidence of Babesia gibsoni in freshly prepared blood smears. The dogs were treated with oral C. horridus 200C, 4 pills four times daily for 14 days (n=13) or diminazine aceturate 5 mg/kg single intramuscularly dose (n=20).

Homeopathy has a communication problem: important homeopathic concepts are not understood by conventional colleagues. Homeopathic terminology seems to be comprehensible only after practical experience of homeopathy. The main problem lies in different handling of diagnosis. In conventional medicine diagnosis is the starting point for randomised controlled trials to determine the effect of treatment. In homeopathy diagnosis is combined with other symptoms and personal traits of the patient to guide treatment and predict response. Broadening our scope to include diagnostic as well as treatment research opens the possibility of multi factorial reasoning. Adopting Bayesian methodology opens the possibility of investigating homeopathy in everyday practice and of describing some aspects of homeopathy in conventional terms.

"Background and Aims: A base for targeted research development in dental homeopathy can be founded on systematic collection and analysis of relevant data obtained by dentists in clinical practice. With these longer-term aims in mind, we conducted a pilot data collection study, in which 14 homeopathic dentists collected clinical and outcome data over a 6-month period in their practice setting. Background and Aims Methods: A specifically designed Excel spreadsheet enabled recording of consecutive dental appointments under the following main headings: date; patient identity (anonymised), age and gender; dental condition/complaint treated; whether chronic or acute, new or follow-up case; patient-assessed outcome (7-point Likert scale: −3 to +3) compared with first appointment; homeopathic medicine/s prescribed; whether any other medication/s being taken for the condition. Spreadsheets were submitted monthly via e-mail to the project co-ordinator for data synthesis and analysis. Methods Excel Results: Practitioners typically submitted data regularly and punctually, and most data cells were completed as required, enabling substantial data analysis. The mean age of patients was 46.2 years. A total of 726 individual patient conditions were treated overall. There was opportunity to follow-up 496 individual cases (positive outcome in 90.1%; negative in 1.8%; no change in 7.9%; outcome not recorded in 0.2%). Sixty-four of these 496 patients reported their outcome assessment before the end of the homeopathic appointment. Strongly positive outcomes (scores of +2 or +3) were achieved most notably in the frequently treated conditions of pericoronitis, periodontal abscess, periodontal infection, reversible pulpitis, sensitive cementum, and toothache with decay. Results Conclusions: This multi-practitioner pilot study has indicated that systematic recording of practice data in dental homeopathy is both feasible and capable of informing future research. A refined version of the spreadsheet can be employed in larger-scale research-targeted data collection in the dental practice setting.

"A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of a homeopathic combination medication for dengue fever was carried out in municipal health clinics in Honduras. Sixty patients who met the case definition of dengue (fever plus two ancillary symptoms) were randomized to receive the homeopathic medication or placebo for 1 week, along with standard conventional analgesic treatment for dengue. The results showed no difference in outcomes between the two groups, including the number of days of fever and pain as well as analgesic use and complication rates. Only three subjects had laboratory confirmed dengue. An interesting sinusoidal curve in reported pain scores was seen in the verum group that might suggest a homeopathic aggravation or a proving. The small sample size makes conclusions difficult, but the results of this study do not suggest that this combination homeopathic remedy is effective for the symptoms that are characteristic of dengue fever.

"Background and aims Targeted research development in veterinary homeopathy is properly informed by the systematic collection and analysis of relevant clinical data obtained by its practitioners. We organised a pilot data collection study, in which 8 Faculty of Homeopathy veterinarians collected practice-based clinical and outcomes data over a 6-month period. Methods A specifically designed Excel spreadsheet enabled recording of consecutive clinical appointments under the following headings: date; identity of patient and owner (anonymised); age, sex and species of patient; medical condition/complaint treated; whether confirmed diagnosis, chronic or acute, new or follow-up case; owner-assessed outcome (7-point Likert scale: −3 to +3) compared with first appointment; homeopathic medicine/s prescribed; other medication/s for the condition/complaint. Spreadsheets were submitted monthly by e-mail to the project organisers for data checking, synthesis and analysis. Excel ; − Excel ; − Results Practitioners submitted data regularly and punctually, and most data cells were completed. 767 individual patients were treated (547 dogs, 155 cats, 50 horses, 5 rabbits, 4 guinea-pigs, 2 birds, 2 goats, 1 cow, and 1 tortoise). Outcome from two or more homeopathic appointments per patient condition was obtained in 539 cases (79.8% showing improvement, 6.1% deterioration, 11.7% no change; outcome not recorded in 2.4% of follow-ups). Strongly positive outcomes (scores of +2 or +3) were achieved in: arthritis and epilepsy in dogs and, in smaller numbers, in atopic dermatitis, gingivitis and hyperthyroidism in cats. Conclusions Systematic recording of data by veterinarians in clinical practice is feasible and capable of informing future research in veterinary homeopathy. A refined version of the spreadsheet can be used in larger-scale research-targeted veterinary data collection. "
"Background Treatment of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with homeopathy is difficult. The Swiss randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over trial in ADHD patients (Swiss ADHD trial) was designed with an open-label screening phase prior to the randomised controlled phase. During the screening phase, the response of each child to successive homeopathic medications was observed until the optimal medication was identified. Only children who reached a predefined level of improvement participated in the randomised, cross-over phase. Although the randomised phase revealed a significant beneficial effect of homeopathy, the cross-over caused a strong carryover effect diminishing the apparent difference between placebo and verum treatment. Methods This retrospective analysis explores the screening phase data with respect to the risk of failure to demonstrate a specific effect of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with randomisation at the start of the treatment. Results During the screening phase, 84% (70/83) of the children responded to treatment and reached eligibility for the randomised trial after a median time of 5 months (range 1–18), with a median of 3 different medications (range 1–9). Thirteen children (16%) did not reach eligibility. Five months after treatment start, the difference in Conners Global Index (CGI) rating between responders and non-responders became highly significant (p=0.0006). Improvement in CGI was much greater following the identification of the optimal medication than in the preceding suboptimal treatment period (p<0.0001). p=0.0006 p p p=0.0006 p p p Conclusions Because of the necessity of identifying an optimal medication before response to treatment can be expected, randomisation at the start of treatment in an RCT of homeopathy in ADHD children has a high risk of failure to demonstrate a specific treatment effect, if the observation time is shorter than 12 months.

"Treatments for infertility in bulls are not described in homeopathic literature. A few treatments, such as changing the protein content of the diet, giving extra minerals, etc have been proposed. This case report describes homeopathic treatment for infertility in a prize bull. A Nelore bull, considered infertile for 3 years, was treated with homeopathic Pulsatilla nigricans 200 CH. Decreased total sperm defects, increased sperm motility and a very impressive increased number of doses of semen produced were observed. The bull relapsed after treatment was withdrawn, but again responded when it was resumed. Since only one animal was observed one cannot assume that the observed changes were due only to this treatment. Further studies may establish the real benefits of a homeopathic medicine in bull infertility. Pulsatilla nigricans Pulsatilla nigricans "
"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Homeopathic Arnica in reducing the morbidity following tonsillectomy Objective Arnica Methods: Randomised double blind, placebo controlled trial at a tertiary referral centre. 190 patients over the age of 18 undergoing tonsillectomy were randomised into intervention and control groups receiving either Arnica 30c or identical placebo, 2 tablets 6 times in the first post-operative day and then 2 tablets twice a day for the next 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the change in pain scores (visual analogue scale) recorded by the patient on a questionnaire over 14 days post-operatively; Secondary outcome measures were: analgesia consumption, visits to the GP or hospital, antibiotic usage, the day on which their swallowing returned to normal and the day on which they returned to work. Methods Arnica Results: 111 (58.4%) completed questionnaires were available for analysis. The Arnica group had a significantly larger drop in pain score from day 1 to day 14 (28.3) compared to the placebo group (23.8) with p<0.05. The two groups did not differ significantly on analgesic consumption or any of the other secondary outcome measures (number of post-operative visits to GP, use of antibiotics and secondary haemorrhage readmissions).

"When homeopathy is tested in clinical trials, understanding and appraisal is likely to be improved if published reports contain details of prescribing strategies and treatments. An international Delphi panel was convened to develop consensus guidelines for reporting homeopathic methods and treatments. The panel agreed 28 treatment- and provider-specific items that supplement the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement items 2, 3, 4 and 19. The authors recommend these for adoption by authors and journals when reporting trials of homeopathy. "
"Background The quality of information gathered from homeopathic pathogenetic trials (HPTs), also known as ‘provings’, is fundamental to homeopathy. We systematically reviewed HPTs published in six languages (English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Dutch) from 1945 to 1995, to assess their quality in terms of the validity of the information they provide. Methods The literature was comprehensively searched, only published reports of HPTs were included. Information was extracted by two reviewers per trial using a form with 87 items. Information on: medicines, volunteers, ethical aspects, blinding, randomization, use of placebo, adverse effects, assessments, presentation of data and number of claimed findings were recorded. Methodological quality was assessed by an index including indicators of internal and external validity, personal judgement and comments of reviewers for each study. Results 156 HPTs on 143 medicines, involving 2815 volunteers, produced 20,538 pathogenetic effects (median 6.5 per volunteer). There was wide variation in methods and results. Sample size (median 15, range 1–103) and trial duration (mean 34 days) were very variable. Most studies had design flaws, particularly absence of proper randomization, blinding, placebo control and criteria for analysis of outcomes. Mean methodological score was 5.6 (range 4–16). More symptoms were reported from HPTs of poor quality than from better ones. In 56% of trials volunteers took placebo. Pathogenetic effects were claimed in 98% of publications. On average about 84% of volunteers receiving active treatment developed symptoms. The quality of reports was in general poor, and much important information was not available. Conclusions The HPTs were generally of low methodological quality. There is a high incidence of pathogenetic effects in publications and volunteers but this could be attributable to design flaws. Homeopathic medicines, tested in HPTs, appear safe. The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports. Improvement of the method and reporting of results of HPTs are required.

"Epilepsy is an important neurological disorder in dogs. Belladonna 200C was evaluated in 10 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. During the seizure phase, 3–4 drops of Belladonna 200C were administered orally at 15 min intervals until considerable reduction in seizure activity, then four times daily. Four dogs with head shaking syndrome in addition to seizures were given Cocculus 6C, 3–4 drops orally weekly for 3 months in addition. Numbers of fits reduced to 2–3 during first 2 weeks post-therapy and then became occasional in next 2 weeks. With continuation of Belladonna therapy, no fits were observed during 2–7 months follow-up. In two cases epileptic fits reappeared within 15–25 days of cessation of therapy. Belladonna therapy was resumed and seizure control was again achieved. Owners were advised to continue the therapy at least twice daily until there were no fits for 2–3 months. Liver specific enzymes were monitored, no abnormalities were observed. Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna Belladonna "
"Background and aims A base for targeted research and development in homeopathy can be founded on systematic collection and analysis of relevant clinical data obtained by doctors in routine practice. With these longer-term aims in mind, we conducted a pilot data collection study, in which 14 homeopathic physicians collected clinical and outcomes data over a 6-month period in their practice setting. Methods A specifically designed Excel spreadsheet enabled recording of consecutive clinical appointments under the following main headings: date, patient identity (anonymised), age and gender, medical condition/complaint treated, whether chronic or acute, new or follow-up case, patient-assessed outcome (7-point Likert scale: −3 to +3) compared with first appointment, homeopathic medicine/s prescribed, whether any other medication/s being taken for the condition. Spreadsheets were submitted monthly via email to the project co-ordinator for data synthesis and analysis. Excel Excel Results Practitioners typically submitted data regularly and punctually, and most data cells were completed as required, enabling substantial data analysis. The mean age of patients was 41.5 years. A total of 1783 individual patient conditions were treated overall. Outcome from two or more homeopathic appointments per patient condition was obtained in 961 cases (75.9% positive, 4.6% negative, 14.7% no change; 4.8% outcome not recorded). Strongly positive outcomes (scores of +2 or +3) were achieved most notably in the frequently treated conditions of anxiety, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome. Conclusions This multi-practitioner pilot study has indicated that systematic recording of clinical data in homeopathy is both feasible and capable of informing future research. A refined version of the spreadsheet can be employed in larger-scale research-targeted clinical data collection in the medical practice setting—particularly in primary care. "
"The Homeopathic Clinic of the Campo di Marte Hospital, Lucca, Italy (the Homeopathic Reference Centre for Tuscany) registered a total of 1287 patients seen for the first time between September 1998 and 31 December 2004, of these 560 (43.5%) returned for a follow-up visit after a minimum interval of 2 months following the first consultation. In order to ascertain the reasons for patients not returning for follow-up consultations (drop-out) a telephone survey was carried out on every patient who had been seen during the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003, but had not returned for a follow-up visit. 73/104 eligible patients were contacted. 37/73 referred to the effectiveness of the treatment which led to an improvement in their state of health, naming this as the reason why they did not return for a follow-up visit.

"Malaria is one of the most important parasitic diseases in the world and a major public health problem because of emerging drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium. A number of synthetic and natural compounds are now being analysed to develop more effective antimalarial drugs. We investigated the effect of homeopathic preparations of Eupatorium perfoliatum and Arsenicum album on parasitemia using a rodent malaria model. Plasmodium Eupatorium perfoliatum Arsenicum album We found significant inhibitory effect on parasite multiplication with both medications with a level of 60% for Eupatorium perfoliatum at a 30 CH potency. Arsenicum album 0/6 gave 70% inhibition but this was less stable than Eupatorium perfoliatum. The number of schizonts was higher in animals treated with homeopathic medications. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, these agents would be good candidates as alternative or complementary medications in the treatment of malaria.

"Objective To determine the feasibility, in terms of acceptability to patients, physicians and other staff; data return and statistical power of a study to elucidate the relative contributions of specific and non-specific effects in homeopathic treatment of dermatitis. Design Randomised, controlled 4-arm trial, 2 arms double-blind. Setting Outpatient clinic, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital. Participants Seventy-five adult patients with dermatitis. Interventions Patients were randomly allocated to: ‘fast track’ open verum homeopathy, ‘fast track’ double-blind verum homeopathy, ‘fast track’ double-blind placebo homeopathy or waiting list control. Main outcome measures One hundred millimeter visual analogue scale of overall symptom severity; 10 point digital scores of sleep, itching, skin condition; weekly 5-point Likert scale of topical steroid use; Dermatology Life Quality Index at entry and completion. Results Recruitment was below target, but the study was acceptable to staff and feasible. Blinded patients were more likely to withdraw (P=0.021, χ2 test). After correction for baseline differences and multiple comparisons, no outcome measure showed statistically significant between group differences. Blindness appeared to have a negative effect, but this was confounded by differential withdrawal. P 2 P 2 Conclusions A definitive trial of this design is unlikely to discriminate the relative contributions of the non-specific and specific effects to the outcome of homeopathic treatment of dermatitis, because of patient preference issues.

"Samuel Hahnemann attributed fundamental importance to the principle of similitude, promoting it to a ‘natural law’. Observing that enantiopathic or allopathic treatment produced enduring aggravation of the disease symptoms after a brief and transitory initial relief, he systematised homeopathic treatment, prescribing substances that provoke similar symptoms in healthy individual. Based on clinical and experimental observations, he anticipated the concept of homeostasis, dividing the effects of substances into: primary action of the medicine followed by secondary action or reaction of the organism. This reaction, known as the rebound effect or paradoxical action by modern pharmacology, used to awake the curative response of the body when the principle of similitude is applied, is responsible for several iatrogenic diseases when used on the basis of the principle of contraries. This study discusses the role of this paradoxical reaction of the organism in the fatal side effects of four important drugs, used according to the model of enantiopathic treatment of the symptoms. I present evidence relating to acetylsalicylic acid, rofecoxib, antidepressants and long-acting bronchodilators. The consequences of the allopathic treatment could be decreased if health professionals valued homeostasis, minimising the rebound effect of the organism by gradual suspension of palliative drugs. "
"The therapeutic and pathogenetic effects of Dolichos pruriens were evaluated using experimental models in rats. In the therapeutic experiment Wistar rats were housed in a heated environment (25±3°C) to induce itch, and treated with ascending potencies D. pruriens (6 cH, 9 cH, 12 cH and 30 cH), each for 10 days. The positive control group received vehicle (ethanol 30% in water). The negative control group received no treatment and were kept at a standard temperature. Dolichos pruriens D. pruriens In the pathogenetic experiment, all animals were kept at a temperature of 20±3 °C and treated for 30 consecutive days with D. pruriens 6 or 30 cH, or ethanol vehicle, or no treatment. The experiments were performed blind. D. pruriens The statistical analysis used Bartlett's test, followed by ANOVA/Tuckey–Krammer or Kruskal–Wallis/Dunn. The results point to the existence of therapeutic effects, with inhibition of the itching, skin lesions and fur thinning produced by heat, more evident in later observations, with the 9 12, and 30 cH potencies (Kruskal–Wallis/Dunn; P=0.001). No changes were observed in the other parameters, such as open field activity and laterality of the itching. In the pathogenetic experiment, no changes were observed in any parameters examined. We conclude that the proposed experimental model demonstrates the therapeutic effect of D. pruriens, but not its pathogenetic effects.

"Objective To conduct a systematic review of the clinical research evidence on homeopathy in the treatment of anxiety and anxiety disorders. Methods A comprehensive search of major biomedical databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClNAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library; and of specialist complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) databases: AMED, CISCOM and Hom-Inform was conducted. Efforts were made to identify unpublished and ongoing research using relevant sources and experts in the field. Relevant research was categorised by study type and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for studies reporting clinical outcomes. Results Eight randomised controlled studies were identified. The types of anxiety and anxiety disorders studied were test anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder and anxiety related to medical or physical conditions such as cancer or surgical procedures. Single case reports/studies were the most frequently encountered study type but other study types including uncontrolled trials/case series and surveys were also found. No relevant qualitative research was identified. Conclusions A comprehensive search demonstrates that the evidence on the benefit of homeopathy in anxiety and anxiety disorders is limited. A number of studies of homeopathy in such conditions were located but the randomised controlled trials report contradictory results, are underpowered or provide insufficient details of methodology. Several uncontrolled and observational studies reported positive results including high levels of patient satisfaction but because of the lack of a control group, it is difficult to assess the extent to which any response is due to homeopathy. Adverse effects reported appear limited to ‘remedy reactions’ and included temporary worsening of symptoms and reappearance of old symptoms. On the basis of this review it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy or effectiveness of homeopathy for anxiety. However, surveys suggest that homeopathy is quite frequently used by people suffering from anxiety. If shown to be effective, it is possible that homeopathy may have benefits in terms of adverse effects and acceptability to patients. Consequently, further investigation is indicated. Future research should be of pragmatic design and include qualitative studies. "

"Background The rigorous test to which homeopathy was subject in our recent double-blind clinical trail of homeopathic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) necessitated optimized treatment meeting the highest standards. Methods Optimization was performed in three steps: (1) In successfully treated children, prescriptions leading to an insufficient response were analysed by a general questionnaire to identify unreliable symptoms. (2) Polarity analysis, a further development of Bönninghausen's concept of contraindications, was introduced in response to the frequently one-sided symptoms. This enabled us to use few but specific symptoms to identify the medicine whose genius symptoms exhibit the closest match to the patient's characteristic symptoms. (3) We investigated the influence of the primary perception symptoms on the result of the repertorization. Perception symptoms are not normally recorded during a patient interview even though they are among the most reliable facts related by the patients. At the same time we were able to improve the continuity of improvement of ADHD symptoms using liquid Q-potencies. Results Introducing the questionnaire, polarity analysis, and including perception symptoms, lead to an improvement in the success rate of the first prescription from 21% to 54%, of the fifth prescription from 68% to 84%.

"This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a homeopathic complex in the management of true anoestrus in crossbred cows. Six anoestrus cows were treated with a homeopathic complex (Calcarea phosphorica 30c, Aletris farinosa 30c, Pulsatilla 30c, Aurum muriaticum natronatum 30c, Sepia 30c and Phosphorus 30c in equal proportion, 15 pills twice daily orally for 10 days). Six animals acted as control without any treatment. Calcarea phosphorica 30c, Aletris farinosa 30c, Pulsatilla 30c, Aurum muriaticum natronatum 30c, Sepia 30c and Phosphorus 30c Treatment was 100% effective in inducing oestrus in anoestrus cows with mean interval of 27.5±5.3 days. All animals conceived and overall conception rate was 54.5% with 1.83 services per conception. In the homeopathic complex treated group, increased serum oestradiol concentration (20.88±5.60 to 27.80±7.28 pg/ml) was observed compared to the pretreatment (11.71±2.06 pg/ml) and control value (10.43±1.77 to 13.94±3.14 pg/ml). The homeopathic complex medicine may be effective and economical in the treatment of true anoestrus condition in cows.

"Lady's finger plants (Hibiscus esculentus), grown in pots, were inoculated with the second-stage larvae (76±6) of root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita, starting 7 days later they were treated with Cina 30c, Santonin 30c or Ethanol 30c by foliar spray for 10 consecutive days. The drugs in 90% ethanol were diluted with distilled water 1:1000 before application on plants. Thirty days after the last treatment the plants were uprooted. Cina 30c and Santonin 30c reduced nematode infestation of plants significantly in terms of root-gall number, root-protein content and nematode population in roots. Santonin 30c reduced root water content. Santonin 30c may have influenced the water channel proteins of root tissues thereby altering the water contents of roots. The reduced water content in roots might have adversely affected the root-knot nematodes and thus reduced nematode infestation. Ethanol 30c also has some effect on treated plants.

"Background Homeopathic pathogenetic trials (provings) are fundamental to homeopathy. Since most of the data from available provings have not been statistically evaluated, it is unclear how specific reported symptoms are and how they differ from those reported by people taking placebo. Method We combine and analyse data from two different homeopathic pathogenic trials—including 10 and 11 provers, respectively, and both including 30% placebo—to test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the number of symptoms in placebo and verum groups. Results The principal results were: •Placebo reported less symptoms than verum groups.•Symptom distribution according to predefined classes (common symptoms increased in intensity and/or duration-, cured, old, new and exceptional) was statistically different between placebo and verum group at a high level of significance (P<0.001).

"Background Salmonellosis is a common problem worldwide in commercially reared poultry. It is associated with human Salmonellosis. No fully satisfactory method of control is available. Method Nosodes to an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in D30 (30X) potency were prepared. One day old chicks (N=180) were divided into four groups: two control and two different preparations of the nosode. Treatments were administered in drinking water for 10 days. The birds were challenged by a broth culture of the same Salmonella, by mouth, on day 17. Cloacal swabs were taken twice weekly for Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. Salmonella enterica N Salmonella Salmonella enterica Salmonella enterica N Salmonella Salmonella enterica Results Birds receiving active treatment were less likely to grow the strain of Salmonella from cloacal swabs compared to control. Salmonella Salmonella Conclusion Isopathy is low cost and non-toxic. It may have a role to play in the widespread problem of Salmonella in poultry. Further research should be conducted. "
"The objective of this study is to describe patients who had treatment for hypersensitivity illnesses by general practitioners (GPs) or classical homeopaths (CHs) and the patients’ self-reported effectiveness of the treatment received. The data stems from an exploratory retrospective study amongst 88 Danish patients (response rate 58%) suffering from hypersensitivity illnesses, who chose treatment from one of six GPs or one of 10 CHs who participated in the project. The patients themselves selected their treatment. The GPs or the CHs considered that the patient's treatment was complete or that the patient was in a situation of current ‘maintenance treatment’. The patients’ primary reason for consulting the GP or the CH was that they were suffering from hypersensitivity illnesses. No significant difference was found between the two groups of patients in relation to age, education and duration of hypersensitivity symptoms. The CH patients were more likely to be employed in teaching, research, health care or the social sector compared to GP patients. The two groups of patients were similar in respect of their health at the start of the treatment, 57% of the patients who consulted a CH experienced an improvement of their state of health compared to 24% of the GP patients. Both groups of patients experienced an improvement of their psychological health after treatment. Logistic regression analysis showed that the GP or CH was the only significant effect variable. The results are based on the patients’ retrospective, self-reported effectiveness of the treatments. "
"The use of homeopathy is increasing worldwide. This multi-centre cross-sectional study aims to describe the opinions and self-reported health status of a sample of Italian people seeking homeopathic care. A self-administered questionnaire including socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge and opinions about homeopathy, personal experience with homeopathy, and, self-reported health status (SF-12), was administered to a sample of people who had sought homeopathy. Of a possible 1229 individuals invited to participate, 1223 did so. The majority of the participants were female, young (mean age 42 years), well educated (mean 13 years of education). The reason for seeking care was for either physical or emotional conditions. Most participants had fair to good knowledge of homeopathy, and the self-experienced effect (subjective judgment on efficacy) was good regardless of the type of health condition reported. The Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) scores were similar to the general Italian population, but the Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) scores were lower in all relevant strata examined. This study provides information on the characteristics of people seeking homeopathic care, in particular the results of the SF-12 self-reported health status evaluation. "
An interim assessment of likelihood ratio of homeopathic symptoms shows that there are serious flaws in Kent's repertory. The system of expressing relationship between symptoms and expected results from medicines by typeface is unclear and unreliable. Bayesian methods can improve this and expand the possibilities of the repertory including the possibility of interpreting the absence of expected symptoms. 
"Root-knot disease of mulberry is caused by the nematode Meloidogyne incognita. It has important economic implications for sericulture. The homeopathic medicines, Cina mother tincture (MT) and potentised Cina 200C, prepared from the flowering meristems of Artemisia nilagirica (Clarke) Pamp, were applied by foliar spray on mulberry (Morus alba L.) infected with M. incognita juveniles(J2). Pretreatment (ending 6 days before inoculation) and post-treatment (starting 6 days after inoculation) schedules were tested. The two uninoculated control batches were treated with the same procedure with Cina MT and Cina 200C. Meloidogyne incognita. Cina Cina 200C, Artemisia nilagirica Morus alba M. incognita 2 Cina MT Cina 200C. Both pre- and post-treatment significantly reduced nematode infection in terms of root gall number and nematode population in root. All the treated plants showed improved growth in terms of fresh biomass of shoot and root, length of shoot and root, number of leaves, leaf surface area, root and leaf-protein content. Cina 200C is more effective than Cina MT in all respects of nematode control as well as growth of the test plants. Pretreatments show slightly better effects than the post-treatments. It is interesting that inoculated and treated plants not only are less affected by nematodes but also have a better growth than uninoculated, untreated control.

"Allergies, especially respiratory allergies, are one of the indications for which homeopathic treatment is most frequently sought. The progress of 147 cases of respiratory allergy since in private homeopathic practice is reported here. Only two cases of ear, nose and throat (ENT) allergies out of a total of 105 showed no improvement, no patients deteriorated. Two cases with worsening and three without improvement were noted out of 42 cases of pulmonary allergies. The constitutional homeopathic remedies varied, Lycopodium, Pulsatilla and Sulphur were most frequently prescribed for ENT allergies, there was no predominantly prescribed remedy in the pulmonary allergy group. Lycopodium Pulsatilla Sulphur Thirty one cases of respiratory allergies consulted only once. The reasons for such a state have been reviewed. If all these cases were therapeutic failures, the success rate of the homeopathic treatment is 87.6%. Lycopodium Pulsatilla Sulphur "
"Background Histamine is known to elicit a negative feedback effect on anti-IgE and allergen-induced basophil activation. A series of experiments performed between 1981 and 1995 using a manual method showed biological activity of highly diluted histamine. Most of the experiments used histermine in the range 10−30 (15C)–10−36 M (18C). These results were confirmed by automated flow cytometry, but this method is based on the selection of basophils by anti-IgE and analysis of basophil activation by anti-CD 63, showing significant but relatively low inhibition (approximately 14%), insufficient to convince the scientific community of the reality of the phenomenon. −30 −36 −30 −36 Objective We investigated if the use of CD 203c, a basophil specific, earlier marker than CD 63 of the activation cascade, increased the sensitivity of the method, testing two target histamine dilutions, 10−4 (2C) and 10−32 M (16C). −4 −32 −4 −32 Methods Basophils, obtained from buffy coats, were pre-incubated with the histamine dilutions and activated by two agonists: anti-IgE and fMLP (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide). Basophil activation was stopped with EDTA. The cells were labelled with anti-IgE, anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 14 for basophil selection, and anti-CD 63 and anti-CD 203c for basophil activation. Results were expressed in up-regulation percentage for CD 63 or mean intensity of fluorescence (MFI) for CD 203c. Results Histamine 10−4 M (2C) and histamine 10−32 M (16C) were capable of inhibiting both IgE-dependent (anti-IgE) and IgE-independent (fMLP) basophil activation. The percentage inhibition depended on the activation marker used. The highest inhibition for histamine dilution 16C was observed with CD 203c (38%, P<0.001), approximately half the inhibition observed with histamine 2C (73%). −4 −32 P −4 −32 P Conclusion These new flow cytometric protocols confirmed that high dilutions of histamine may inhibit basophil activation and that the inhibitory effect is not restricted to IgE-dependent activation. The use of CD 203c instead of CD 63 increased the magnitude of the response. "
"Eosinophilic granuloma complex (EGC) is a syndrome occurring in cats, characterized by lesions affecting the skin and the oral cavity. Conventional treatment is mainly symptomatic and may have undesirable side effects. This paper summarizes homeopathic treatment with snake remedies of cats suffering from EGC. Snake remedies were chosen by individual repertorizations and administered in different dilutions. Reactions were mostly quick, leading to significant improvements, including complete recoveries. "
"The international review board was set up as the scientific advisory body of the Swiss Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme (PEK) in 2002. It has met several times and has given advice with respect to the most important aspects of the programme. It would have been the normal procedure for the review board to have had the opportunity to comment on the drafts of the final scientific products as well as the draft of the summary report, in order to advise on them, before the documents became publicly available and formed the basis for political decision making. But the responsible authorities changed this process. In the following, the review board comments both on this process and on the products. "
This paper explores a relationship between poetry and homeopathy. It proposes we expand and enlighten our knowledge of the patient and develop our consultation through our experience of poetry. Within each consultation is a poem. Heightened awareness of this and many other aspects can improve the sensibilities of the practitioner and enhance deeper healing of the patient. We are challenged to respond. poetry consultation poem poetry consultation poem 
"The author describes his experience assisting mentally disabled patients with homeopathy. In these patients’ anamneses, common traits shared by some syndromes, pathologies and behaviour, were taken into consideration, mainly to choose the most characteristic symptoms in each case. The study includes 58 cases of patients suffering from this pathology: 28 females and 30 males, ages ranging from 1 to 49 years (mean 20). Forty-seven had some improvement. Homeopathy is a useful alternative to relieve pathologies associated with mental disability. In those cases in which there were similarities between remedy and whole symptomatology, improvements in adaptation skills and in overall health were observed. "
"Objective To assess homeopathic consultations in NHS general practice over a 12-month study period; to analyse the conditions treated homeopathically and assess the responses to homeopathy prescribed in a standard 10 min GP consultation. Methods Data on each homeopathic consultation over 12 months were recorded: including patient details; condition/diagnosis; response score; prescribed medicine; prescribing strategy; medical speciality category. Clinical response was scored using a modified version of the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital Outcome Scale. Results Over the 12-month study period, a total of 5331 consultations were conducted within the general practice; 489 (9%) of these consultations were homeopathic. A wide variety of conditions were treated homeopathically, 78% of patients had a positive clinical response, 19% no response, 3% negative response. Analysis of the prescribing strategies demonstrated that 73% of the homeopathic prescriptions were issued using the ‘problem-based’ strategy. The remainder were ‘patient-based’ (19%), ‘context-based’ (4%) and ‘combined’ (4%) strategies. Conclusions This study illustrates the varied and successful application of homeopathy within the general practice setting. Response scores reveal the beneficial effects of homeopathic treatment. This study supports the use of homeopathy within NHS general practice, delivered in a 10 min consultation. "
"Aim There are a few examining changes in patient groups seeking homeopathic care. This study describes changes in complaints and characteristics of patients visiting a homeopathic clinic in Norway from 1994/1995 to 2003/2004. Methods Two surveys were conducted, each including data for 700 patients who had visited the same homeopathic clinic, with five (1995) and seven (2004) homeopaths, respectively. Data on patients’ gender, age, occupation, reason for encounter and where they had heard about homeopathy and the homeopathic clinic were registered by the homeopaths. In 2004, the patients also answered questions on the previous use of conventional treatment and how long it took them to decide to consult a homeopath. Results There are no changes in the reason for encounter and gender proportions between 1995 and 2004. Over 36% of patients were under the age of 16 in 2004, compared to 26% in 1995. Most patients still consult homeopaths through a lay referral network. In 2004, more than 60% made an appointment with a homeopath within the first month of first considering it. Conclusion There are few changes in the characteristics of this homeopathic patient population. There is a need for studies that explore the ‘why question’; Why an increasing percentage of patients are children? Why people with higher education and why certain age groups visit homeopaths more frequently than others? "
"We investigated whether water has a ‘memory’ for succussion compared to unsuccussed controls. The method is based on a bioassay using dinoflagellates. The duration of memory measured by this method is at least 10 min, and may be longer. The effect may be based upon solitons. A hypothesis about the mode of action of homeopathy may be experimentally investigated by this method. "
"Background The assessment of harm arising from the use of homeopathic medicine is much discussed, but there is little published data on the subject. Aim To study prospectively adverse drug events related to homeopathic medicines. Setting The data were gathered between 1 June 2003 and 30 June 2004 during follow-up visits consecutively carried out at the Homeopathic Clinic, Campo di Marte Hospital, Azienda USL 2, Lucca (Italy). They refer to effects following the administration of a homeopathic medicine, prescribed according to the classical homeopathic method. Methods Reports collected by a homeopathic doctor (not the prescribing doctor) on the nature and intensity of the effect, dose and frequency of administration, time relationship between the drug use and the adverse events, challenge, unchallange possible concomitant factors, causality (improbable, unlikely, possible, probable, certain). Results Out of 335 homeopathic consecutive follow-up visits between 1 June 2003 and 30 June 2004, nine adverse reactions were reported (2.68%) including one case of allergy to lactose, excipient of the granules. Conclusions Adverse events to homeopathic drugs exist and are distinguishable from homeopathic aggravations, but are rare and not severe. "
"Mitochondrial activity is an important viability parameter of spermatozoa and is linked to sperm motility. Monensin is commonly used as an inhibitor for sperm mitochondrial activity in the laboratory. This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of some homeopathic dilutions of monensin on sperm mitochondrial activity. Fresh ejaculates from 6 mature bulls were used in the study. Samples of the semen were tested using a flow cytometer for mitochondrial activity and sperm viability using Rhodamine 123 and SYBR-14, respectively. The 9× dilution of monensin resulted in very highly significant (P<0.001) stimulation of mitochondrial activity. Monensin 5×, 7×, 8× and 13× caused highly significant (P<0.01) stimulation of the sperm mitochondrial activity. Other homeopathic dilutions of monensin (6×, 10×, 11×, 12× and 14×) also had a significant (P<0.05) stimulatory effect. The use of monensin did not have any negative effect on sperm viability. We conclude that some homeopathic dilutions of monensin increase mitochondrial activity of bovine spermatozoa without negative effect on sperm viability, the 9× dilution was the most effective. Further in vivo studies are required to estimate the effect of homeopathic dilutions of monensin on semen quality.

"This paper reports an audit of clinical outcome in 455 consecutive patients (1100 consultations) presenting for private homeopathic treatment of a chronic illness in which conventional treatment had either: failed, reached a plateau in effect, or was contra-indicated by side effects, age or condition of the patient. Three hundred and four patients (66.8%) derived benefit from homeopathic treatment. One hundred and forty-eight patients (32.5%) were able to stop or maintain a substantial reduction in their conventional drugs. The 10 most frequent clinical conditions treated were eczema, anxiety, depression, osteoarthritis, asthma, back pain, chronic cough, chronic fatigue, headaches and essential hypertension. These 195 patients constitute 43% of the total, 151 of them (77%) were improved. The success rate of treatment is similar between age ranges. There was a difference in outcome between the sexes in adults: 296 females treated, success rate 71.3%; 159 males treated, success rate 58.5%. Two patients (0.4%) had prolonged aggravation of their presenting complaints apparently attributable to homeopathic treatment. "
"The sixth edition of Samuel Hahnemann's Organon of Medicine is an obligatory work of reference for homeopathy. Nevertheless, its philosophy can be questioned with constructivistic and historistic objections. Three levels of content may be distinguished: (1) practical directions and maxims, (2) theoretical explanations and hypotheses, (3) conceptual foundations and premises. Ideally, these levels should be considered, studied, and taught separately and gradually. My new German edition of the Organon, published in 2003, tries to meet these demands. It contains: (A) a complete version of Hahnemann's original text, in the original order of paragraphs, but in modern German with section headings, summary boxes, etc added, etc (B) another full version of its content, organized in three levels, as indicated above, (C) a glossary of about 400 problematic terms. etc "
"Depression is common in general practice and lack of concordance is an important problem in its treatment. Homeopathy has few side effects and is generally associated with good compliance. We report a study investigating the feasibility of a trial to compare the effectiveness of homeopathy with a conventional antidepressant and placebo. Objectives To assess the feasibility of a general practice-based clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of individualised homeopathic treatment vs Fluoxetine (Prozac) vs placebo in the treatment of major depressive episodes of moderate severity. Design Randomised, double-dummy, double-blind parallel group clinical trial. Setting Lower Clapton Group Practice, East London. Method Patients were recruited through their general practitioners as they presented during a 9 month period. Recruitment target was 30 patients. Eligibility was confirmed by a consultant psychiatrist using standard criteria (DSM-IV) and instruments Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Suicidal and psychotic patients were excluded, additional precautions against suicide were incorporated. There was a 1 week run-in period and patients showing spontaneous improvement were excluded. Homeopathic treatment was prescribed by a GP qualified in homeopathy, from a ‘limited list’ of 30 homeopathic medicines, with the help of decision support software. Patients were randomised to receive verum Fluoxetine and placebo homeopathy, or verum homeopathy and placebo Fluoxetine, or placebo homeopathy and placebo Fluoxetine. Treatment duration was 12 weeks. The outcomes were: adverse drug reactions, clinical global impression (CGI); HAMD; mini international psychiatric Interview; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Side-effects checklist; Short Form 12; treatment credibility questionnaire; work and social disability scale. The primary outcome measures were HAMD and CGI. Results A recruitment calculation indicated that over 230 suitable patients would be expected to attend the practice during the recruitment phase. Thirty one patients were referred for possible inclusion in the trial by their GPs. Twenty three met the entry criteria, 11 were randomised and 6 completed the study. Of the completers, one received homeopathy, 2 placebo and 3 Fluoxetine. Conclusions A trial of this design in general practice is not feasible, because of recruitment difficulties, many of them linked to patient preference. Different approaches are required to recruit adequate patient numbers to trials of this sort. "

"Objective To study the reliability of a proving methodology and the reproducibility of proving symptoms. Methods Two homeopathic medicines and placebo were given, in a double-blind randomized design, to 31 healthy volunteers (13 Piper methysticum 30C, 11 placebo and 7 Plumbum metallicum 30C), 5 drops 4 times daily, until the onset of unbearable symptoms, or at most for 1 week. The primary outcome measure was the number of phrases containing unusual or new symptoms selected by supervisors (SEL) from unstructured diaries and the number of these symptoms (SYM) present in SELs. The secondary outcome measures were the number of symptoms with modalities of both verum groups concordant with symptoms reported in a previous proving of Plumbum 12C. Other parameters evaluated were repeated and crossed symptoms in SELs. Piper methysticum Plumbum metallicum Plumbum Piper methysticum Plumbum metallicum Plumbum Results Both medicines showed qualitative and quantitative differences from placebo. Piper: 146 SELs (median: 5), Plumbum: 118 SELs (16), placebo: 48 SELs (2), containing 260 (8), 199 (29) and 58 (2) SYMs, respectively. There was a significant difference from placebo in Plumbum but not in Piper SELs and SYMs (P<0.05). 31, 24 and 4 ‘repeated’ and 18, 22 and 2 ‘crossed’ symptoms were found in Piper, Plumbum and placebo. 8 and 30 symptoms concordant with the classical proving of Plumbum were found for Piper and Plumbum, corresponding to about 10% and 45% of their total SELs. Piper Plumbum: Plumbum Piper P Piper Plumbum Plumbum Piper Plumbum Piper Plumbum: Plumbum Piper P Piper Plumbum Plumbum Piper Plumbum Conclusions Open diaries, supervision and double-blind placebo are useful methods in homeopathic pathogenetic trials. Estimates of concordance should be introduced in proving methodology. "
"Homeopathy differs from conventional medicine in many aspects. Little recognized to date is the unique, multidimensional nature of the response to homeopathic treatment. We discuss this ‘colour’ of the homeopathic response; altered temporal awareness, paucity of language, selective amnesia, lack of self-awareness, the holistic character of the improvement, and the development of acute illnesses, all in response to successful homeopathic treatment. We conclude that, beyond its biological effect, homeopathic treatment affects the awareness. "
"Objective To systematically review the research evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for the treatment of depression and depressive disorders. Methods A comprehensive search of major biomedical databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClNAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Specialist complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) databases including AMED, CISCOM and Hom-Inform were also searched. Additionally, efforts were made to identify unpublished and ongoing research using relevant sources and experts in the field. Relevant research was categorised by study type and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for studies reporting clinical outcomes. Results Only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. One of these, a feasibility study, demonstrated problems with recruitment of patients in primary care. Several uncontrolled and observational studies have reported positive results including high levels of patient satisfaction but because of the lack of a control group, it is difficult to assess the extent to which any response is due to specific effects of homeopathy. Single-case reports/studies were the most frequently encountered clinical study type. We also found surveys, but no relevant qualitative research studies were located. Adverse effects reported appear limited to ‘remedy reactions’ (‘aggravations’) including temporary worsening of symptoms, symptom shifts and reappearance of old symptoms. These remedy reactions were generally transient but in one study, aggravation of symptoms caused withdrawal of the treatment in one patient. Conclusions A comprehensive search for published and unpublished studies has demonstrated that the evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy in depression is limited due to lack of clinical trials of high quality. Further research is required, and should include well-designed controlled studies with sufficient numbers of participants. Qualitative studies aimed at overcoming recruitment and other problems should precede further RCTs. Methodological options include the incorporation of preference arms or uncontrolled observational studies. The highly individualised nature of much homeopathic treatment and the specificity of response may require innovative methods of analysis of individual treatment response. "
"Background The ‘hygiene hypothesis’ has been used to justify a belief common among homeopaths, that the suppression of childhood infections and immunisation may lead to the development of chronic atopic diseases. Objectives To analyse the influence of childhood infections and immunisation on the development of atopy. Methods Qualitative systematic review of direct epidemiological evidence (Medline 1993–2004) concerning the influence of childhood infections and immunisation on the development of atopy and discussion based on homeopathy. Conclusions (1) Childhood infections do not protect against atopy; on the contrary, they increase the risk of allergic diseases, in agreement to Hahnemann's observations, which included epidemic diseases among the factors capable of stimulating the development of chronic diseases. (2) Vaccination is not a risk factor for atopy, notwithstanding the allergenic effect of some vaccines. "
"There is a crucial difference between vaccinosis and a vaccine reaction, which can have significant clinical implications. Unfortunately, in much of the discussion around vaccination, this distinction becomes blurred. A vaccine reaction, if properly managed, need have no adverse effects, but failure to recognise it and act accordingly can lead to the creation of a vaccinosis. Vaccinosis can also be established as a primary condition. The imperatives and protocols involved with vaccination vary considerably between the medical and veterinary professions, but our common homeopathic approach provides us with the means of assessing every situation from the perspective of the body's reaction, and thus to appreciate the true significance of what is happening to our patient. "
"Twenty-eight patients with xerostomia participated in a blind, placebo-controlled longitudinal study of the possible effects of homeopathic medicines on oral discomfort. All patients were first divided in two groups according to their medication. After that the two groups were randomly assigned according to a coin-toss to the experimental or control group. Most patients had systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and/or Sjögren's syndrome, and frequent daily medications. The randomly selected experimental group (n=15) got an individually prescribed homeopathic medicine and the control group (n=13) a placebo substance (sugar granules), both for 6 weeks. Neither group knew of the nature of the medicine. Oral dryness was evaluated by measurement of unstimulated and wax-stimulated salivary flow rates and visual analogue scale. With only two exceptions, the experimental group experienced a significant relief of xerostomia whereas no such effect was found in the placebo group. Stimulated salivary flow rate was slightly higher with homeopathy than placebo but no consistent changes occurred in salivary immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG) levels. n n In an open follow-up period those receiving homeopathic medicine continued treatment and the placebo group patients were treated with individually prescribed homeopathic medicines. The symptoms of xerostomia improved in both groups. Our results suggest that individually prescribed homeopathic medicine could be a valuable adjunct to the treatment of oral discomfort and xerostomic symptoms. n n "
"Mastitis is the major problem of dairy animals despite a number of preventive and therapeutic approaches. Treatment is costly and out of reach of farmers of developing countries like India. The treatment cost of bovine mastitis with conventional treatment has been calculated. Good results have been claimed with homeopathic treatment however, treatment costs are not available. This article reports the treatment economics of homeopathic drugs conventional drugs for the management of bovine mastitis. Ninety-six mastitic quarters (non-fibrosed 67 and fibrosed 29) were treated with a homeopathic combination medicine. Another 96 quarters with acute mastitis (non-fibrosed) treated with different antibiotics were included in the study. The animals were selected from dairy farm of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and from private dairy farms. The overall effectiveness of homeopathic combination medicine in the treatment of acute non-fibrosed mastitis was 86.6% with a mean recovery period of 7.7 days (range 3–28), and total cost of therapy as Indian Rupees 21.4 (€0.39, US$0.47). The corresponding cure rate for the antibiotic group was 59.2% with a mean recovery period of 4.5 days (range 2–15) and an average treatment cost of Rs.149.20 (€2.69, US$3.28). We conclude that the combination of Phytolacca, Calcarea fluorica., Silica, Belladonna, Bryonia, Arnica, Conium and Ipecacuanha (Healwell VT-6) was effective and economical in the management of mastitis in lactating dairy cows.

"Histamine is a central neurotransmitter, it increases arousal via H1 receptors. This study examines the effect of ultra-diluted histamine on arousal through changes in the sleep pattern of Wistar rats. The spectral density in delta (0.5–2.5 Hz) band, one of the three major spectral components of the sleep-electroencephalogram, was analyzed against time. Rats were randomized to receive histamine 30c (histamine 30c, 0.05 ml every 20 min during the first 2 h orally), histamine intraperitoneal pre-treatment/histamine 30c (histamine 6 mg/kg i.p., followed by histamine 30c) or solvent control. The mean delta band spectral density was lower in the histamine 30c and histamine pretreatment/histamine 30c groups than the control group. Significant differences between histamine 30c and baseline during the first 2 h imply an immediate effect. These results also suggest a dynamic process in which the system spontaneously evolves between two locally stationary states according to a power law. From the time perspective, the system approaches, asymptotically, an equifinal state. 1 1 "

"Background Mortality in patients with severe sepsis remains high despite the development of several therapeutic strategies. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether homeopathy is able to influence long-term outcome in critically ill patients suffering from severe sepsis. Methods Seventy patients with severe sepsis received homeopathic treatment (n=35) or placebo (n=35). Five globules in a potency of 200c were given at 12 h interval during the stay at the intensive care unit. Survival after a 30 and 180 days was recorded. n n n n Results Three patients (2 homeopathy, 1 placebo) were excluded from the analyses because of incomplete data. All these patients survived. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, prior conditions, APACHE II score, signs of sepsis, number of organ failures, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors or veno-venous hemofiltration, and laboratory parameters were not significantly different between groups. On day 30, there was non-statistically significantly trend of survival in favour of homeopathy (verum 81.8%, placebo 67.7%, P=0.19). On day 180, survival was statistically significantly higher with verum homeopathy (75.8% vs 50.0%, P=0.043). No adverse effects were observed. P vs P P vs P Conclusions Our data suggest that homeopathic treatment may be an useful additional therapeutic measure with a long-term benefit for severely septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit. A constraint to wider application of this method is the limited number of trained homeopaths. "
"Objective: To evaluate the patient reported effects of homeopathic care 6 months after first consultations. Methods: Prospective uncontrolled observational multicentre outcome study. All patients visiting 80 homeopaths all over Norway for the first time in eight different time periods from 1996 to 1998 were approached. Patients wrote down their main complaint and scored its impact on daily living on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at the first consultation. Six months later they were asked to score again. The homeopaths recorded treatments given for up to two follow-up consultations. Main outcome measure: Predefined as a reduction of at least 10 mm in the VAS score between the first consultation and follow-up. Result: Patients 1097 were recruited, 654 completed the follow-up questionnaire. The main complaint improved by at least 10 mm on the VAS for 71% (95% confidence interval 67–74%) of patients. The average reduction was 32 mm (95% CI 30–35 mm). Fifty-one per cent (95% CI 48–55%) of the patients had an improvement in their general well being of more than 10 mm. The mean reduction in the whole group was 14 mm (95% CI 12–16 mm). The proportion of patients using conventional medication reduced from 39% to 16%. Regression analysis showed that lower age and higher baseline score were predictors of better outcome. Conclusion: In this study, seven out of ten patients visiting a Norwegian homeopath reported a meaningful improvement in their main complaint 6 months after the initial consultation. "

"Canova is a homeopathic complex medicine, used as an immune modulator. We studied its effects in normal and sarcoma 180-bearing mice. Three control groups were also evaluated. The mice were examined at daily intervals and the tumours observed histologically. Peripheral blood was analysed by flow cytometry. Canova A delay in the development, and a reduction in size of the tumours, and increased infiltration by lymphoid cells, granulation tissue, and fibrosis surrounding the tumour were observed with active treatment compared to control. All animals from the treated group survived, 30% of control groups died. In 30% of treated animals, a total regression of the tumour was confirmed using light microscopy, no regression was found in the control groups. Treatment with Canova increased total numbers of leukocytes and lymphocytes. Among lymphocytes, TCD4, increased in normal-treated group and B and NK cells in S180-treated groups. The results reflect enhanced immune response of the host after treatment with Canova. Canova Canova Canova Canova Canova "

"Objectives: A pharmacoeconomic study to compare, in terms of: medical effectiveness, quality of life and costs two treatment strategies (‘homeopathic strategy’ vs ‘antibiotic strategy’) used in routine medical practice by allopathic and homeopathic GPs in the treatment of recurrent acute rhinopharyngitis in 18-month to 4-year-old children. Objectives vs Methods: Statistical analysis of data obtained from a population of 499 patients included in a previous 6-month prospective, pragmatic study. The patients were re-grouped according to type of drug prescribed. Medical effectiveness was assessed in terms of (i) episodes of acute rhinopharyngitis, (ii) complications, (iii) adverse effects. Quality of life was assessed using the Par-Ent-Qol© scale. Direct medical costs (medical consultations, drug prescriptions, prescriptions for further tests) and indirect medical costs (sick-leave) were evaluated from three viewpoints (society, patient, Social Security) using public prices and French Social Security tariffs.

"The success of Homeopathy in curing many diseases has been a serious challenge to science. Nineteenth century explanations for the healing process of Homeopathy cannot withstand the scrutiny of modern science and need to be abandoned or modified. The surviving propositions are discussed. A biocybernetic model with multilevels of electromagnetic feedback loops offers a hope of explaining the healing process. This model, its explanation of the healing process and experimental support are elaborated. "
"Two homeopathic drug provings (HDPs) of RNA have been published. The methods are reviewed. Our method is double-blind and placebo-controlled, conforms to GCP and includes run-in and follow-up phases. Symptoms are selected from diaries according to predefined criteria. The results of the provings are compared with each other and with the homeopathic clinical use of RNA. At this stage it is difficult to draw conclusions concerning the clinical use of RNA. Further HDPs are required, they should follow GCP and standard, transparent protocols. "
"Complementary and alternative treatment (CAT) is increasingly popular with patients and health-care providers. In the western societies an increasing number of patients with asthma and allergy combine conventional and CAT. But health-care providers knowledge about the different treatment models applied within the conventional health care system and alternative treatment is generally poor. ‘Treatment model’ includes understanding of disease, diagnostic approach, treatment methods and expected effects of treatment. Different treatment models represent different social constructions of understanding. We present a conceptualization of general practitioners’ (GPs) and classic homeopaths’ (CHs) perceptions of their treatment models in patients with asthma and allergy. This is a first phase of a research project conducted in Denmark to study prerequisites for bridge building between conventional and alternative therapists. The research questions were: How do the GPs and the CHs describe their treatment models for asthma and allergy? What are the differences and similarities between the treatment models? Is there a logical connection between the components of the GPs and CHs treatment models? Six GPs and 11 CHs participated in semi-structured interviews. The main difference is in the GPs and CHs descriptions of the purpose of treatment. Similarities are found in the perception of a successful treatment. Both the GPs and the CHs experience treatment effects to be dependent on contextual conditions. Differences and similarities between treatment models are discussed in relation to potential bridge building between conventional and alternative health care. "
"Treatment outcome in a pilot study indicates that it is possible to assess likelihood ratios of homeopathic symptoms. Entries in repertory rubrics can be validated, but must still be handled carefully. Prospective research is the only acceptable way. Software to support this research must be carefully designed to export correct data. "
"Homeopathic medicines are regarded as safe but practitioners report several types of healing or remedy reactions including aggravations, new symptoms and recurrence of old symptoms, some of which could be regarded as side effects or unwanted effects. Some remedy reactions may be regarded as adverse events. Audit Questions: Do such reactions occur within our unit, and if so, how frequently? Do patients regard these events as “adverse”? Audit Questions Methods: The audit was carried out in the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital Outpatient Department. All patients were given a questionnaire to complete when at their first follow-up consultation approx 6–10 weeks after their first appointment. One hundered and sixteen patients were sampled over a 2-month period. Methods Results: Reactions were frequent: 28 out of the 116 (24%) patients, experienced an aggravation. Thirteen patients (11%) reported an adverse event even though 5 of those were patients who also reported an aggravation followed by an overall improvement of their symptoms. Thirty-one patients described new symptoms (27%) and 21(18%), a return of old symptoms. Those experiencing the latter appeared to have better outcomes. Results Conclusions: Remedy reactions are common in clinical practice; some patients experience them as adverse events. Systematically recording side effects would facilitate our understanding of these reactions and would enable standards to be set for audit of information and patient care.

"Following surgery for carcinoma of the breast, patients receive local radiotherapy. This can cause itching, which may be severe, in the radiation field. The affected skin usually is dry, rough and red. Twenty-five patients were treated homeopathically for radiation-induced itching. Fourteen patients developed itching during their course of postoperative radiation at 27 days median (range: 14–40). Eleven patients experienced itching in the radiation field after completion of treatment (median 21 days) after the end of their radiation treatment. A single dose of an individually selected homeopathic medicine in 30C dilution was given in the clinic, on the basis of repertorisation. Patients were asked to record a visual analogue scale (VAS) before prescription of the homeopathic medicine and at follow-up. on the basis of repertorisation Patients were evaluated at median 3 days (range: 1–27 days) after administration of the homeopathic medicine. In total, 14 of 25 patients (56%) responded to the first medicine. Nine patients had a second medicine, seven responded. Altogether 21 of 25 (84%) patients were successfully treated. The following medicines were employed successfully: Fl-ac 9/13, Rhus-t 3/5, Caust 2/3, Ign 2/2, Psor 2/2, γ-ray 2/2 and Kali-bi 1/1. The VAS measurements before and after homeopathic treatment showed a reduction of the median value of 64 mm (range: 20–100 mm) to 34 mm (median; range: 0–84 mm). Homeopathic treatment of radiation-induced itching appears quite successful. The most frequently indicated and most frequently effective medicine was Fluoric acid. An approach that allows greater understanding of the patient as a whole in the short time available in a busy clinic may be required.

"Atropa belladonna and Echinacea angustifolia have been used in homeopathy as modulators of inflammatory processes, in simple potency or ‘accord of potencies’, as recommended by homotoxicology. We evaluated their effects on leukocyte migration and macrophage activity induced by experimental peritonitis in vivo. Mice were injected (i.p.) with LPS (1.0 mg/kg) and treated (0.3 ml/10 g/day, s.c.) with different commercial forms of these medicines. Echinacea angustifolia D4—a simple potency preparation—and Belladonna Homaccord®, Belladonna Injeel®, Belladonna Injeel Forte®, Echinacea Injeel® and Echinacea Injeel Forte®—all in ‘accord of potencies’—were tested. Atropa belladonna Echinacea angustifolia in vivo Echinacea angustifolia D4 Belladonna Homaccord ® Belladonna Injeel ® Belladonna Injeel Forte ® Echinacea Injeel ® Echinacea Injeel Forte ® The association of A. belladonna and E. angustifolia in ‘accord of potencies’ produced an increase of polymorphonuclear cell migration (Kruskal-Wallis, P=0.03) and a decrease of mononuclear cell percentages (Kruskal-Wallis, P⩽0.04), when compared with control, mainly in preparations containing low potencies. The proportion of degenerate leukocytes was lower in the treated groups, compared to a control group (P⩽0.05). The treated groups showed increased phagocytosis (P⩽0.05), mainly in preparations containing high potencies.

"Background: Homeopathic pathogenetic trials (HPTs) (provings) are the pillar of homeopathy. Symptoms experienced by healthy volunteers are used to find the correct medicine for therapy. It is unclear whether these symptoms are specific or due to placebo noise. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether proving effects, if present at all, are due to a local or non-local process Background  Objectives: To develop a test model which allows for testing if homeopathic proving symptoms are caused by placebo or causative mechanisms, and if these symptoms are due to local or non-local processes. Objectives  Design: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, with 1-week baseline and 2-weeks proving period. Design  Subjects: 11 healthy volunteers from two different homeopathic schools. Subjects  Proving substance: An homeopathic medicine (Cantharis 30c), blindly chosen from 12 potential medicines, compared to placebo. Proving substance Cantharis  Outcome measure: Number of symptoms typical for the medicine in the experimental and control group during baseline and proving period. Outcome measure  Results: During baseline there was no difference in the number of typical or atypical symptoms in either group. During the proving period, both more typical symptoms for Cantharis (P = 0.03) and more atypical symptoms (P = 0.02) were observed compared to baseline. Between-group differences were not significant. Effect sizes for the difference between the proving and control group for typical symptoms was d = 0.4, and for atypical symptoms d = 0.6. Results Cantharis P P d d  Discussion: This proving model could be valuable in studying the validity of proving symptoms of homeopathic substances in healthy volunteers. Discussion  Conclusion: Homeopathic proving symptoms appear to be specific to the medicine and do not seem to be due to a local process. Since this was a pilot study using a small number of provers, rival hypotheses cannot be ruled out and the study needs replication.

"The authors’ experience of conducting clinical trials in homeopathy and analysing data from these has drawn attention to a fundamental problem with the interpretation of results from placebo controlled trials in homeopathy: It is not reasonable to assume that the specific effects of homeopathic medicine and the non-specific effects of consultations are independent of each other—specific effects of the medicine (as manifested by patients’ reactions) may influence the nature of subsequent consultations and the non-specific effects of the consultation may enhance or diminish the effects of the medicine. For clinical trials of homeopathy to be accurate representations of practice, we need modified designs that take into account the complexity of the homeopathic intervention. Only with such trials will the results be generalisable to homeopathic practice in the real world. The authors propose that comparative trials are a meaningful way of evaluating the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment. "
"Objective: To systematically review the literature on the ability of low-dose (LD) and ultra-low-dose (ULD) toxin exposure to prevent and treat biological and chemical threats. Methods: Laboratory research articles on protection or treatment from LD or ULD exposure for the 13 high-risk chemical and biological warfare threats were collected and systematically evaluated for quantity and scientific quality using pre-defined methodological criteria. Results: Over 2600 articles were screened. Only five studies met the inclusion criteria examining stimulation and protective effects of LD- or ULD-exposures to the 13 pre-identified biological and chemical agents. The quality evaluation (QE) of these studies was above average with a mean QE score of 70.6% of maximum. Two articles of fair to good quality reported both protective and treatment efficacy from exposure of animals or humans to LD- and ULD-exposures to toxins of risk in biochemical warfare. Conclusion: There is little research on agents of biological and chemical warfare investigating the possible use of LD- and ULD-toxins for protection and treatment. The existing literature is generally of good quality and indicates that rapid induction of protective tolerance is a feasible but under-investigated approach to bioterrorist or biowarfare defense. In our opinion, further research into the role of induced protection with LD- and ULD-toxic agents is needed. "
"Proteins, with the large variety of chemical groups they present at their molecular surface, are a class of molecules which can be very informative on most of the possible solute–solvent interactions. Hen egg white lysozyme has been used as a probe to investigate the complex solvent dynamics occurring at the protein surface, by analysing the results obtained from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, X-ray diffractometry and Molecular Dynamics simulations. A consistent overall picture for the dynamics of water molecules close to the protein is obtained, suggesting that a rapid exchange occurs, in a picosecond timescale, among all the possible hydration surface sites both in solution and the solid state, excluding the possibility that solvent molecules can form liquid–crystal-like supramolecular adducts, which have been proposed as a molecular basis of ‘memory of water’.

"The Organon of Medicine is the seminal text of Homeopathy. However, its grammar and structure make it obtuse and remote to both new students and veterans. We propose a demarcation of the Organon into sections, exposing the didactic structure of the Organon, and display this demarcation in concise graphic form. It is hoped that this representation will improve accessibility and understanding of the Organon for readers at all levels. "
"If the likelihood ratio (LR) method is introduced, the repertory will gradually change as more symptoms are assessed. It will also change the use of the repertory: the most important medicines of each symptom rubric can be identified and relied on, even in large rubrics. This is also a good opportunity to correct structural shortcomings of the repertory, for instance, entries should be based on systematic analysis of materia medica instead of casual observations. "
"One strand of research on the scientific basis of homeopathy is based on inversion effects of dilutions and the biophysical properties of information transfer. A model developed by Endler, was the basis for the study of the influence of high-diluted solution (1:1026 part by weight) of thyroid glands on the rate of metamorphosis of the frog Rana catesbeiana from the no legged to four-legged stage. The glands were obtained from tadpoles and prepared according by (dilution and succussion). Similar pure hydroalcoholic solution (unsuccussed) was used as control. In order to identify significant differences in the frequencies of four-legged tadpoles, in homeopathic and control group, we used a chi-square goodness-of-fit test (P<0.01) and the cumulative risk for metamorphosis by Cox's Proportional Hazards model (P<0.05). The number of animals that reached the four-legged stage is generally smaller in the treated group, than in the hydroalcoholic control group. It was postulated that thyroid hormones transmitted information’ specific to the molecules used to prepare the solution, even though the molarity was beyond Avogadro's number. 26 Rana catesbeiana P P 26 Rana catesbeiana P P "
"The validity of clinical decision making in homeopathy is largely unexplored and little is understood about the process or its reliability. This exploratory study investigated, in the context of a questionnaire based re-proving of Belladonna 30c, the extent to which decisions are based on clinical facts or intuition and how reliable decisions are. Three experienced, independent homeopathic clinicians/proving researchers rated the symptom diaries of the 206 subjects taking part. They reported their proving decision (ie positive proving response, no proving response or undecided) based on the total symptom profiles and rated (on a scale of 0–10) their use of clinical facts or intuition. Keynote symptoms and overall confidence scores were also reported. The level of agreement between raters was generally poor (weighted kappa 0.349–0.064). All raters used both facts and intuition. The rater's reliance on the facts was significantly associated with classifying those subjects who had no proving response [rater 1, P < 0.001; rater 2, P < 0.001]. Raters used significantly higher intuition scores when classifying a prover [rater 2, P = 0.001; rater 3, P = 0.012]. Issues regarding the education and practice of homeopathy are discussed.

"The purpose of this study was to obtain information about the influence of successive dilutions and succussions on the water structure. ‘Extremely diluted solutions’ (EDS) are solutions obtained through the iteration of two processes: dilution in stages of 1:100 and succussion, typically used in homeopathic medicine. The iteration is repeated until extreme dilutions are reached, so that the chemical composition of the solution is identical to that of the solvent. Nine different preparations, were studied from the 3cH to 30cH (Hanhemannian Centesimal Dilution). Four of those were without the active principle (potentized water). Two different active principles were used: Arsenicum sulphuratum rubrum (ASR), As4S4, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D). The solvents were: a solution of sodium bicarbonate and of silicic acid at 5×10−5 M (mol/l) each, and solutions of sodium bicarbonate 5×10−5, 7.5×10−5 and 10×10−5 M (mol/l) in double-distilled water. The containers were Pyrex glass to avoid the release of alkaline oxide and silica from the walls. Conductivity measurements of the solutions were carried out as a function of the age of the potencies. We found increases of electrical conductivity compared to untreated solvent. Successive dilution and succussion can permanently alter the physico-chemical properties of the aqueous solvent. But we also detected changes in physio-chemical parameters with time. This has not previously been reported. The modification of the solvent could provide an important support to the validity of homeopathic medicine, that employs ‘medicines without molecules’. The nature of the phenomena here described remains still unexplained, nevertheless some significant experimental results were obtained.

"Although some sectors of dentistry have benefited from technological advances, dental caries is still a major problem. Prevention and treatment of dental caries by fluorine is considered a major advance in public health. Nevertheless fluorosis, caused by ingestion of excessive amounts of fluorine during the period of teeth formation, is of great concern. In accordance with the homeopathic doctrine, minimum doses of fluorine and other substances could prevent and/or treat caries. In this experiment, we compared the preventive action of fluorine and evaluated the effect of homeopathic medicines on the teeth of rats fed a cariogenic diet. None of the groups included in this study developed caries. However, microscopy revealed the presence of precipitate and/or deposit in the groups treated with homeopathic medicines. This phenomenon might be due to deposit in the dental surface or precipitation of bacterial plaque or calcium salts. It was not possible to identify the composition of the deposit/precipitate due for technical reasons. In one of the groups treated with homeopathic medicines fur loss was observed in 40% of animals. These reactions might be caused due to the action of the homeopathic medicines. "
"The possibility that non-linear quantum theory could be used to model PPR entanglement is discussed in relation to the treatment of miasms. In this model, miasms are imagined as disease entities behaving like solitary waves, or ‘solitons’ which, when trapped in a therapeutic state space, requiring equally soliton-like (miasmatic or high potency) remedies to effectively ‘annihilate’ them.

"A gold standard is necessary to assess the validity of homeopathic symptoms. The gold standard is ‘cure’, but this is difficult to define, and depends on consensus. The likelihood ratio (LR) method will give valid results only if the gold standard is reliable. False positives (patients incorrectly classified as cured) weaken results of LR investigation. Weakening the standard to enlarge the research population will seriously bias the results. The same gold standard should be used in LR assessment of all symptoms. "
"The anti-inflammatory effect of Arnica montana 6cH was evaluated using acute and chronic inflammation models. In the acute, model, carrageenin-induced rat paw oedema, the group treated with Arnica montana 6cH showed 30% inhibition compared to control (P<0.05). Treatment with Arnica 6cH, 30 min prior to carrageenin, did not produce any inhibition of the inflammatory process. In the chronic model, Nystatin-induced oedema, the group treated 3 days previously with Arnica montana 6cH had reduced inflammation 6 h after the inflammatory agent was applied (P<0.05). When treatment was given 6 h after Nystatin treatment, there was no significant inhibitory effect.

"Background: Chronic diseases (CD), miasms or reactional modes, remain one of the darkest concepts of homeopathy. They are supposed to be heritable and originate after suppression of other diseases. Besides this nothing is known about how they might produce the large number of diseases mentioned in homeopathic books. They have been described in a variety of terms, ranging from Kent and Gathak's spiritual or metaphysic conception; the biological-allergic by Paschero, and, Robert's materialist-nutritional point of view. Flores-Bejar et al have outlined an approach to CD from a cellular and bioenergetic point of view. Background Results: Cellular pathology has led to an understanding of the basic repair mechanisms of every cell and tissue. These mechanisms exist in order to avoid necrosis or cell death. The main mechanisms are molecular repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Results Failure of these mechanisms leads to ‘dysrepair’. Consequences of these ‘dysrepair’ mechanisms resemble the homeopathic reactional modes or miasms. These abnormal or ‘dysrepair’ mechanisms are probably the basis of miasms or reactional modes. A new interpretation of miasms is proposed: Psora corresponds to the dysmolecular reactional mode. Syphilis corresponds to dysapoptotic reactional mode. Sycosis corresponds to dysproliferative reactional mode. Background Results "

"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a GP-led practice-based homeopathy service on symptoms, activity, wellbeing, general practice consultation rate and the use of conventional medications. Data were collected for 97 consecutive patients referred to a homeopathy service between 1 July 2002 and 23 January 2003. Self-rated symptom severity, activity limitation and wellbeing were scored on a seven-point scale at initial homeopathic consultation and via postal questionnaire at a mean follow-up time of 134 days. Primary symptoms improved by a mean of 2.49 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08–2.90; P<0.0001); secondary symptoms by 2.49 points (95% CI 2.00–2.98; P<0.0001); ability to undertake activity by 2.43 points (95% CI 1.95–2.91; P<0.0001) and wellbeing by 1.41 points (95% CI 1.02–1.80; P<0.0001). Following use of the homeopathy service the mean 6-month general practice consultation rate decreased by 1.18 consultations per patient (95% CI 0.40–1.99; P=0.004). Fifty-seven per cent of patients reduced or stopped taking their conventional medication, saving £2,807.30 per year. The main limitation of this study is the absence of a control group.

"Background. Observational studies have recently contributed useful information to the debate about the utility of homeopathic treatment in everyday practice. Background Aim. To gather data about routine homeopathic general practice. Aim Setting. Eighty general medical practices in Belgium where physicians were members of the Unio Homoeopathica Belgica. Setting Methods. All patients and their physicians visiting the practices on a specified day completed a questionnaire. Methods Results. A total of 782 patients presented with diseases of all major organ systems which were of sufficient severity to interfere with daily living in 78% of cases. Compared to previous conventional treatment, patients reported that consultations were much longer but costed less. One or more conventional drug treatments were discontinued in over half (52%) of the patients: CNS (including psychotropic) drugs (21%), drugs for respiratory conditions (16%) and antibiotics (16%). Conventional drugs were prescribed to about a quarter of patients (27%), mostly antibiotics and cardiovascular medication. The antibiotics were almost exclusively (95%) used to treat respiratory infections. Prescription costs (including conventional medicines) were one-third of the general practice average. Patients’ satisfaction with their homeopathic treatment was very high (95% fairly or very satisfied), and ratings of their previous treatment was much lower (20%). The great majority (89%) said that homeopathy had improved their physical condition; 8.5% said that it had made no difference, 2.4% said that homeopathy had worsened their condition. Physicians’ ratings of improvement were similar. Previous conventional treatment had improved 13% of patients, made no difference to 32%, and had worsened the condition of over half (55%). A similar pattern was seen for psychological symptoms. Results Conclusions: Patients were very satisfied with their homeopathic treatment, both they and their physicians recorded significant improvement. Costs of homeopathic treatment were significantly lower than conventional treatment, and many previously prescribed drugs were discontinued.

"We report an uncontrolled observational study of the treatment of udder diseases of buffalo, using a homeopathic complex medicine. Mastitis is an economically important disease of buffaloes. In India economic losses due to mastitis are estimated at US$526 million annually. Conventional veterinary treatment relies on costly antibiotics; cure rate is only 60% in field conditions with a problem of milk residues. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a homeopathic complex in the management of clinical udder health problems of riverine buffaloes. Cases of subclinical mastitis were excluded from the study. A total of 102 mastitic quarters (fibrosed—40, nonfibrosed—62) and five cases each of blood in milk and udder oedema in lactating buffaloes were treated with a homeopathic complex consisting of Phytolacca 200c, Calcarea fluorica 200c, Silicea 30c, Belladona 30c, Bryonia 30c, Arnica 30c, Conium 30c and Ipecacuanha 30c. The diagnosis of udder diseases and recovery criterion was based on physical examination of udder and milk and CMT/WST score. Bacteriological analysis and somatic cell count were not performed. Phytolacca Calcarea fluorica Silicea Belladona Bryonia Arnica Conium Ipecacuanha Treatment was 80 and 96.72% effective in cases of fibrotic mastitis and nonfibrosed mastitis respectively. Recovery period was 21–42 days (fibrosed) and 4–15 days (nonfibrosed). Udder oedema and blood in milk responded favourably in 2–5 days. Cost of treatment was US$ 0.07 per day. The homeopathic complex medicine may be effective and economical in the management of udder health problems of buffaloes. Definitive conclusions are premature due to the limited number of observations and lack of control group. Phytolacca Calcarea fluorica Silicea Belladona Bryonia Arnica Conium Ipecacuanha "
"The possibility of classifying and unifying some of the recent entanglement models for homeopathy is discussed. Unification involves combining the previous GHZ/WQT-based entanglement model, itself a fusion of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) three-particle entanglement and a generalised version of quantum theory, called Weak Quantum Theory (WQT), with Walach's semiotic model involving double entanglement. The new combined model invokes a ‘geometry’ of patient–practitioner–remedy (PPR) entanglement embedded in a therapeutic state space. "

"The anti-inflammatory effect of Causticum was evaluated using acute and chronic inflammatory models in vivo. The administration of concentrated Causticum solution into the hind paw of rats produced an inflammatory reaction with oedema formation within the first hour, showing that Causticum acts as an oedematogenic agent. Carrageenin induced rat paw oedema was significantly inhibited (P<0.05) in the group treated with Causticum 30cH solution compared to control. Groups treated with potentized Causticum (6cH, 12cH, 30cH and 200cH), showed significant inhibition (P<0.05) of the inflammation pre-induced by carrageenin. However pre-treatment with Causticum 30cH for 6 days (0.5 ml, daily) did not significantly inhibit granulation using an implantation method.

"Homeopathy is founded on ‘holistic’ and ‘vitalistic’ paradigms, which may be interpreted—at least in part—in terms of a framework provided by the theory of dynamic systems and of complexity. The conceptual models and some experimental findings from complexity science may support the paradoxical claims of similia principle and of dilution/dynamization effects. It is argued that better appreciation of three main properties of complex systems: non-linearity, self-organization, and dynamicity, will not only add to our basic understanding of homeopathic phenomena but also illuminate new directions for experimental investigations and therapeutic settings.

"This comparative quantitative study explored General Practitioners’ (GPs) attitudes to homeopathy in Dumfries and Galloway, a predominantly rural area in South West Scotland where there is a local British Homeopathic Association Funded Homeopathic Clinic. It aimed to determine whether there was an association between expressed attitudes to homeopathy and a number of variables. Issues arising from the House of Lords Report on CAM were also explored. A self-administered questionnaire was addressed to all 135 GPs within Dumfries and Galloway. Descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis. The response rate was 75%. The NHS GP clinic accounted for 47% of total referrals for homeopathy. A total of 86.1% of GPs within Dumfries and Galloway were in favour of a local NHS Homeopathic Specialist Clinic. Forms of evidence most influential to GPs regarding homeopathy were: randomised controlled trials; audit data on patient outcomes; safety and patient satisfaction. "
"Context: This research aimed at verifying the efficacy of homeopathic treatments by plant-based bioassays, which may be suitable for basic research, because they lack placebo effects and provide large datasets for statistical analyses.

"Pruritus is a frequent and difficult to treat problem in haemodialysis. This double-blind placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial assessed the role of homeopathic treatment in this situation. The code was held by the pharmacist who dispensed the medications. Pruritus was evaluated using a previously published scale. Only patients with initial values above 25% of maximum pruritus score were entered. Data were analysed after partial code break, separating the two groups of patients, but with no awareness of which one received verum or placebo. Patients were classified as responders if they had >50% reduction of pruritus score. Twenty-eight patients (16M/12F, 51±11 years of age) were entered and 20 (12M/8F, 52±8 years of age) remained for final analysis: 11 in the verum group, 9 in placebo. At entry, the mean pruritus score was 65±25% for the treated patients and 70±27% for placebo. After 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of follow-up, pruritis score were respectively: 46±29, 41±30, 42±29, and 38±33 for the treated patients and 61±29, 67±31, 64±35, and 57±39 for placebo. Reduction was statistically significant (P<0.05) at every point of observation. According to the patients’ own assessment, at the end of the study period, the homeopathic treatment reduced the pruritus score by ∼49%.

"A pilot study was performed to investigate the possibilities and restrictions of likelihood ratio (LR) investigation using three symptoms. Qualitative vagueness and expectation bias is inherent in our method, but is, in part avoidable. It appears that experienced observers assess common homeopathic symptoms quite similarly. Clinical judgement is an essential part of our work and should be preserved during assessment of LR. The assessment does not influence clinical practice and can be maintained for a long period, provided the appropriate software is used. A limited range of symptoms seems most suitable for LR investigation. "

"Little is known about the practice of homeopathic general practitioners (GPs) in France. We report a descriptive, cross-sectional study on this subject. The aim was to acquire a clearer idea of (1) the type of patients who consult homeopathic GPs and (2) the type of treatment provided by such GPs, in terms of diagnoses, prescriptions and costs. The survey was carried out on a representative sample of the French homeopathic GP population and covered three seasons of the year. The data was collected by means of a questionnaire which GPs completed for each consulting patient. It emerged that the type of patients who consult homeopathic GPs are chiefly women, between the ages of 20 and 54, living in an urban environment, not in employment, covered by National Health Insurance for Salaried Workers, and belonging to a Mutual Benefit Association. The most common reasons for consultation were ENT disorders, stress and anxiety. The homeopathic GPs mainly used homeopathy to treat these disorders. On average, four medicinal products per patient were prescribed per 2-month course of treatment, for an average reimbursed cost of 3.78€. "
"The nature of the ‘active ingredient’, in homeopathic high dilutions is investigated. A model for every degree of dilution is introduced; within this the active ingredient can be dealt with in physical terms. In mathematical terms this model has features which correspond to the axioms of weak quantum theory. Features which are similar to entanglement in ordinary quantum theory are discussed in particular. "
"The notion of patient–practitioner–remedy (PPR) entanglement, previously proposed for homeopathy, is refined by adapting concepts derived from Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger's treatment of three-particle entanglement (GHZ states), and a generalised version of quantum theory, called weak quantum theory (WQT). These suggest that for maximum PPR entanglement during the therapeutic encounter, the practitioner's awareness needs to be directed inward as well as outward toward the patient, and that health and disease are mirror images of each other, similar to and represented by, the relationship of complex numbers to their complex conjugates.

"This paper reports on an investigation of the homeopathic approach to the management of symptoms of oestrogen withdrawal in women with breast cancer. Forty-five patients entered the study. The most common presenting symptoms were hot flushes (HF) (n = 38), mood disturbance (n = 23), joint pain (n = 12), and fatigue (n = 16). Other symptoms included sleeplessness, reduced libido, weight gain, cystitis, vaginal dryness and skin eruptions. The active intervention was an individualised homeopathic medicine. Forty women (89%) completed the study. Significant improvements in mean symptom scores were seen over the study period and for the primary end-point ‘the effect on daily living’ scores. Symptoms other than HF such as fatigue and mood disturbance appear to be helped. Significant improvements in anxiety, depression and quality of life were demonstrated over the study period. The homeopathic approach appears to be clinically useful in the management of oestrogen withdrawal symptoms in women with breast cancer whether on or off Tamoxifen and improves mood disturbance.

"The potentisation process by which homeopathic preparations are produced raises the concern that these medicines have placebo effects only, since they theoretically no longer contain active molecules of the diluted substance. Plant models offer a method of examining the efficacy of homeopathically prepared solutions. This study examined the effects of homeopathically prepared gibberellic acid (HGA3) on the germination performance of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds. The effect of HGA3 (4–200 cH) on seed germination rate and seedling development was compared to that of the most commonly used form of gibberellic acid (GA3), 0.5 g l−1, and control (distilled water). The extent and type of response was dependent on the vigour level of the seedlot. Treating seeds from three vigour groups in HGA3 consistently resulted in larger seedlings. High-vigour seeds treated with HGA3 4, 30 and 200 cH germinated faster, and roots of medium-vigour seedlots treated in HGA3 15 cH were longer. Biphasic effects of HGA3 were also demonstrated. As a plant model, germinating barley seeds successfully demonstrated the ability of HGA3 to produce a biological response. 3 Hordeum vulgare 3 3 −1 3 3 3 3 3 3 Hordeum vulgare 3 3 −1 3 3 3 3 3 "
"Background. The claims made for the clinical effects of homeopathy are controversial. The results of several meta-analyses of clinical trials are positive, but they fail in general to highlight specific medical conditions that respond well to homeopathy. Background. Aims. This review examines the cumulative research from randomised and/or double-blind clinical trials (RCTs) in homeopathy for individual medical conditions reported since 1975, and asks the question: What is the weight of the original evidence from published RCTs that homeopathy has an effect that is statistically significantly different from that in a comparative group? Aims. Method. Analysis of the 93 substantive RCTs that compare homeopathy either with placebo or another treatment. Method. Results. 50 papers report a significant benefit of homeopathy in at least one clinical outcome measure, 41 that fail to discern any inter-group differences, and two that describe an inferior response with homeopathy. Considering the relative number of research articles on the 35 different medical conditions in which such research has been carried out, the weight of evidence currently favours a positive treatment effect in eight: childhood diarrhoea, fibrositis, hayfever, influenza, pain (miscellaneous), side-effects of radio- or chemotherapy, sprains and upper respiratory tract infection. Based on published research to date, it seems unlikely that homeopathy is efficacious for headache, stroke or warts. Insufficient research prevents conclusions from being drawn about any other medical conditions. Results Conclusions. The available research evidence emphasises the need for much more and better-directed research in homeopathy. A fresh agenda of enquiry should consider beyond (but include) the placebo-controlled trial. Each study should adopt research methods and outcome measurements linked to a question addressing the clinical significance of homeopathy's effects. Conclusions clinical Background. Aims. Method.

"There is little research on cost–effectiveness of homeopathy in General Practice. This study aimed to compare the costs of homeopathic prescribing with conventional drugs prescribing. Data were collected for 4 years on all patients who were treated homeopathically. Costs of homeopathic remedies and costs of conventional drugs which otherwise would be prescribed for these patients was calculated for the total duration of treatment. Savings were calculated. One hundred patients were included in the study. Average cost savings per patient was £60.40. The majority of patients had improved and most did not report any side-effects. The limitations of this study are that it is based on one GP's work, with a small number of patients so definite and generalisable conclusions cannot be drawn. Moreover, calculated costs in this study are based on drugs only, it does not take into account doctor's time, special investigations and time off sick. Future work needs to be carried out to include all of these points for a comprehensive economic analysis. "
"The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of homeopathic treatment of intractable atopic dermatitis (IAD). Seventeen IAD patients were given individualized homeopathic treatment in addition to conventional dermatological therapy from 6 months to 2 years and 7 months. Although all of the patients had previously been treated with conventional medicine and various psychological approaches, they had had severe conditions and shown no significant sign of improvement. The efficacy of homeopathic treatment was measured by objective assessments of the skin condition and the patients’ own assessments, using a 9 point scale similar to the Glasgow Homeopathic Outcome Scale, was used. Over 50% improvement was reported in overall impression and in their skin conditions by all patients, in itchiness by 15 of the patients, in sleep disturbance by 10 out of 13 patients, in satisfaction in daily life by nine out of 12, in fulfillment at work by seven out of 11 and in satisfaction with human relations by 10 out of 14.

"Homeopathic aggravations have often been described anecdotally. However, few attempts have been made to scientifically verify their existence. This systematic review aimed at comparing the frequency of homeopathic aggravations in the placebo and verum groups of double-blind, randomised clinical trials. Eight independent literature searches were carried out to identify all such trials mentioning either adverse effects or aggravations. All studies thus found were validated and data were extracted by both authors. Twenty-four trials could be included. The average number of aggravations was low. In total, 50 aggravations were attributed to patients treated with placebo and 63 to patients treated with homoeopathically diluted remedies. We conclude that this systematic review does not provide clear evidence that the phenomenon of homeopathic aggravations exists. "
"Antibiotic resistance is a global public health problem. Once confined primarily to hospitals it is now increasingly common in primary care. The prevalence of resistant bacteria is rising, and organisms resistant to almost all antibiotics have been identified. The main causes are indiscriminate prescribing and the use of antibiotics in animal feeds and other agricultural applications. Policies to restrict use of antibiotics have had limited success. Homeopathy may have a role to play in combating the development of antibiotic resistance. Clinical research suggests that homeopathy is effective in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in children, a frequent cause of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. The EU recommends the use of homeopathy in organic animal husbandry, and it is used by significant numbers of farmers. At present there is little data on the effectiveness of homeopathy in this setting. Further research should be done. "
"Background: In modern pharmaceutical practice, it is common to use purified ethanol and purified water for the preparation of homeopathic dilutions. Hahnemann in 1827 recommended good brandy as a diluent. Brandy contains a lot of accompanying substances in addition to ethanol. Background: Purpose of the study: The research question was whether different diluents influence the effectiveness of high dilutions, especially above Avogadro's number. We compared two dilution media to investigate the diluent's influence. Within the limitations of the test-system, the dilution media were as similar to good brandy as possible and like purified ethanol. Dilutions of histamine were prepared with both media. As test-system, we used modified basophil activation in an in vitro cell system. Basophils are activated by anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE). The activation of basophils is inhibited by prior incubation with histamine. The reduction in activation was measured with different dilutions of histamine. The test system used a 3-colour flow cytometric method. The interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor CD123 was used to identify basophils in the leukocyte mixture. The CD63 surface marker was used for quantification of activated basophils. Purpose of the study: in vitro Results: With higher concentrations of histamine, we observed inhibition on optimally anti-IgE-stimulated basophil activation with a clear concentration dependency. With low concentrations of histamine (up to 10-31), we also observed inhibition of IgE-mediated basophil activation. Differences were observed between the dilution media. Results: -31 Conclusion: The preliminary results support the hypothesis that the dilution medium may influence the effects of high dilutions. This could be of importance for homeopathic pharmaceutical practice as well as for ultra-high dilution experiments. The refined basophil test system proved to be highly sensitive and reliable. Further studies are needed. Conclusion: Background: Purpose of the study: in vitro Results: -31 Conclusion: "
"It is argued that succussion drives the homeopathic tincture undergoing potentisation to a turbulent regime, where vortices continually form and disappear, ranging in size from the linear extent of the container to a minimum scale determined by viscosity and the rate of energy dissipation. Input mechanical energy cascades down this population of eddies and becomes available at the microscopic level to perform work (chemical, electrical, etc). A structure generated in the tincture would be rupted by vortices smaller than it, and this sets definite limits on the strength of succussion, so the power input leads to larger vortices than the structures one is trying to create and preserve through potentisation. An experimental procedure to test this proposal is suggested, based on Rayleigh scattering. "
"Seeking to understand the individual in his symptomatic totality has been an aim of homeopathy since its beginning. Throughout its history, homeopaths have been concerned that inadequate treatment of acute diseases in childhood may lead to future chronic diseases. Hahnemann cautioned that by treating acute diseases with allopathic medicine, with strong doses of drugs, or suppressing local symptoms of those diseases, would increase the risk of future chronic diseases. Burnett proposed the theory of vaccinosis and warned of chronic manifestations subsequent to smallpox vaccination. French homeopaths, seeking the physiopathological origin of chronic diseases, correlated it to the abnormal reaction of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Through the study of experimental pathology, Maffei attributed symptomatic manifestations to the imbalance between the immunological phenomena of allergy and immunity. He termed the sensitizing and pathogenic effects of medications and vaccines, ‘metallergy’ and ‘parallergy’, respectively. The hygiene hypothesis is based on evidence that the imbalance of immunological response in childhood, specifically among the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subpopulations, is responsible for the development of some allergic and chronic diseases in the future. The deranging factor for the predisposition to future allergic response (Th2) is the obstruction of natural manifestations of infectious diseases (Th1 response) in young children. Homeopathic treatment aims to equilibrate vital reaction, corresponding to an integrative physiological response, it may regulate Th1/Th2 imbalance. However, clinical trials to support this hypothesis are lacking. "
"Mercuric chloride 30c and Mercuric iodide 30c were prepared by successive dilution in 30 steps of 1:100 followed by sonication at 20 KHz for 30 s at each step.

The controls for the water and ethanol–water preparations were pure water 30c and 90% ethanol 30c, respectively. For the three water preparations there were three matched controls of water 30c of the same ages. Each potentized substance or its control was mixed with distilled water 1 : 100 before testing.

"Background: There is little research on the use of over-the-counter (OTC) homeopathic medicines. Background: Objectives: To obtain data on conditions treated by OTC homeopathy; perceived effectiveness; how long respondents had used OTC homeopathy; if respondents combined them with prescription drugs; reasons for using OTC homeopathy. Objectives: Methods: 75 users of OTC homeopathy completed questionnaires while purchasing OTC homeopathic remedies in three health food shops in central Manchester. Methods: Results: The most frequently treated conditions were respiratory, mental/psychological and bruises/injuries. Respondents perceived OTC homeopathy to be effective for relieving these conditions. There was a trend for respondent's first using OTC homeopathy 4 or more years previously. Thirteen per cent combined it prescription drugs. The most strongly endorsed reasons for using OTC homeopathy were that was a natural treatment and was perceived as harmless.

"Objective: To test whether an ultramolecular dilution of homeopathic Thyroidinum has an effect over placebo on weight reduction of fasting patients in so-called ‘fasting crisis’. Thyroidinum Design: Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, monocentre study. Setting/location: Hospital for internal and complementary medicine in Munich, Germany. Subjects: Two hundred and eight fasting patients encountering a stagnation or increase of weight after a weight reduction of at least 100 g/day in the preceding 3 days. Intervention: One oral dose ofThyroidinum 30cH (preparation of thyroid gland) or placebo. Thyroidinum Outcome Measures: Main outcome measure was reduction of body weight 2 days after treatment. Secondary outcome measures were weight reduction on days 1 and 3, 15 complaints on days 1–3, and 34 laboratory findings on days 1–2 after treatment. Results: Weight reduction on the second day after medication in the Thyroidinum group was less than in the placebo group (mean difference 92 g, 95% confidence interval 7–176 g, P=0.034). Adjustment for baseline differences in body weight and rate of weight reduction before medication, however, weakened the result to a non-significant level (P=0.094). There were no differences between groups in the secondary outcome measures. Thyroidinum P P Conclusions: Patients receiving Thyroidinum had less weight reduction on day 2 after treatment than those receiving placebo. Yet, since no significant differences were found in other outcomes and since adjustment for baseline differences rendered the difference for the main outcome measure non-significant, this result must be interpreted with caution. Post hoc evaluation of the data, however, suggests that by predefining the primary outcome measure in a different way, an augmented reduction of weight on day 1 after treatment with Thyroidinum may be demonstrated. Both results would be compatible with homeopathic doctrine (primary and secondary effect) as well as with findings from animal research.

"Four double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials of asthma or rhinitis treated with homeopathic immunotherapy (HIT) at a 30C potency have been published. The most recent study, involving house dust mite allergic asthmatics, failed to confirm a therapeutic improvement at the end of the study, but did provide preliminary evidence for an oscillation in outcome (both physiological and subjective) in with verum treatment to placebo. In this paper we show how such an oscillation is consistent with a complexity theory interpretation of how the body functions as a whole, and speculate on why different studies have produced different results. If the complexity theory interpretation is correct, then this will have a significant impact on the design of clinical trials in homeopathy and, possibly, other complementary medical interventions. "
"This prospective observational pilot study investigated the effect of individualized homeopathy on male infertility based on sperm count, hormone values and general health. Forty-five subfertile men were treated with single homeopathic remedies for an average of 10.3 months. The drugs were prescribed on the basis of the overall symptomatic situation. The variables ‘sperm density’, ‘percentage of sperm with good progressive motility’ and ‘density of sperm with good propulsive motility’ improved significantly, especially in cases of oligoasthenozoospermia. The general health of patients improved significantly. The following factors emerged as positive predictors of therapy success: alcohol consumption below 30 g/day, non-smoking, the presence of less than five dental amalgam fillings, no exposure to noxious substances at the workplace and no previous inflammatory genital diseases. The factors stress, age above 36, high coffee consumption and long duration of unwanted childlessness did not have a negative impact on therapy outcome in this study. The rate of improvement in sperm count through homeopathic therapy is comparable to the improvement achieved by conventional therapy, so that individualized-homeopathic treatment may be considered a useful alternative to conventional treatment of subfertile men. For further investigation, a randomised, therapy-controlled clinical study with parallel group design would be useful (homeopathic therapy vs conventional andrological therapy). vs vs "
"This study examined associations between scores for 19 different remedies on the constitutional type questionnaire (CTQ) and scores on standardized psychological and medical trait and state scales from health psychology research. Subjects were 104 young adult American college students (mean age 20 years; 67% female). Scales included the chemical intolerance index (CII) for environmental sensitivity, the NEO personality inventory, Marlowe–Crowne social desirability (MCSD) Scale for defensiveness, Harvard parental caring scale (HPCS) for perceived mother and father traits, Profile of Mood State (POMS) scale, Pennebaker symptom checklist (PSC), and a 3-item global health rating scale. The majority of CTQ constitutional type scores correlated significantly with greater NEO neuroticism, lower MCSD defensiveness, and greater psychological distress on the POMS subscales. NEO Extraversion and Openness subscales correlated with specific CTQ scores in directions consistent with clinical remedy pictures. CTQ Carcinosin differed from other remedies, showing no significant correlations with other scales. As hypothesized (a) persons high on CTQ scores for Carcinosin and low in parental caring (HPCS) had the highest symptom score; (b) those high on CTQ scores for Sulphur and low on HPCS had the poorest global health ratings; (c) individuals high on four different CTQ type scores (Carcinosin, Lachesis, Nux vomica, Sulphur) and high on environmental sensitivity (CII) exhibited the highest symptom scores. Taken together, the data offer additional validation of the CTQ and provide a foundation for studying interactions of constitutional type with both psychosocial and physicochemical environmental factors in homeopathic provers and patients.

"Hot flushes are a common problem, especially for menopausal women for whom hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is contra-indicated or who prefer not to take it and patients receiving Tamoxifen. Some seek homeopathic treatment. We report an uncontrolled, pilot outcome study, conducted at the Tunbridge Wells Homeopathic Hospital (TWHH) in 1998–1999. The study was conducted in out-patient consultations booked in the usual way. Thirty-one patients referred to the Department for menopausal flushes and seen for an initial consultation and at least one follow-up review, were assessed in three groups: •Hot flushes: No history of carcinoma of the breast.•Hot flushes: Treatment for breast carcinoma, not receiving Tamoxifen.•Hot flushes: Treatment for breast cancer including Tamoxifen. • Hot flushes: No history of carcinoma of the breast. Hot flushes: No history of carcinoma of the breast. • Hot flushes: Treatment for breast carcinoma, not receiving Tamoxifen. Hot flushes: Treatment for breast carcinoma, not receiving Tamoxifen. • Hot flushes: Treatment for breast cancer including Tamoxifen. Hot flushes: Treatment for breast cancer including Tamoxifen. For all patients, the initial and follow-up assessments included review of hot flush frequency and severity. Patients also completed their own self-assessment rating after follow-up consultations. The results indicate useful symptomatic benefit for all three groups of patients. • Hot flushes: No history of carcinoma of the breast. Hot flushes: No history of carcinoma of the breast. • Hot flushes: Treatment for breast carcinoma, not receiving Tamoxifen.

"The effects of Coffea cruda 30 and 200c and caffeine on the sleep pattern of rats were investigated. Treatments were administered orally at the beginning of the sleeping period. EEG from the parietal region was recorded. Delta (0.5–2.5 Hz) and slow (<1 Hz) waves are two of the major oscillation types that characterize neocortical electrical activity. The spectral power in these bands and the power ratio between 0.32–0.48 Hz and the delta band (slow/delta power ratio) for control and treatment groups were analyzed blind. Power in the delta band was significantly higher than baseline for Coffea 30c and caffeine (15.5 mg/kg). An increase in the slow/delta power ratio between control and treatment was detected for Coffea cruda 30 and 200c. Coffea 30c and caffeine have similar effects on sleep pattern, enhancing delta power; Coffea cruda 200c appears to affect only the synchronization.

Vital Force is a concept that has suffered at the hands of the current medical model. An attempt is made to show how it might be possible to explain Vital Force in terms of complexity theory. A metaphor is introduced for the operation of Vital Force in terms of gyroscopic motion. 
"The objective of this review was to ascertain the incidence of childhood sexual abuse: to ascertain the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse and to collate the experiences of homeopaths in caring for survivors. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is common with a high percentage of homeopathic patients giving a positive history. It is associated with many common clinical conditions, particularly pelvic pain. Survivors are more likely to present for medical help and to be hospitalised. Homeopaths have found work with such patients to be difficult, with cases being complex and multi-layered. New models for case-analysis have been developed. "
"Two hundred homeopathic practitioners were each sent a questionnaire. The main body of the questionnaire requested the analysis of a paper case, with an optional second case. The response rate was disappointing at about 15%. There was consensus of 33% for the selection of the correct medicine in the analysis of the first case. The study was small but poses further questions about case analysis and the diverse interpretations of the law of similars. "
"The issues which have dominated discussion of homeopathic medicine hitherto are the efficacy and effectiveness of the medicines themselves and the problem of their mechanism of action. The resolution of these is of profound clinical and scientific importance. But there is another aspect of homeopathic methodology that is of equal, and perhaps even more fundamental importance, and that does not depend on whether or how the medicines work. This is the detailed study, almost unique now in western medicine, of the disease process and the healing process; the evolution, manifestation and resolution of the illness in the individual patient. This paper reviews the epidemiology and the ‘pathography’ that are inherent in the homeopathic method, and discusses their implications for medical science and clinical practice, and their value to medical education; their importance to the identity of the medicine of the future and the doctor of the future. "
"A pilot survey of 1025 patients receiving homeopathic treatment in six European countries is reported. An initial questionnaire included demographic information and questions from health-related Quality of Life (QoL) scales. A follow-up questionnaire collected data on changes in QoL. The demographic characteristics of respondents were similar to previous studies. 82.8% of respondents had previously tried conventional treatments. Satisfaction with consultations was high. The changes of QoL status are positive but weak. 2.7% of patients experienced side-effects which they attribute to homeopathic treatment. 7.8% of patients reported significant aggravation at the beginning of the homeopathic treatment, 25.4% slight aggravation of symptoms. A new survey should be performed with a better motivation of doctors and patients. Further description of treatment would be helpful. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between skin surface temperature and pressure pain tolerance thresholds (PPTs) of asymptomatic individuals exposed to cryotherapy and thermotherapy. Methods Twenty-two asymptomatic female university students aged between 18 and 35 years underwent thermography and algometry assessments at 6 points in both knees before, immediately after, and 20 minutes after the application of frozen (cryotherapy) or heated (thermotherapy) gel bags in the right knee for 20 minutes. Data were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance, Student t test, and Pearson or Spearman correlation tests. t t Results There was a significant change in skin surface temperature after cryotherapy and thermotherapy, which was maintained after 20 minutes of withdrawal (P < .001). After the intervention, no significant differences were observed regarding PPT compared with the baseline measurements, nor between the experimental and control knees. P P Conclusion Cryotherapy and thermotherapy produced significant changes in the temperature of the evaluated points after their application. No differences in pain tolerance were observed in these asymptomatic participants. There was little association between skin surface temperature and PPT in the knees of healthy women after application of the resources. "
"Objective This study aimed to assess the intraexaminer and interexaminer reproducibility of the Downing test in sacroiliac joint evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Methods A reliability study was conducted with a test–retest design in 54 college students of both sexes. To assess the intraexaminer reproducibility, each participant was evaluated twice by the same examiner with a 7-day interval, and to assess the interexaminer reproducibility, each participant was evaluated by 2 examiners. Results Of the 54 participants included in the study, 18 (33.3%) were asymptomatic and 36 (66.7%) were symptomatic; a total of 108 sacroiliac joints were evaluated. Sacroiliac joint diagnosis based on the Downing test presented low intraexaminer reproducibility in all participants (κ = 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.22), in asymptomatic individuals (κ = 0.18, 95% CI 0.02-0.34), and in symptomatic individuals (κ = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.39). The interexaminer reproducibility also was low in all participants (κ = 0.18, 95% CI 0.09-0.27), in asymptomatic individuals (κ = 0.22, 95% CI 0.15-0.37), and in symptomatic individuals (κ = 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.27). The standard error of the measurement values were not lower than smallest detectable change values considering a CI of 95% for all participants. Conclusion For this group of asymptomatic and symptomatic participants, the reproducibility of the Downing test was poor. The clinical utility of this test used in isolation is not supported by the present study. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a complex versus a contrast training regimen with steroid hormones and the performance of soccer players. Methods Thirty-six professional male soccer players were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: complex training (n = 12; body mass index [BMI], 22.95 ± 1.76 kg/m2), contrast training (n = 12; BMI, 22.05 ± 2.03 kg/m2), and control (n = 12; BMI, 22.27 ± 1.44 kg/m2). Players from the complex and contrast groups were trained for 6 weeks (3 d/wk). The complex group performed 4 different exercises, each composed of strength (80% of 1 repetition maximum [RM]) and power components alternately. The contrast group performed the same strengthening exercises alternately at different intensities (40% and 80% of 1 RM). All players were tested for free testosterone, cortisol, vertical jump, 20-m sprint, and agility T-test at the baseline and after 6 weeks of training. 2 2 2 2 2 2 Results A 3 × 2 mixed analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in time effect (P ≤ .05), whereas a nonsignificant difference was found in the group effect for all outcome variables. group × time interaction was significant in all the variables (P < .01) except cortisol (P = .28). P P P P P P Conclusion Complex training showed greater improvement in physical performance and free testosterone concentration compared with contrast training, whereas both types of training decreased cortisol concentration in a similar fashion.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate how the hip, knee, and ankle moments in the sagittal plane contribute to the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) in healthy participants during normal speed of walking. Methods Forty healthy male individuals volunteered to participate in this study. They were filmed using 6 high-speed (120 Hz) Pro-Reflex infrared cameras (Qualisys) while walking on an Advanced Mechanical Technology Incorporation force platform. The data collected were the percentage contribution of the moments of the hip, knee, and ankle joints in the sagittal plane at the instant of occurrence of the first peak, second peak, and trough of the vertical GRF. Results The results revealed that at the first peak of the GRF (loading response), the highest contribution was generated from the knee extension moment followed by the hip extension moment. Knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion moments produced a high contribution to the trough of the GRF (midstance) with approximately equal values. The second peak of the GRF was mainly produced by the ankle plantar flexion moment. Conclusion The role of hip extension moment is secondary to knee extension moment in the first peak of GRF. Knee flexion moment is secondary to ankle plantar flexion moment in the second peak of GRF. Both knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion moments have equal contribution during midstance. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to generate data for conduction of a power analysis to investigate short-term effects of visceral manipulation associated with conventional physical therapy on pain intensity, lumbar mobility, and functionality of people with chronic low back pain and visceral dysfunctions. Methods This was a double-blinded, randomized, controlled, clinical trial preliminary study. A blinded evaluation was conducted involving 20 people with chronic low back pain with visceral dysfunction. Pain perception, lumbar mobility, and functionality were assessed in 3 moments: evaluation 1 (1 week before the intervention), evaluation 2 (immediately after the last intervention), and evaluation 3 (1 week after the last intervention). The protocol consisted of 50-minute session of conventional physical therapy and visceral manipulation. The participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: 10 for the experimental group (conventional physical therapy and visceral manipulation) and 10 for the control group (conventional physical therapy and placebo visceral manipulation). Results Significant reductions were found in the experimental group for lumbar mobility and specific functionality in comparison with the control group (P < .05). There were no significant differences for pain perception and global functionality. P P Conclusion The combination of visceral manipulation and conventional physical therapy program demonstrated significant between-groups differences over time for lumbar spine mobility and specific functionality. These gains occurred after 5 sessions, once a week, and were maintained 1 week after the end of the treatment. This study generated data for conduction of a power analysis to inform the design for future clinical research in this line of inquiry. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of prolonged vibratory stimulus on the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force and muscle activity of the triceps brachii and to clarify the effective stimulus time. Methods Twenty-five healthy volunteers with a mean age of 21.4 years participated. A vibratory stimulus at 86 Hz was applied to the triceps brachii tendon for 5 and 10 minutes. Before and after these stimuli, the elbow extension MVC force was measured using a handheld dynamometer. Muscle activities of the lateral, long, and medial heads of the triceps brachii were also recorded by surface electromyography. Results The median MVC force significantly decreased to 82.7% after 5 minutes of vibratory stimulus and to 83.3% after 10 minutes of vibratory stimulus (P < .001). The median percentage of integrated electromyography of the triceps also significantly decreased to 78.2 (lateral head), 83.8 (long head), and 81.5 (medial head) after 5 minutes of vibratory stimulus and to 77.7, 81.4, and 77.2, respectively, after 10 minutes of vibratory stimulus (P < .001). There were no differences in the decrease in the MVC force and median percentage of integrated electromyography between 5 and 10 minutes of vibratory stimulus (P > .05). P P P P P P Conclusion Prolonged vibratory stimulus (5 minutes) to the triceps brachii tendon appeared to have an inhibitory effect on MVC force and muscle activity. The present results suggest that prolonged vibratory stimulus could be an effective treatment capable of reducing muscle tonus of the triceps brachii. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt to Brazilian Portuguese, and analyze the measurement properties of the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure and investigate whether empathy can be a predictor of clinical improvement. Methods This psychometric study was divided into 2 stages: the cross-cultural adaptation process included 30 patients, and the evaluation of the measurement properties included 106 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. After the third therapy session with the same physical therapist, the following questionnaires were applied to assess internal consistency, construct validity, and ceiling and floor effects: Pain Numerical Rating Scale, Brazilian Portuguese version of the CARE Measure (CARE-Br), MedRisk Instrument for Measuring Patient Satisfaction with Physical Therapy Care, and Global Perceived Effect Scale. To assess reliability and measurement error, the CARE-Br was answered 48 hours later. For prediction analysis of the CARE-Br in relation to clinical improvement, the participants answered the Pain Numerical Rating Scale and Global Perceived Effect Scale 2 months after baseline. Results The internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach’s ɑ = 0.88), reliability was substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.77), measurement error was good (standard error of the measurement = 5.16%), and a moderate correlation was found with the MedRisk Instrument for Measuring Patient Satisfaction with Physical Therapy Care (r = 0.50). A ceiling effect was also found (39.6% of participants). Empathy was not considered a predictor of clinical improvement. r r Conclusion The Brazilian Portuguese version of the CARE Measure is reliable, adequate, and applicable in clinical settings and research in Brazil. However, it is not capable of predicting clinical improvement in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to review the potential effects of traditional Chinese medicine—which includes acupuncture; electroacupuncture; plum blossom needle hammer; auricular acupuncture; herbs that balance hormones, regulate neurotransmitters, induce sedative effects, and increase thermogenesis; and functional foods that can suppress the appetite—as an adjunct therapy for weight loss. Methods A narrative review of the current literature was performed using searches of MEDLINE and 4 scholarly texts. The inclusion criteria for the review consisted of studies that were performed from 2005 to 2016. Results In general, some traditional Chinese medicine modalities claim to promote weight loss. Acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and herbs aim to reduce stress-related food cravings. These therapeutic approaches aim to downregulate dopamine and leptin levels, suppressing the appetite. Other attributes of these therapies are increasing uncoupling protein-1 activity promoting thermogenesis, which contributes to weight loss. In addition, acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and Cimicifuga racemosa may regulate estrogen, which could attenuate the appetite, assisting in weight-loss programs. Cimicifuga racemosa Cimicifuga racemosa Conclusion The literature reviewed includes information that describes how traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, or functional foods as adjunct therapies may be beneficial for weight-loss programs.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the isokinetic strength of hip muscles in dominant vs nondominant legs in healthy adults. Methods Thirty-two healthy college students (15 male and 17 female) volunteered to participate in this study. A Biodex system 3 was used to measure isokinetic peak torque at an angular velocity of 60°/s for the hip flexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors in both dominant and nondominant legs. Hip flexors and extensors were tested from the supine lying position while hip abductors and adductors were tested from the side lying position using concentric mode of muscle contraction. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the dominant and nondominant sides for all tested hip muscles. Conclusion Leg dominance does not appear to affect hip muscle strength in healthy adults. This may be used as normative data for those with differences in muscle strength between involved and uninvolved sides. "
Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in reported gross billings and collections between doctors of chiropractic who have obtained a certificate of additional qualification (CAQ) in sports medicine compared with those without a CAQ in sports medicine. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. An e-mail invitation to participate in an anonymous survey was sent to doctors of chiropractic who hold active certifications with the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians. The respondents were provided a link to a web-based survey that was constructed with similar questions to a national chiropractic survey issued by Chiropractic Economics (CE) for the same year (2015). Chiropractic Economics Chiropractic Economics Results Three hundred forty-nine sports medicine CAQ doctors of chiropractic responded (23.8% response rate) in comparison to 719 CE respondents. The CAQ respondents averaged $722 983 in gross billings (9.8% response rate) compared with $539 046 by CE respondents. Sports medicine CAQ doctors of chiropractic averaged $452 376 in gross collections (10.4% response rate) compared with $348 773 by CE respondents. Conclusion An analysis of these 2 surveys illustrates that CAQ respondents report higher total annual gross billings and collections than the CE respondents. Improving study methodology may improve response rates and garner a more accurate representation of any differences between doctors of chiropractic with and without CAQs. 
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of preterm infant massage by the mother on the mood state of mothers of preterm infants. Methods This experimental study assessed 52 mothers of preterm infants (born at 30-37 weeks of gestation) hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of Afzalipour Hospital of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Recruitment was done using the convenience sampling method, and participants were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, massage therapy was done once a day for 5 consecutive days. Infants in the control group received the usual care. Data were collected using a questionnaire of demographic information and the Profile of Mood State questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 19 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York) and Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, and χ2 tests. 2 2 Results Comparison of the mothers’ mean mood scores between the intervention and control groups showed no significant difference before the intervention (P = .51), whereas mean scores differed significantly after the intervention between the groups (P = .005). Mothers’ mean mood scores improved significantly in the control group (P = .02) and the intervention group (P < .001), whereas the intervention group showed a greater improvement (-4.155 vs -2.238). P P P P P P P P Conclusion Those mothers performing massage on their preterm infants showed greater improvement in their mood compared with those in the control group. Teaching massage to the mothers of these infants could be considered as a possible intervention to enhance a mother’s mood and the quality of care she provides to her infant. "
"Objective The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of different rates of thoracic spine passive accessory intervertebral mobilization (PAIVM) on pressure pain threshold (PPT) at T4. The secondary aim was to investigate the widespread effects of different rates of thoracic PAIVM. Methods Twenty asymptomatic participants were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions: posteroanterior rotatory thoracic PAIVM at 2 Hz, 0.5 Hz, and placebo. Each participant received all 3 experimental conditions in a random order with a washout period of at least 48 hours between each procedure. The PPT was measured in 3 different points: pre-treatment, immediately after, and 15 minutes after the treatment at C7 and T4 spinous process, first interossei dorsal on the right and left hands and tibial tuberosity bilaterally. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance adjusted by baseline values was used to assess between-group differences at each point. Pairwise comparisons were adjusted for multiple tests with a Bonferroni correction. A P value < .05 was considered significant. P P Results There was no between-group differences on PPT at T4 when comparing 0.5 Hz (mean difference -0.29; 95% CI -0.99 to 0.42; P = .999) or 2 Hz (mean difference -0.37; 95% CI -1.1 to 0.33; P = .528) to placebo. P P P P Conclusion None of the mobilization techniques in this study (0.5 Hz, 2 Hz, and placebo) showed a significant change of PPT both locally and at distant sites at any point in asymptomatic participants.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of thoracic spinal manipulation (SM) on shoulder pain and ranges of motion in individuals with shoulder pain. Methods The sample was composed of 60 individuals, randomly allocated into the manipulation group (n = 30), who received the SM, and the placebo group (n = 30) who received a placebo manipulation. Pain evaluation was performed using the visual analog scale, and evaluation of shoulder flexion and abduction ranges of motion was assessed using a goniometer pre- and post-intervention. The intervention was performed by either upper thoracic SM or a placebo manipulation. Results The manipulation group demonstrated increased flexion and abduction of the painful shoulder (P < .01) and increased abduction of the nonpainful shoulder (P = .03), but only the abduction of the painful shoulder reached the minimal detectable change. The placebo group showed a post-intervention increase in the flexion (P = .03) and abduction (P < .01) movement of the painful shoulder. Both groups presented a statistically significant reduction in post-intervention pain (P < .01), but not clinically significant. P P P P P P P P P P Conclusion Although the SM demonstrated a statistically significant difference for shoulder pain, this was not over the clinically meaningful change. Only the abduction of the painful shoulder reached the minimal detectable change. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of core neuromuscular training on pain, balance, and performance in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Methods This randomized single-blind trial was based on a convenience sample of 28 women with unilateral PFPS. All participants were assigned randomly to the intervention or control group with a block randomization method. The control group received routine physical therapy exercise for PFPS. The intervention group received core neuromuscular training in addition to routine physical therapy exercise. The outcome measures evaluated were pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale), function (Kujala patellofemoral questionnaire and step-down performance test), and balance (Y balance test). Results In both groups the pain score was significantly lower after treatment (P = .001). The slope of this trend was greater in the intervention group. The Kujala and step-down scores improved significantly after treatment in both groups, although the improvements were greater in the intervention group. The Y balance score improved in all 3 directions after therapy in both groups (P < .05); improvement was significantly greater in the intervention group only in the posteromedial direction (P = .016). P P P P P P Conclusion For the group of participants studied, a 4-week core neuromuscular training plus routine physiotherapy exercise was more effective than routine physiotherapy exercise alone for improving pain, balance, and functional performance in individuals with PFPS.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of neuromuscular training (NMT) and quadriceps training (QT) on the altered gait patterns and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and varus malalignment. Methods Sixty-six patients with knee pain ≥2 on 100-mm visual analog scale, radiographic knee OA changes ≥2 on Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale, and genu varum were allocated randomly into either the neuromuscular training group or quadriceps training group. Twelve weeks of supervised exercise protocol was given to the participants of both groups, which included 3 sessions per week. Primary outcomes were gait variables and self-reported physical function (WOMAC index). Results Of 66 knee OA patients, only 31 (94%) in the NMT group and 28 (84.8%) in the QT group completed the exercise protocol and were included in the analysis. There was a significant improvement in gait velocity (P = .022), stride length (P = .009), and global WOMAC index (P = .011) in the NMT group compared to the QT group. However, the scores of cadence (P = .226), gait cycle (P = .332), and double limb support (P = .054) were not found significant in the NMT group compared with the QT group. P P = P P P P P P = P P P P Conclusion The NMT group showed improvement in some of the gait parameters as well as improvement in pain, stiffness, and functional limitation compared with conventional QT. No additional improvement was found in cadence, gait cycle, and double limb support in patients who received NMT. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the electromyographic activity of lumbar multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES) muscle during forward walking (FW) and backward walking (BW) in participants with and without chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods Twenty-one patients with CLBP were recruited from outpatient department of Centre for Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia. Twenty-one age-matched healthy controls without CLBP were recruited from community. Maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was quantified for MF and ES using standard guidelines. Electromyographic activity of MF and ES was recorded using surface electrodes during FW and BW on a motorized treadmill, which was later normalized by respective MVIC’s of each muscle. Results Muscle activity (in percentage MVIC) was determined to be higher for both the muscles during BW. Activity of MF muscle was significantly higher in CLBP patients compared with healthy controls (P < .04). Electromyographic activity of MF and ES was significantly increased during BW (MF: P < .001; ES: P < .001) compared with FW in both healthy and CLBP groups. P P P P P P Conclusion BW leads to greater activation of the paraspinal muscles. Along with global extensor (ES), activity of core extensor (MF) is also higher during BW than FW in both healthy participants and CLBP patients. BW is a more favorable aerobic activity to enhance lumbar paraspinal recruitment. These findings may have important clinical implications in the rehabilitation of CLBP. "

"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of scapulothoracic (ST) mobilization plus physical therapy (PT) with PT alone in patients with mechanical neck pain. Methods This double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted at Shiraz School of Rehabilitation Sciences and involved 46 patients with mechanical neck pain and scapular dyskinesia. The patients were randomly assigned to the ST mobilization + PT group (scapulothoracic mobilization and physical therapy) or the PT group (physical therapy treatment) by a computer-generated randomized table of numbers. Both groups received 5 sessions of treatment during 1 week. Pain intensity and grip strength were evaluated 3 times: baseline, after the first session, and after the fifth session. Furthermore, functional disability of the upper limbs and the neck were evaluated before and at the fifth session. Results The results showed that the pain intensity was reduced and grip strength increased significantly after the first session (P = .01) and at the end of the treatment (P = .01) in the ST mobilization + PT group in comparison with the PT group. Also, the mean difference of upper limb (P = .01) and neck disability (P = .02) decreased significantly in the ST mobilization + PT group in comparison with the PT group. P P P P P P P P Conclusion Scapulothoracic mobilization in combination with physical therapy may be superior to physical therapy alone in reducing pain intensity, maximizing grip strength, and reducing upper limb and neck disability in mechanical neck pain.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the skin pressure needed to promote the macroscopic deformation of the asymptomatic patellar tendon and to verify if the pressure is associated with the individual’s characteristics. Methods A descriptive laboratory study was performed with a convenience sample of 18 young, voluntary, and asymptomatic individuals of both sexes. A progressively increasing pressure was applied on the skin over the patellar tendon, through an instrument designed to perform and control the pressure upon an ultrasound probe; data were recorded and analyzed by 2 blind investigators. All statistical analyses were conducted considering α = 0.05. Results The average pressure needed to promote a macroscopic deformation of the patellar tendon was 1.12 ± 0.37 kg/cm2. Female sex and age were inversely but not significantly associated with the pressure performed. Sports practice, weight, height, body mass index, muscle mass, and subcutaneous thickness were positively but not significantly associated with the pressure executed. 2 2 Conclusion The average pressure needed to promote the macroscopic deformation of the patellar tendon was 1.12 ± 0.37 kg/cm2, which was not influenced by the characteristics of the participants. 2 2 "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to develop and verify a quantifiable symmetry score for infantile postural and movement asymmetries. Methods Three studies were conducted. For reliability, 6 test items examining postural and movement asymmetries, which came under consideration, were investigated in 24 infants with postural abnormality (range: 14-24 weeks). The inter-rater reliability was chosen as the primary endpoint. Furthermore, intrarater reliability and test-retest reliability were determined. Analysis and weighting of the items were performed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. The validity was reviewed by expert opinion and by using a study with 26 infants (range: 12-28 weeks) of a cross-section population. The pilot study involved 38 infants, aged 14 to 24 weeks, who were examined using video. Their autonomic symptoms were recorded, and subsequently, they were treated once by means of manual medicine. The parents were instructed to a daily home program that focused on “tummy time.” Results The reliability tests led to a 4-item symmetry score with a point value between 4 points (very symmetrical) and 17 points (very asymmetrical). The chosen items achieved an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8 and Cohen’s κ >0.6, respectively. The experts’ opinions matched mainly to a majority agreement (>50%). Furthermore, a comparison between the outcome of clinical testing and the symmetry score applied to 26 children without diagnosed abnormalities displayed an agreement of 84.6%. The pilot study showed a good reduction of the postural and movement abnormalities because 63% of the manual treated children were assessed as being symmetric afterward. Conclusion The reliable and valid 4-item symmetry score served for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of infants aged 3 to 6 months with infantile postural and movement asymmetries. The results of a pilot study showed the positive effect of a single manual medical treatment session along with a home program focusing on “tummy time.” "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to develop and measure a protocol for evaluation of cervical range of motion (ROM), based on passive mobilization (PM) combined with active mobilization (AM) and recorded through an optical motion capture system. Methods Passive and active mobilization were applied to 24 asymptomatic participants. Cervical ROM was recorded in 3 anatomic planes (transversal, frontal, and sagittal) using a precision optical system and a set of rigid bodies placed on the sacrum, spinous processes of the C7-T1 vertebrae, and the head. Three captures were made for each participant, distributed over 2 days. The characteristics of the PM, the interaction with the AM, and the coherence patterns between tests were analyzed. Reliability was studied for these procedures. Results The reliability results of the PM were high in all analyzed indices; only flexion showed low values. Reliability of AM was greater than PM for flexion, extension, and lateralization because of the similarity to rotation. No statistically significant differences were found comparing PM and AM techniques. Conclusion The authors present a cervical ROM assessment based on combined PM and AM protocols at different sessions. This model demonstrated high reliability, individually and combined, and no differences were detected between PM and AM ROMs. Because the evaluator, instrumentation, and the patient are factors that could influence outcomes, the authors suggest that they be combined in protocols. These protocols could be used to evaluate the functional and structural capacity of patients and inform clinical outcomes. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess correlation between variables of upper body balance, muscular strength, and power in cricketers belonging to different age groups. Methods Forty-eight healthy male cricketers (26 adolescents aged 14-17 years and 22 adults aged 18-25 years) were recruited from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India. After a warm-up, the participants underwent Upper Quarter Y Balance Test, backward overhead medicine ball throw test, and back-strength testing in a random order. Results Values of the Pearson correlation coefficient for muscle strength and upper body power were found to be 0.397 and 0.499 for adolescent and adult cricketers, respectively. Correlation coefficient values for upper body balance and strength range from -0.008 to 0.05 and 0.325 to 0.414 and for upper body balance and power range from 0.059 to 0.062 and 0.133 to 0.153 for adolescent and adult cricketers, respectively. Conclusion Statistically significant, moderate-sized correlations were demonstrated between muscular strength and upper body power in adolescent and adult cricketers. However, no correlations existed between upper body balance and power and upper body balance and muscular strength in these athletes. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to determine the intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability of electromyographic assessment of biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB) muscles in cricketers. Methods Sixteen healthy male cricketers (ages 14-35 years) recruited from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India were tested on 2 occasions that were held 1 week apart. On the first occasion, only examiner 1 performed the testing; on the second occasion, examiner 1, examiner 2, and examiner 3 all performed testing. While testing for surface electromyography (sEMG) activity of BB and TB muscles, participants were asked to produce maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), which was to be held for 5 seconds against the resistance provided by an examiner. Participants performed 3 MVICs per muscle per examiner, with a rest interval of 3 minutes between consecutive contractions. Intraclass correlation coefficient, standard error of measurement, and minimum detectable change were calculated to determine the reliability of repeated sEMG measurements. Results Nonsignificant differences were observed for the 2 trials completed by examiner 1 (paired t test) and testing done by all 3 examiners (repeated measures analysis of variance) at P < .05 for both BB and TB. Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged from .84 to .86 for BB and .89 to .98 for TB. Standard error of measurement (minimum detectable change) was .052 (.144) mV and .041 (.114) mV for BB intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability testing, respectively, and .018 (.051) mV and .043 (.119) mV for TB intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability testing. Ninety-five percent of the mean differences between almost all of the repeated measurements were found to lie within the agreement intervals estimated by Bland-Altman plots. t P t P Conclusion This preliminary study suggests that sEMG is a reliable tool with excellent intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability for assessing the activity of BB and TB muscles in male cricketers. These findings suggest that sEMG can be used to assess MVIC activity of these muscles in clinical settings, as well as in research area. "
"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of spinal manipulation (SM) on wrist muscle spasticity and manual dexterity in participants with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods After baseline examination, 78 participants with spastic CP (7-18 years) without contractures or hyperkinetic syndrome were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The experimental group underwent SM to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, and the control group received sham SM. A second evaluation was performed 5 minutes postintervention. Wrist muscle spasticity was measured quantitatively with NeuroFlexor (Aggero MedTech AB, Solna, Sweden), a device assessing resistance to passive movements of different velocities. Between-group difference was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Manual dexterity was evaluated by the Box and Block test. Results In the experimental group, muscle spasticity was reduced by 2.18 newton from median 5.53 with interquartile range 8.66 to median 3.35 newton with interquartile range 7.19; the difference was statistically significant (P = .002). In the control group, reduction in spasticity was negligible. The between-group difference in change of muscle spasticity was statistically significant (P = .034). Improvement of manual dexterity was not statistically significant (P = .28). P P P P P P Conclusions These findings suggest that SM may, in the short term, help to reduce spasticity in participants with CP. Long-term effects of SM on muscle spasticity have yet to be studied.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of foot reflexology on capillary blood glucose, feet tissue temperature, and plantar pressure of the feet of individuals with diabetes mellitus (type 2). Methods Forty-five individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were stratified into 2 groups: treated (n = 21), which received orientation about foot self-care and received 12 foot reflexology sessions; and control (n = 24), which received only orientations about foot self-care. A portable glucose meter, an infrared thermography camera, and a baropodometer evaluated the variables. Results The data indicate that, after 12 therapy sessions, there were no significant differences between the groups for producing effects on capillary blood glucose, feet tissue temperature, and plantar pressure. Conclusion No significant effect was observed after 12 foot reflexology sessions in the variables that were evaluated. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to review previously published meta-analyses on the effectiveness of dietary fiber on reducing the incidence of cancer. Methods An umbrella review of all published meta-analyses was performed. A PubMed search from January 1, 1980 to June 30, 2017 was conducted using the following search strategy: (fiber OR fibre) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review) AND (cancer OR carcinoma). Only English-language publications that provided quantitative statistical analysis on cancer were retrieved. Results Nineteen meta-analyses comparing highest vs lowest dietary fiber intake were retrieved for inclusion in this umbrella review. There was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk (RR) of colorectal, esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer (RR = 0.52-0.88); however, statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. There was a statistically significant reduction in the RR of breast cancer (RR = 0.85-0.93). Conclusion This review suggests that those consuming the highest amounts of dietary fiber may benefit from a reduction in the incidence of developing colorectal cancer, and there also appears to be a small reduction in the incidence of breast cancer.

"Objective The purpose of this paper was to review the literature regarding the mechanisms leading to degeneration in intervertebral disks and to discuss contributing mechanical and biological factors. Methods The inclusion criteria for the literature review were research studies conducted in the last 3 decades with free full-text available in English. Review articles and articles pertaining to temporomandibular joints and joints of the body other than the intervertebral disk were excluded. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar through September 9, 2016. Results A total of 57 articles were used in this review. Intervertebral disk cells require glucose for sustainability and oxygen to synthesize matrix components. Nutrients enter the disk via 2 vascular supply routes: capillary beds of end plates and the peripheral annulus fibrosus. Solute size, shape and charge, compression, and metabolic demand all influence the efficiency of nutrient transport, and alterations of any of these factors may have effects on nutrient transport and, potentially, disk degeneration. Conclusions Progressive nutrient transport disruptions may actively contribute in advancing the phases of degenerative disk disease. Such disruptions include dysfunctional loading and spinal position, lack of motion, high frequency loading, disk injury, aging, smoking, an acidic environment, and a lack of nutrient bioavailability.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of self-reported history of physician-diagnosed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) among chiropractic students and any association with infection control behaviors (hand and table hygiene, sharing gowns, and sharing lotion) and initiation of patient care. Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus Methods Questionnaires were obtained from 312 students attending half (9/18) of US chiropractic campuses. The questionnaire was derived from earlier studies led by Bearman in 2010 and Evans in 2007. Associations were assessed with Fisher exact test. Crude odds ratios were calculated for each of the variables. Two logistic regression models were produced. Results Attendance at 1 campus was associated with postmatriculation MRSA SSTI in univariate analysis (P = .010). The logistic regression model was significant (P < .05), but the composing variables were not. P P P P Conclusions Fewer than 5 cases of MRSA SSTI were detected overall, revealing a low rate of reported postmatriculation MRSA SSTI among these students. There was a univariate association with postmatriculation MRSA SSTI at 1 chiropractic college. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of thoracic spinal manipulation (SM) on autonomic modulation and heart rate in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Methods The design of the study was quasi-experimental. Participants were divided into 3 study groups: the asymptomatic group (n = 30), which received SM; the tendinitis group (TG, n = 30), which received SM; and the placebo group (PG, n = 30), which received placebo manipulation. Heart rate variability was analyzed with an electrocardiogram before and after intervention. For intragroup analysis, the paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare the means (pre vs post) of sex and age divided into 5 age groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test was employed for analysis between the groups, and a significance level of 5% was adopted. Results The TG demonstrated an increase in respiratory rate (mean of the selected intervals corresponding to parasympathetic activity) post intervention for both sexes (P = .04). Heart rate exhibited reduction post intervention in women in the TG (P = .05). The PG demonstrated an increase in respiratory rate post intervention for both sexes (female P = .01; male P = .02). In the age groups, only the PG presented any difference in the 40- to 50-year and 50- to 60-year age groups (P = .03) for the same variable. Heart rate exhibited a reduction post intervention in women in the PG (P = .01) and a reduction in the 50- to 60-year age group (P = .04). No difference in the studied variables was observed in the asymptomatic group, and there were no differences among the groups.

"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a motion palpation procedure, the flexion-extension test, in localizing the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra (C7). Methods We analyzed 101 adult participants with metal markers that permitted the identification of the C7 spinous process. This analysis occurred during a flexion-extension test and was confirmed by radiography. Data sample characteristics were analyzed by descriptive statistics, and the relationship between independent variables (weight, height, sex, age, and body mass index [BMI]) and dependent variables (coincidence between the most prominent vertebra and the stationary vertebra, as determined by the flexion-extension test) was determined via logistic regression. Results The sample population was 48.5% male with a mean age of 56.8 years (standard deviation, ±14.9) and a mean BMI of 25.54 kg/m2 (standard deviation, ±5.5). In 54.5% of cases, the C7 spinous process was correctly identified by the flexion-extension test. The agreement between the flexion-extension test and radiography in accuracy of localization of the C7 spinous process was significant (P = .021), as was the correct localization of C7 (P = .05). 2 P P 2 P P Conclusion The localization of the C7 spinous process was more accurate in individuals with a BMI <25 kg/m2 and whose most prominent vertebra coincided with the stationary vertebra as determined by the flexion-extension test. 2 2 "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe an exercise intervention for an elderly patient with Parkinson disease with a chief complaint of lower back pain. Clinical Features The patient was an 85-year-old man who had been diagnosed with Parkinson disease and kyphosis. Back pain was preventing him from carrying out activities of daily living. He was referred for physical therapy for treatment to reduce lower back pain and increase function. An initial examination consisted of testing flexibility and range of motion and administering a pain severity scale and a Lower Extremity Functional Index (LEFI); the patient’s initial LEFI score was 14/80. Intervention and Outcome Clinical observation was made during each of the patient’s physical therapy sessions. After 5 weeks, the patient’s LEFI score improved to 30/80. The patient reported that he had no more reoccurring back pain, was able to move much easier, and was able walk more efficiently and with better posture. Conclusion The patient in this case responded positively to a 5-week course of physical therapy that included exercise therapy. His back pain diminished and his function increased after the course of care. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to review previously published meta-analyses on the effectiveness of dietary fiber on type 2 diabetes. Methods An umbrella review of all published meta-analyses was performed. A PubMed search from January 1, 1980, to April 30, 2017, was conducted using the following search strategy: (fiber OR glucan OR psyllium) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English-language publications that provided quantitative statistical analysis on type 2 diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentrations, or glycosylated hemoglobin were retrieved. Results Sixteen meta-analyses were retrieved for inclusion in this umbrella review. In the meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest dietary fiber intake, there was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk (RR) of type 2 diabetes (RR = 0.81-0.85), with the greatest benefit coming from cereal fibers (RR = 0.67-0.87). However, statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in all of these meta-analyses. In the meta-analyses of supplementation studies using β-glucan or psyllium fibers on type 2 diabetic participants, statistically significant reductions were identified in both fasting blood glucose concentrations and glycosylated hemoglobin percentages. Conclusion This review suggests that those consuming the highest amounts of dietary fiber, especially cereal fiber, may benefit from a reduction in the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes. There also appears to be a small reduction in fasting blood glucose concentration, as well as a small reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin percentage for individuals with type 2 diabetes who add β-glucan or psyllium to their daily dietary intake.

"Objective The purpose of this narrative literature review is to discuss the literature regarding the potential role that cytokines play in degenerative disk disease. Methods The inclusion criteria were studies that used inflammatory mediators in advancing disk disease processes. Research studies were limited to the last 3 decades that had free full-text available online in English. Exclusion criteria were review articles and articles pertaining to temporomandibular joints and other joints of the body other than the intervertebral disk. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar through March 13, 2017. Results A total of 82 studies were included in this review. The papers were reviewed for complex mechanisms behind the degenerative cascade, emphasizing the role of proinflammatory cytokines, which may be instrumental in processes of inflammation, neurologic pain, and disk degeneration. Interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α were among the more notable cytokines involved in this cascade. Because monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 stimulates and activates macrophages in the event of infiltration, additional proinflammatory cytokines are released to act on molecules to promote blood and nerve ingrowth, resulting in pain signaling and tissue degradation. Excessive inflammation and/or tissue damage initiates a pathologic imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes. Conclusions This literature review describes how inflammatory and biochemical changes may trigger disk degeneration. Proinflammatory cytokines stimulate microvascular blood and nerve ingrowth, resulting in pain signaling and tissue degradation. This may sensitize a person to chemical and/or mechanical stimuli, contributing to severe low back pain. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of completing a study comparing the impact of lower body strength training to proprioceptive exercises on vertical jump capacity. Methods Thirty-nine college students (age 27.9 ± 6.4 y, height 1.69 ± 0.10 m, body mass 73.4 ± 15.9 kg: mean ± standard deviation) underwent baseline and post-testing of their vertical jump capacity using a Vertical Challenger and VICON motion analysis system. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 interventional groups between testing sessions: (1) lower body strength training, (2) lower body proprioceptive training, and (3) a no training control. Group 1 underwent supervised exercises 3 days a week at 2 sets of 12 repetitions of squats, seated knee extensions, standing knee flexions, and standing calf raises at approximately 25% of their body weight. Group 2 participants engaged in 4 supervised proprioceptive exercise stations 3 days a week involving BOSU ball stance, Rocker board, Bodyblade, and 1-legged stance exercises at 4 minutes per station. A between–within repeated-measures analysis of variance using between-participants factor “group” and within-participants factor “time” (baseline and post-test) was used to analyze data. Results Analysis of group × time indicated a small positive improvement in overall group performance for jump height at post-test, F(2,36) = 5.527, P = .008, r = 0.36. However, post hoc testing identified no statistically significant difference between groups for dependent variables. F P r F P r Conclusions This study determined that it was feasible to complete a study to compare 2 groups, but more than 1 week would be required to observe differences between lower body weight training and lower body proprioceptive training on vertical jump.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate correlative factors affecting chronic low back pain (CLBP), with special emphasis on the radiographic postural findings in the sagittal lumbosacral spine. Methods A cross-sectional study alongside a randomized trial was conducted. Standing lateral lumbar spine radiographs from 352 patients with CLBP enrolled in a randomized trial were analyzed and radiographic mensuration of lumbar lordosis, lumbosacral disc angle, and sacral inclination performed. These angles were correlated with baseline variables, including CLBP intensity, age, and sex. Multiple polynomial regressions were performed in which CLBP intensity was regressed on linear and quadratic terms of lumbar lordosis to investigate the possibility of greater pain with hypo- and/or hyperlordosis. Results There was no significant correlation of the angles with pain and age (r ≤ 0.09, P > .05). Weak but statistically significant correlation was identified between all 3 measurements and sex (r = –0.12 to 0.21, P < .05). Greater pain was not noted for hypo- and hyperlordosis; regression coefficients for the linear and quadratic effects were approximately 0 (P > .05). r P r P P r P r P P Conclusion This study determined that there was no correlation between lumbar lordosis and pain levels for people with CLBP; thus, use of lumbar spine radiographic mensuration in the management of pain for people with CLBP is not recommended.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability of image assessment of infrared thermography of the plantar surface of people with diabetes mellitus. Methods Fifty-one participants with diabetes were included. The interexaminer reliability (test) consisted of measuring the temperature of the plantar surface by 2 evaluators who separately performed the analysis of thermographic images. The intraexaminer reliability (retest) consisted of the revaluation of the images by a single evaluator 10 days after the first analysis. Results The analysis of intrareliability and interreliability indicated excellent levels of correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.75, 95% confidence interval >0.70) in the plantar surface points analyzed. Conclusion Infrared thermography image evaluation identified intrareliability and interreliability for temperature analysis of the plantar surface of people with diabetes mellitus. However, further studies need to be conducted to assess validity and its application in health care. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a modified Bragard test compared with the straight leg raise (SLR) test in patients presenting with electrodiagnostic evidence of L5 and S1 nerve root compression. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 506 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms consistent with lumbosacral radiculopathy confirmed by electrodiagnostic study. Patients were evaluated from September 2013 to September 2015 in the physical medicine and rehabilitation outpatient clinic of Shahid Faghihi Teaching Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. The SLR test was investigated concomitantly to determine the sensitivity and specificity. Results Electrodiagnostic study findings indicated lumbosacral radiculopathy in 312 patients. Of these participants, 198 were positive on SLR testing, and of 114 SLR-negative patients, 79 were positive on Modified Bragard testing. Sensitivity of the Modified Bragard test was 69.3%, and specificity was 67.42%. Positive and negative predictive values were 73.15% and 63.16%, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio was 2.13, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.46. Diagnostic odds ratio was 4.63. In patients with symptom duration of less than 3 weeks, SLR sensitivity and specificity decreased as the Modified Bragard test diagnostic accuracy increased. Conclusions The Modified Bragard test is easy to perform and has an acceptable test performance, which can help to increase the discriminative power of clinical examination in patients with L5 or S1 nerve root compression who exhibit a negative SLR test result, especially in the acute phase of disease.

"Objective The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate differences between doctors of chiropractic with respect to their preference for the biomedical or biopsychosocial attitude and belief models. Methods Alumni of the University of Western States doctor of chiropractic program were asked to complete an online survey that included the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists. This scale yields a biomedical score (10-60 scale) and a biopsychosocial score (9-54 scale). These scores are reported for 5 participant characteristics: sex, country of residence (USA vs other), chiropractic program completed (University of Western States vs other), decade of graduation, and years in practice. Secondarily, multiple linear regression was performed to evaluate the independent effects of participant characteristics on the 2 Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists scales. Results Of 3877 surveys, 233 were included in the analysis (response rate = 4.7%-7.4%). The mean biomedical scale score was 33.9 (standard deviation = 6.5), and the mean biopsychosocial scale score was 32.4 (standard deviation = 4.1). There was little variation in scores across the 5 participant characteristics (P > .05). Cronbach’s α for the biomedical scale reached an acceptable level of internal consistency (0.74). In contrast, Cronbach’s α for the biopsychosocial scale was 0.40. P P Conclusion This preliminary study found that in a sample of chiropractic program alumni of the University of Western States, there were no differences with respect to preference for the biomedical or biopsychosocial attitude and belief models. A better understanding requires a larger study comparing attitudes/beliefs with behavior in practice. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of grade IV lumbar mobilization on the activity/contraction of erector spinae (ES) and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles in healthy people. Methods A randomized, repeated-measures design was used. Sixteen healthy subjects attended 3 testing sessions with a different intervention in each session (no intervention, grade IV central lumbar mobilization at L4, and placebo/light touch). Lying in a prone position, subjects lifted a light weight with their right arm while ultrasound images of LM and surface electromyography signals of ES were captured before and immediately after application of the intervention in the session. The contraction of LM was calculated from US images, and the root mean square was calculated from the electromyography signals of ES and used as outcome measures. Results A significant difference was found in LM contraction between the placebo and mobilization intervention (difference = 0.04, P = .02). There was no difference for the root mean square of electromyography signals between the interventions. P P Conclusion The significant difference in LM contraction was small and may not have clinical significance. Lumbar mobilization did not change the activity of ES in healthy people. Future studies with larger samples are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the effect of mobilization on back muscles in people with low back pain. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to review previously published meta-analyses on the effectiveness of dietary fiber on cardiovascular disease. Methods An umbrella review of all published meta-analyses was performed. A PubMed search from January 1, 1980, to January 31, 2017, was conducted using the following search strategy: (fiber OR glucan OR psyllium OR fructans) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English-language publications that provided quantitative statistical analysis on cardiovascular disease, lipid concentrations, or blood pressure were retrieved. Results Thirty-one meta-analyses were retrieved for inclusion in this umbrella review, and all meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest dietary fiber intake reported statistically significant reductions in the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease mortality (RR = 0.77-0.83), as well as the incidences of cardiovascular disease (RR = 0.72-0.91), coronary heart disease (RR = 0.76-0.93), and stroke (RR = 0.83-0.93). Meta-analyses on supplementation studies using β-glucan or psyllium fibers also reported statistically significant reductions in both total serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion This review suggests that individuals consuming the highest amounts of dietary fiber intake can significantly reduce their incidence and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Mechanistically, these beneficial effects may be due to dietary fibers' actions on reducing total serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations between 9.3 to 14.7 mg/dL and 10.8 to 13.5 mg/dL, respectively.

"Objective The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of adding cryostimulation to manual therapy in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis. Methods The control group (n = 19) was treated with manual therapy consisting of soft-tissue therapy and radial head mobilizations. The experimental group (n = 18) received cryostimulation in addition to manual therapy care similar to that for the control group. Both protocols consisted of 8 treatments over a 4-week period. Outcome measures included pain intensity (visual analog scale), pain-free grip strength (handheld dynamometer), and functional index (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation questionnaire). Assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. Adherence and dropout rates were also considered. Results Both groups exhibited significant improvements in pain intensity and functional index at postintervention assessments, which were maintained at follow-up. All participants attended the prescribed number of treatments, but 27% were lost at follow-up. Minor adverse events were reported after cryostimulation in 4 cases. Conclusions This study indicated that it is feasible to complete a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of adding cryostimulation to manual therapy in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis. On the basis of these preliminary data, the combination of cryostimulation and manual therapy care did not provide any additional benefits in both the short term and the long term. Manual myofascial point treatment and mobilization techniques yielded positive outcomes in chronic lateral epicondylitis. Further studies should focus on the sole therapeutic effect of cryostimulation in both patients with acute and those with chronic conditions. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the intra- and interexaminer reliability of the upper trapezius muscle and fascia thickness measured by ultrasonography imaging and strain ratio by sonoelastography in participants with myofascial pain syndrome. Methods Thirty-two upper trapezius muscles were assessed. Two examiners measured the upper trapezius thickness and strain ratio 3 times by ultrasonography and sonoelastography independently in the test session. The retest session was completed 6 to 8 days later. Results A total of 87.5% of participants had trigger points on the right side, and 22.5% had trigger points on the left side. For the test session, the average upper trapezius thickness, fascia thickness, and strain ratio measured by first and second examiners were 11.86 mm and 11.56 mm, 1.23 mm and 1.25 mm, and 0.94 and 0.99, respectively. For the retest session, the previously mentioned parameters obtained by first and second examiners were 11.76 mm and 11.39 mm, 1.27 mm and 1.29 mm, and 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients indicated good to excellent reliability for both within-intraexaminer (0.78-0.96) and between-intraexaminer (0.75-0.98) measurements. Also, the intraclass correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurement of interexaminer reliability ranged between 0.88 to 0.93 and 0.05 to 0.44 for both muscle and fascia thickness and 0.70 to 0.75 and 0.04 to 0.20 for strain ratio of upper trapezius, respectively. Conclusion Upper trapezius thickness measurements by ultrasonography and strain ratio by sonoelastography are reliable methods in participants with myofascial pain syndrome. "
"Objective The goal of the study was to determine if there was an association between chronic venous disorders (CVDs), particularly venous leg ulcers, and ankle range of motion (ROM) in the Dominican Republic. Methods Chronic venous disorders were classified using the clinical manifestations portion (C) of the CEAP (clinical manifestations, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology) method. The legs of participants attending mobile chiropractic clinics in rural, low-income areas in the Dominican Republic were assessed for clinical signs of CVD and venous ulcers. Ankle ROM was then measured, and photographs of the legs were taken. The 6 clinical stages of CVD were divided into 3 groups: normal legs (normal), no ulcer CVD, and ulcer CVD (healed and active). Multiple linear regression of ankle ROM against CVD grouping was used to test the association. Results Eight of the 837 patients for whom CVD classification was obtained had venous ulcers (healed or active) on at least 1 leg. About 30% relative reduction in ROM (ankle dorsiflexion plus plantar flexion) was observed between the ulcer group and the normal group. Regression analysis comparing legs with ulcers to healthy legs (normal), adjusted for age, gender, indicator for obesity, and previous leg trauma, revealed a significant decrease of approximately 14° (P = .0007) in ankle ROM. Age was also found to be strongly significant in the regression analysis, 1 year of aging was associated with a decrease of 0.16° (P < .0001) in ankle ROM (approximately 1.6° in 10 years). P P P P Conclusion A significant decrease was observed in ankle ROM for participants with active and healed leg venous ulcers compared with those without ulcers. There appeared to be an association between venous leg ulcers and ankle ROM in this sample. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the position of scapula in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain. Methods A total of 17 participants with a history of nonspecific chronic low back pain and 17 healthy participants in the same age, sex, and weight range were enrolled in this case-control study. Lateral scapular slide test and Lennie test were used for clinical evaluation of scapular position in the frontal plane using a tape measure. The data were analyzed using an independent t test. t t Results The results of lateral scapular slide test indicated that there were significant differences between patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain and healthy individuals in both left and right sides in 2 positions: shoulder in neutral position and shoulder at 40°-45° abduction. Also, in the Lennie test, there was only a significant difference between groups when we measured the distances from thoracic spinous process to the inferior angle of the scapula in both left and right sides. Conclusion This study indicated that upward rotation of the scapula can be seen in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain. "
"Objective Researchers have identified potential errors in the Gonstead method’s analysis of pelvic alignment resulting from y-axis rotation of the pelvis on the anteroposterior (A-P) radiograph. The purpose of this article is to propose a method that can be used to determine the magnitude of y-axis rotation of the pelvis present on the A-P radiograph. y y y y Methods In this proposed method, measurements are obtained from the patient and from the lateral and A-P radiographs. With a mathematical method, these measurements are used with the focal film distance to calculate the degree of pelvic rotation present on an individual A-P radiograph. Results This method may help with the accuracy of measurement of pelvic y-axis rotation on the A-P radiograph. y y Conclusion The method proposed can be used to calculate the magnitude of pelvic y-axis rotation on an A-P radiograph. y y "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate static and dynamic balance tests in single, dual cognitive, and dual manual task conditions in participants with and without nonspecific chronic low back pain. Methods In this case control study, 40 patients (age range 18-50 years) with nonspecific chronic low back pain for at least 3 months and 40 healthy participants matched for age, weight, height, and sex participated in this study. Balance performance was evaluated using static (One Leg Stance) and dynamic (Modified Star Excursion Balance Test, 10-m walk test, and Timed Up and Go) balance tests. All tests were performed in three conditions: single task (balance only), dual cognitive task (balance and counting numbers backward), and dual manual task (balance and carrying a cup of water). Results The results indicated that different balance tests were impaired in dual task conditions compared with single task in each group. Cognitive and balance performances were not significantly different between nonspecific chronic low back pain and healthy participants in all clinical balance tests. Conclusion It seems that the static and dynamic balance performance under dual task conditions (excluding the Modified Star Excursion Balance Test) was impaired in each group. Dual tasking did not differ between nonspecific chronic low back pain participants with low level of pain and disability compared with healthy participants. "
"Objectives The purpose of the current study was to compare central and peripheral bone mineral density at different regions including spine, hip, and wrist in postmenopausal women. Methods Forty postmenopausal women participated in this study. Their mean age, body mass, height, and body mass index were 53.5 ± 2.75 y, 68.6 ± 8.68 kg, 167.8 ± 6.46 cm, and 24.31 ± 1.69 kg/m2, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores of spine, hip, and wrist regions were measured for all participants with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan. 2 T 2 T Results All measured regions (spine, hip, and wrist) had low BMD T-scores. Bone mineral density of the wrist was significantly lower (–2.58 ± 2.18) than that of both spine (–1.79 ± 0.98) and hip (–1.69 ± 1.37). In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in BMD between the spine and hip. T T Conclusions In this group of postmenopausal women, wrist BMD decreased more than spine and hip BMD. Both spine and hip BMD decreased by nearly the same percentage in postmenopausal women. Peripheral sites may be more representative of osteoporosis than central sites. Trial Registration: PACTR201602001478123. "
"Objective The purpose of this review was to explore the association between forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and increased thoracic kyphosis. Methods The PubMed, ERIC, and Cochrane databases were searched using the key words posture, head, shoulder, forward scapular posture, and thoracic kyphosis through December 2016. posture, head, shoulder, forward scapular posture, thoracic kyphosis posture, head, shoulder, forward scapular posture, thoracic kyphosis Results Our initial search yielded 6840 research studies, 6769 of which were excluded because they either were duplicates or did not satisfy the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts of the remaining studies were read, 15 were assessed for eligibility, and only 4 papers were included in the present review. Cervical lordosis values were found to be significantly associated with thoracic kyphosis values. Also, there were significant correlations between rounded shoulders and increased thoracic kyphosis. Conclusion Forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and increased thoracic kyphosis can exist alone or in any combination. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the conservative management of 2 cases of acquired torticollis in children under 3 years of age. Clinical Features Both patients awoke with painful, stiff, twisted necks the day after play in a bouncy house. Range of motion was limited, and hypertonic muscles were palpated. Their neurologic and physical evaluation was consistent with a diagnosis of acquired torticollis of musculoskeletal origin. Intervention and Outcomes Both children were treated with chiropractic care that consisted of light myofascial release, use of an Activator instrument, and home stretching. Patients improved in pain and range of motion immediately posttreatment and returned to normal ranges in 1 or 2 visits. Conclusion Chiropractic care provided relief for these 2 young patients with acquired torticollis. "
"Objective The objective of this study was to investigate if the research process to evaluate the effect of foot manipulation on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) is feasible. Methods A randomized, single-blind (patients and evaluators) pilot trial was performed to compare foot manipulation to a comparative group at 6-weekly treatment sessions at 5 physiotherapy outpatient clinics in Skaraborg primary care (Skövde, Sweden). Women at 12 to 31 weeks of pregnancy with well-defined PPGP (n = 97) and joint dysfunction or decreased range of movement in the feet were included. Women with a twin pregnancy, low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, or other serious diseases and those who had previous foot manipulation were excluded. Visual analog scale scores were recorded before study start, before and after each treatment session, and 3 months after delivery. Results One-hundred and two women were eligible, and 97 were included (group 1: foot manipulation, n = 47; group 2: comparative treatment, n = 50); 40 and 36 in the foot manipulation and comparative treatment groups, respectively, completed the study. The foot manipulation group had a nonsignificant pain relief score compared with that of the comparative group, which had higher pain relief scores. The difference was most pronounced at the first and second treatment sessions. A power analysis showed that at least 250 individuals would be needed in each group to confirm the effect of foot manipulation. Conclusions This study showed that it is feasible to assess the effect of foot manipulation on PPGP in a multicenter physical therapy outpatient clinic setting. A new larger study should choose a different comparative method and test this hypothesis in a full-scale trial. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of adding lumbar sustained natural apophyseal glide (SNAG) to a conventional therapy program for chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Methods Forty-two participants with chronic nonspecific LBP were randomly divided into 2 groups. The study group (aged 27.1 ± 8.3, 20 men, 3 women) received a conventional physical therapy program consisted of stretching and strengthening exercises plus SNAG (based on the Mulligan concept) on the affected lumbar levels, and the control group (aged 28.9 ± 7.7, 13 men, 6 women) received the same conventional program without SNAG 3 times per week for 1 month. Outcome measures were repositioning error (the primary outcome), pain, and function measured by an isokinetic dynamometer, visual analog scale, and the Oswestry Disability Index. Measurements were recorded before and after the end of the treatment period. Results The comparison between pretreatment and posttreatment test scores indicated that both study and control groups had significant improvement in all dependent variables (P > .001). However, adding SNAG to the conventional program resulted in higher improvement in terms of repositioning error, pain, and function (P = .02, .002, .008) respectively. P P P P Conclusions This preliminary study indicated improvement in both groups. Adding SNAG to conventional programs in the treatment of chronic nonspecific LBP may result in greater improvement of repositioning error, pain reduction, and improved function. "
"Objective The purpose of this paper was to review the literature regarding the measurement properties of various angles used for postural assessment of the head, neck, shoulder, and thorax and to discuss the utility of these measures. Methods The inclusion criteria for this literature review were use of postural angles to assess posture, measurement of upper body posture, and research studies conducted in last 3 decades that had free full-text available online entirely in the English language. The exclusion criteria were review articles; studies involving subjects having obesity, visual problems, any history of surgery, respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, or congenital pathology or disease; and research studies in which postural angles were measured with respect to vertical only. The following databases were searched: PubMed Central, PubMed, ResearchGate, Springer Link, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scielo through February 20, 2016. Results A total of 21 studies that were found to be best suited to explain the craniovertebral (CV) angle, sagittal head tilt, sagittal shoulder-C7 angle, coronal head tilt, coronal shoulder angle, and thoracic kyphosis angle were included in this review. Craniovertebral angle, sagittal head tilt, sagittal shoulder-C7 angle, coronal head tilt, and coronal shoulder angle possess moderate to high intrarater reliability. Craniovertebral angle, sagittal head tilt, sagittal shoulder-C7 angle and thoracic kyphosis angle possess high interrater reliability (except for sagittal head tilt when measured using the goniometer). Craniovertebral angle, sagittal head tilt, and sagittal shoulder-C7 angle have been proved to be valid measures of posture when compared with similar angles measured on radiographs. None of the studies reported intrarater reliability of thoracic kyphosis angle, interrater reliability of coronal head tilt and coronal shoulder angle, and validity of coronal angles and thoracic kyphosis angle. Conclusions We found several reliable methods to measure the postures of the head, neck, shoulder, and thoracic regions by measuring the CV angle, sagittal head tilt, sagittal shoulder-C7 angle, and thoracic kyphosis angle, respectively. Standardization of methods for angular measurement is recommended so that there is uniformity among studies regarding camera height, participant-camera distance, and type of software to generate normative data for postural angles.

"Objective The primary objective of the current study was to determine the reliability between methods of supine and prone leg length inequality (LLI) assessment. The secondary objective was to determine if the degree of examiner confidence affected the degree of intermethod agreement. Methods Two experienced doctors of chiropractic assessed 43 participants for LLI, one using a prone and the other a supine method. They stated whether they were confident or not confident in their findings. Results Kappa values for intermethod agreement were 0.16 for the full data set; 0.00 for the n = 20 subgroup with both examiners confident; 0.24 for the n = 18 subgroup with 1 examiner confident; and 0.55 for the n = 5 subgroup with neither examiner confident. Supine and prone measures exhibited slight agreement for the full data set, but no agreement when both examiners were confident. The moderate agreement with both examiners not confident may be an artifact of small sample size. Conclusions This study found that supine and prone assessments for leg length inequality were not in agreement. Positioning the patient in the prone position may increase, decrease, reverse, or offset the observed LLI that is seen in the supine position. "
"Objective The purpose of this case study is to describe the presentation of a patient with plasmacytoma. Clinical Features A 49-year-old man presented with progressive neck pain, stiffness, and dysphagia to a chiropractic office. A radiograph indicated a plasmacytoma at C3 vertebral body. The lesion was expansile and caused a mass effect anteriorly on the esophagus and posteriorly on the spinal cord. Neurologic compromise was noted with fasciculations and hypesthesia in the right forearm. The patient was referred to a neurosurgeon. Intervention and Outcome Surgical resection of the tumor was performed with a vertebral body spacer and surrounding titanium cage. Bony fusion was initiated by inserting bone grafts from the iliac crests into the titanium cage. Additional laboratory analysis and advanced imaging confirmed that the plasmacytoma had progressed to multiple myeloma and radiation and chemotherapy were also necessary. Conclusion A chiropractor recognized a large, expansile plasmacytoma in the C3 vertebral body and referred the patient for surgical care. This case suggests that all practitioners of manual medicine should provide a careful analysis of the patient’s clinical presentation and, if clinically warranted, radiographic examination to determine neck or back pain is due to an underlying malignant condition.

"Objective The purpose of this case series was to describe the short-term and long-term clinical effects of a manual technique for treating osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain. Methods This study measured of the immediate effect and long-term effect by using a case series of different groups of subjects. Knee OA and activity restriction in patients were evaluated by using the Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) Grading Scale and the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) index. In the intervention, lower limb muscles were squeezed by hand for 20 seconds. Each squeeze was performed for both lower limbs. Passive range-of-motion (ROM) exercise was performed on the knee joint. In one set of cases, immediate effects were measured after a one-time treatment with pretreatment and posttreatment outcome measures. Eleven people with knee OA participated in the study. On a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, muscle stiffness, and muscular hemodynamics for estimation of muscle blood flow were recorded before and after the squeeze-hold treatment. In another set of cases, the treatment was given to all patients once a week for 6 months, and long-term effects were measured. Data on 5 subjects with knee OA were collected for 6 months after initial treatment. The VAS for pain and JKOM were recorded every month for 6 months. Results For immediate effects, the VAS was 69 ± 21 mm before treatment and 26 ± 22 mm after treatment. Muscle stiffness was 8.8 ± 3.6 (absolute number) before treatment and 3.5 ± 2.1 after treatment. Tissue (muscle) oxygen saturation was 60.1 ± 5.7% before treatment and 65.3 ± 4.8% after treatment. Total hemoglobin was 24.3 ± 3.3 (absolute number) before treatment and 25 ± 2.3 after treatment. A tendency for reduction in OA knee pain and muscle stiffness was observed, and a tendency for increase was observed in the blood flow in the muscle. For long-term effects in all 5 participants (any K/L grade, any JKOM score), OA knee pain and JKOM score improved gradually through 6 months. Conclusions The participants in this case series showed improvement in pain and function. These findings indicate the feasibility of a larger study on the squeeze-hold intervention for OA knee pain.

"Objective This study sought to investigate correlations between OptoGait motion analysis technology and 2 commonly used concussion assessment instruments, the Balance Evaluation Scoring System (BESS) and the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) computerized neurocognitive assessment software, to see if OptoGait might be a valid concussion assessment tool. Methods Twenty Division-1 college women varsity soccer players completed trials of 8 different conditions of the OptoGait test battery. Then participants completed the BESS and ImPACT tests. One hundred twenty-eight total spatiotemporal variables were recorded for each trial of OptoGait. Pearson’s r correlations among these variables and BESS and ImPACT results were calculated, and pattern analysis was completed to evaluate for emergent patterns in the data. r r Results Correlations for the 8 OptoGait mean-score subtests were related to the balance double-leg foam test (BESS). Correlations for the 8 OptoGait mean-score subtests were related to the balance double-leg foam test (BESS), and correlations between OptoGait standard deviation measures and the balance tandem hard surface test (BESS) both indicated potentially significant patterns. No consistent patterns of correlation existed between the OptoGait variables and the ImPACT results. Conclusion OptoGait conditions correlate at higher than predicted rates with subtests of the BESS instruments but not the ImPACT measures. "
"Objective The purpose of this review was to evaluate the current body of literature on chiropractic treatment of idiopathic scoliosis against the 2014 consensus paper of the Society on Scoliosis Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) and the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) Non-Operative Management Committee for outcome reporting in nonoperative treatments. Methods A search of the PubMed and Index to Chiropractic Literature databases for studies published from January 2000 through February 2016 detailing specific treatments and outcomes for idiopathic scoliosis was conducted. Results A total of 27 studies that discussed chiropractic scoliosis treatments were identified. Of these, there were 15 case reports, 10 case series, 1 prospective cohort, and 1 randomized clinical trial. Of the 27 studies, only 2 described their outcomes as recommended in the 2014 SOSORT and SRS Non-Operative Management Committee consensus paper. Conclusion The 2014 SOSORT and SRS Non-Operative Committee consensus paper details the format and types of outcomes they collectively believe are the most important and relevant to the patient. Among the chiropractic studies located in this review, 2 described outcomes consistent with how SOSORT recommends they be reported. Given that these consensus papers form the basis for nonoperative treatment recommendations and outcome reporting, future chiropractic studies should seek to report their outcomes as recommended by these papers. This will allow for better interprofessional collaboration and methodologic comparison. "
"Objective The purpose of this report was to describe the presentation of a patient with hereditary multiple exostoses and thoracic spinal cord compression from an osteochondroma. Clinical Features A 31-year-old female presented to a chiropractic clinic with a history of hereditary multiple exostoses and back pain that had existed since the age of 16 years. She had a past medical history that was remarkable for 3 prior surgeries for mass removal. Examination revealed a left upper midscapular mass with decreased sensation. Intervention/Outcome Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and biopsy led to a diagnosis of osteochondroma. These diagnostic modalities confirmed that there was no malignant degeneration. Initial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large expansive lesion involving the left posterior elements at the region of T3-T4. Subsequent thoracic hemilaminectomy and resection of the spinal tumor with posterior instrumentation and stabilization from T2-T5 resulted in 90% overall subjective improvement. Conclusions A detailed case history, thorough examination, guided advanced imaging, and biopsy provide important information for the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of expansive lesions in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported knowledge of concussion recognition and treatment with first-contact family medical and chiropractic practitioners by means of a pilot study of the need, construct validity, and feasibility for further investigation of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) knowledge base. Methods Two hundred forty-eight practicing chiropractic and 120 medical physicians in the south and northeastern sections of the United States were contacted by e-mail, telephone, and postal mail to answer an 18-item survey on knowledge, diagnosis, and common practice with respect to traumatic brain injury patients. Descriptive analysis was used to assess common trends. Results Twenty-three chiropractic and 11 medical primary care practitioners returned completed surveys, making this a low-power pilot study. The majority claimed confidence in diagnosis of MTBI, but a lack of knowledge of many of the assessment tools and the international guidelines. Chiropractic and medical clinicians revealed similar competencies and differing deficiencies. Both groups admitted infrequent diagnosis of MTBI in practice. There was recognition of major TBI signs, but lack of recognition or inquiry for subtle MTBI signs. Conclusions There is a need and feasibility for further study of the knowledge transfer to the chiropractic physician with a larger population. These findings correlate with similar medical practitioner studies, and may also support previous findings of underreporting of the prevalence of MTBI. The survey instrument appears to provide valid data on knowledge of MTBIs, with some modifications. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report was to describe chiropractic management of thoracic pain in a patient with a stable thoracic aortic aneurysm. Clinical Features An 89-year-old man presented with axial mid- and upper back pain localized predominantly at the T8 and T1 spinal segmental levels. A review of available imaging revealed a stable aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta, which measured 4.3 cm. Intervention and Outcome Because the thoracic pain was musculoskeletal in nature and the thoracic aortic aneurysm was stable, mechanical manipulation was provided using the Impulse adjusting instrument. The patient’s pain was measured utilizing a numeric rating scale. The patient’s thoracic pain improved over the course of treatment. Conclusion This patient was successfully treated for thoracic spine pain with a course of chiropractic care using a mechanical adjusting instrument. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in pain, disability, and range of movement after cervicothoracic manipulation plus exercise therapy in individuals with unilateral shoulder impingement syndrome. Methods Forty-one patients (30 men, 11 women; aged 47 ± 9) diagnosed with unilateral shoulder impingement syndrome attended 10 sessions for 5 weeks (2 sessions/wk). Eligible patients were randomly allocated to 2 study groups: cervicothoracic manipulation plus exercise therapy (n = 21) or home exercise program (n = 20). The outcomes measures included the visual analog scale (VAS); the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score; Shoulder Disability Questionnaire; subacromial impingement syndrome (Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Test); and shoulder active range of motion (movements of flexion, extension, rotation, adduction, and abduction). Assessments were applied at baseline and 24 hours after completing 5 weeks of related interventions. Results After 5 weeks of treatment significant between-group differences were observed in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (P = .012); however, no statistically significant differences were achieved for Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (P = .061) and pain intensity (P = .859). Both groups improved with regard to disability and clinical tests for detecting subacromial impingement syndrome. P P P P P P Conclusions This clinical trial suggests that cervicothoracic manipulative treatment with mobilization plus exercise therapy may improve intensity of pain and range of motion compared with the home exercise group alone; the home exercise group had significant changes for flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction, but not for external and internal rotation movement in patients with shoulder impingement.

"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the methods to conduct a substantive clinical trial to evaluate the effects of accessory joint mobilization (AJM) vs neural mobilization (NM) techniques for shoulder motion restriction after breast cancer surgery. Methods This pilot study was a prospective randomized and double-blind clinical trial in which 18 women who underwent unilateral breast cancer surgery and axillary lymph node dissection participated. The study was conducted at the Women’s Health Research Group at the Physical Therapy Department of Alcalá University, Madrid, Spain. The intervention was AJM vs NM, with a 6-month follow-up. Primary outcomes included recruitment, adherence to treatment and retention rates, assessment procedures, and implementation of the 2 manual therapy techniques. Secondary outcomes included range of motion, sensory disturbance, pain, and upper limb functionality. Results All participants accepted to be randomly assigned to study groups. One hundred percent retention was attained with all participants attending the 3-month and 6-month assessments. Adherence with treatment attendance was excellent. At 6-month follow-up, flexion range of motion had a mean change of 38.4° (±28.9) (P = .002) in the AJM group and a mean change of 36.8° (±21.8) (P = .002) in the NM group. Abduction range of motion had a median change of 52.4° (±43.6) (P = .004) in AJM group and a median change of 44° (±17.5) (P = .012). P P = P = P = P P = P = P = Conclusions These preliminary results of the effects of AJM and NM techniques in breast cancer survivors indicate that a full clinical trial will be worthwhile. The research methods tested and the modifications proposed within this pilot study offer a suitable foundation to conduct a substantive clinical trial. "
"Objectives The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the treatment effectiveness of the combination of manual therapy (MT) with other physical therapy techniques. Methods Systematic searches of scientific literature were undertaken on PubMed and the Cochrane Library (2004-2014). The following terms were used: “patellofemoral pain syndrome,” “physical therapy,” “manual therapy,” and “manipulation.” RCTs that studied adults diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) treated by MT and physical therapy approaches were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Jadad Scale. Results Five RCTs with an acceptable methodological quality (Jadad ≥ 3) were selected. The studies indicated that MT combined with physical therapy has some effect on reducing pain and improving function in PFPS, especially when applied on the full kinetic chain and when strengthening hip and knee muscles. Conclusions The different combinations of MT and physical therapy programs analyzed in this review suggest that giving more emphasis to proximal stabilization and full kinetic chain treatments in PFPS will help better alleviation of symptoms.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to survey the use of musculoskeletal diagnostic ultrasound imaging (MSK-DUSI) at chiropractic educational programs worldwide and to elicit opinions of academic diagnostic imaging staff of its prospective use at their teaching institutions. Methods An electronic questionnaire was delivered in 2014 using SurveyMonkey and notifications were disseminated by e-mail to 127 diagnostic imaging staff at chiropractic programs worldwide. The questionnaire consisted of 27 items using multiple-choice, Likert-type, and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used for basic demographic data and the results of the numerical scales used in each item. Results Fifty-nine respondents (46.5%) from 24 (24/41) chiropractic programs returned questionnaires. The reported use of MSK-DUSI at chiropractic programs is low (n = 5/24); however, respondents from 9 institutions stated that it is planned to be implemented. Few respondents stated they had formal MSK-DUSI qualifications (4/59); however, 7 respondents stated they were in the process of becoming certified. Most respondents expressed an interest in the prospect of incorporating MSK-DUSI at their chiropractic program. Sixty-five percent stated that chiropractic programs should provide MSK-DUSI training to chiropractic students, and 75% of respondents stated that chiropractic programs should be providing accredited postgraduate MSK-DUSI courses. Conclusions The current use of MSK-DUSI among chiropractic programs that responded to this survey is low. The opinions of diagnostic imaging staff who responded suggest a positive attitude to its use and possible growth in its use if foundational work, including gaining funding, accreditation, and acceptance of within the scope of chiropractic practice, is undertaken.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of a posture-cuing shirt on internal rotation velocity of the shoulder during a tennis swing and to determine this influence on shoulder external rotation position. Methods Nine healthy competitive college tennis players from a Division III college participated in this study. High-speed motion capture allowed for 3-dimensional analysis of shoulder kinematics during a tennis serve. Two conditions were evaluated while the athletes performed a high-velocity tennis serve: a standard tennis shirt and a posture-cuing shirt. Results Shoulder internal rotation velocity increased when wearing the posture-cuing shirt. Peak internal rotation velocity increased from 960.61°/s ± 93.24°/s to 1217.96°/s ± 155.01°/s (t = –1.76, P = .058). Internal rotation velocity at the time of impact increased from 765.18°/s ± 95.48°/s to 900.54°/s ± 105.33°/s (t = –1.50, P = .086). Shoulder maximum external rotation did not differ between the 2 conditions, at 172.00° ± 2.92° and 170.89° ± 3.70° (t = 0.325, P = .754). t P t P t P t P t P t P Conclusions Wearing a posture-cuing shirt may possibly alter shoulder kinematics during an overhead sport activity such as tennis. Internal rotation velocity seemed to improve while wearing this shirt, although shoulder external rotation position did not change. It is not known if these improvements can influence injury risk. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to review the effectiveness of the role of whole grain as a therapeutic agent in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and obesity. Methods An umbrella review of all published meta-analyses was performed. A PubMed search from January 1, 1980, to May 31, 2016, was conducted using the following search strategy: (whole grain OR whole grains) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English language publications that provided quantitative statistical analysis on type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and weight loss were retrieved. Results Twenty-one meta-analyses were retrieved for inclusion in this umbrella review, and all the meta-analyses reported statistically significant positive benefits for reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes (relative risk [RR] = 0.68-0.80), cardiovascular disease (RR = 0.63-0.79), and colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancers (RR = 0.57-0.94) and a modest effect on body weight, waist circumference, and body fat mass. Significant reductions in cardiovascular and cancer mortality were also observed (RR = 0.82 and 0.89, respectively). Some problems of heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality assessment were found among the studies. Conclusion This review suggests that there is some evidence for dietary whole grain intake to be beneficial in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. The potential benefits of these findings suggest that the consumption of 2 to 3 servings per day (~45 g) of whole grains may be a justifiable public health goal. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial on the effectiveness of combining spinal manipulation (SM) with standard tobacco cessation counseling. Methods A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants in the intervention group received 2 months of counseling plus SM delivered by doctors of chiropractic, whereas control group participants received counseling alone. Primary outcome measures were smoking decreases and 7-day smoking abstinence as measured by a tobacco diary and urinary cotinine. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results Recruitment proved to be difficult because of reluctance of participants to commit to a 2-month course of care. Ten participants completed this pilot study. Counseling plus SM group participants had greater improvement in the number of cigarettes smoked and urinary cotinine. Three participants achieved at least 7 days of tobacco abstinence, all in the counseling plus SM group. Conclusions In this feasibility study, doctors of chiropractic appeared to be capable of conducting effective smoking cessation counseling. The preliminary information indicated that there may be some benefit for including chiropractic care in addition to counseling. Researchers conducting future studies that are adequately powered should consider using multiple locations and incentives adequate to recruit participants. "
"Objectives This study compared the body contact pressure profiles of 2 types of mattresses: latex and polyurethane. Methods Twenty participants were required to lie down on the different mattresses in 3 different postures for 6 minutes, and their body contact pressure profiles were recorded with a pressure mat sensor. Results The data indicated that the latex mattress was able to reduce the peak body pressure on the torso and buttocks and achieve a higher proportion of low-pressure regions compared with the polyurethane mattress. Conclusions Latex mattress reduced peak body pressure and achieved a more even distribution of pressure compared with polyurethane mattress across different sleeping postures. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to present a narrative review of the literature of musculoskeletal causes of adult hip pain, with special attention to history, physical examination, and diagnostic imaging. Methods A narrative review of the English medical literature was performed by using the search terms “hip pain” AND “anterior,” “lateral,” and “posterior.” Additionally, specific entities of hip pain or pain referral sources to the hip were searched for. We used the PubMed search engine through January 15, 2016. Results Musculoskeletal sources of adult hip pain can be divided into posterior, lateral, and anterior categories. For posterior hip pain, select considerations include lumbar spine and femoroacetabular joint referral, sacroiliac joint pathology, piriformis syndrome, and proximal hamstring tendinopathy. Gluteal tendinopathy and iliotibial band thickening are the most common causes of lateral hip pain. Anterior hip pain is further divided into causes that are intra-articular (ie, labral tear, osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis) and extra-articular (ie, snapping hip and inguinal disruption [athletic pubalgia]). Entrapment neuropathies and myofascial pain should also be considered in each compartment. A limited number of historical features and physical examination tests for evaluation of adult hip pain are supported by the literature and are discussed in this article. Depending on the clinical differential, the gamut of diagnostic imaging modalities recommended for accurate diagnosis include plain film radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, skeletal scintigraphy, and ultrasonography. Conclusions The evaluation of adult hip pain is challenging. Clinicians should consider posterior, lateral, and anterior sources of pain while keeping in mind that these may overlap. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dry needling (DN) on pain intensity and pressure pain threshold (PPT) compared with ischemic compression (IC) immediately and 48 hours after each treatment session in individuals with myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle. Methods Thirty-one patients with myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle participated in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to a standard (N = 17) or experimental group (N = 14). The treatment protocol for the standard group consisted of IC, whereas the patients in the experimental group received DN. Results The results indicated that the effect size of the DN methods for pain intensity and PPT was considerably greater after 2 days compared with immediately after the treatment session. In contrast, the effect of the IC for PPT was greater immediately after treatment compared with the measures after 2 days. There was also no noticeable difference in the effect size for IC on pain intensity between the scores obtained immediately and 2 days after treatment. However, our data also revealed a greater effect size for DN on PPT after 2 days compared with the IC technique. Conclusions In this study, DN improved the pain intensity and PPT after 2 days. However, it had no clinical improvement immediately after application because of muscle soreness. Thus, assessment of the effect of DN immediately after application can be criticized, and the results should be interpreted with caution. "
"Objective The purpose of this narrative review was to describe the most common spinal fusion surgical procedures, address the clinical indications for lumbar fusion in degeneration cases, identify potential complications, and discuss their relevance to chiropractic management of patients after surgical fusion. Methods The PubMed database was searched from the beginning of the record through March 31, 2015, for English language articles related to lumbar fusion or arthrodesis or both and their incidence, procedures, complications, and postoperative chiropractic cases. Articles were retrieved and evaluated for relevance. The bibliographies of selected articles were also reviewed. Results The most typical lumbar fusion procedures are posterior lumbar interbody fusion, anterior lumbar interbody fusion, transforaminal interbody fusion, and lateral lumbar interbody fusion. Fair level evidence supports lumbar fusion procedures for degenerative spondylolisthesis with instability and for intractable low back pain that has failed conservative care. Complications and development of chronic pain after surgery is common, and these patients frequently present to chiropractic physicians. Several reports describe the potential benefit of chiropractic management with spinal manipulation, flexion-distraction manipulation, and manipulation under anesthesia for postfusion low back pain. There are no published experimental studies related specifically to chiropractic care of postfusion low back pain. Conclusions This article describes the indications for fusion, common surgical practice, potential complications, and relevant published chiropractic literature. This review includes 10 cases that showed positive benefits from chiropractic manipulation, flexion-distraction, and/or manipulation under anesthesia for postfusion lumbar pain. Chiropractic care may have a role in helping patients in pain who have undergone lumbar fusion surgery. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of passive versus active soft tissue therapies on pain and ranges of motion in women with latent myofascial trigger points. Methods Forty-two female patients, aged 18 to 64 years, with a history of neck pain and latent myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle were randomly assigned to 3 groups: group A received passive soft tissue therapy, group B received active soft tissue therapy, and a control group C received a sham procedure. The treatment consisted of 3 sessions in a 1-week period with 1-day break between each session. The local pain intensity, measured with a visual analog scale and pain pressure threshold (PPT) using algometry, and active cervical contralateral flexion (ACLF) measured with goniometry, were obtained at baseline, after the third session, and a week after the third session. Results The results indicated a significant decrease in local pain intensity on the visual analog scale within each group (A and B) compared with the control group (C) (P < .05). The passive group had significant improvement in PPT compared with the control group (P < .05). There were no significant differences in ACLF after treatment between the 3 groups (P > .05). P P P P P P Conclusion Both passive and active soft tissue therapies were determined to reduce pain intensity and increase ACLF range of motion, although passive therapy was more effective in increasing PPT in these patients compared with the control group.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of action observation therapy (AOT) compared with written information in patients submitted to a physical therapy program after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Methods We conducted a prospective clinical trial. Twenty-four patients with THA, 62.5% female (aged 69.0 ± 8.5 years), received AOT in addition to conventional physical therapy (experimental group) or written information in addition to conventional physical therapy (exercise and information group) for 10 sessions. Outcomes used were visual analog scale, hip active and passive range of motion, Barthel Index, Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey, Tinetti Scale, and Lequesne Index measurements. All measures were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine the interventions effects within groups and between groups. Results No relevant baseline differences were observed between groups. Both treatments produced statistically significant improvements on visual analog scale, active and passive range of motion, Barthel Index, SF-36, Tinetti Scale, and Lequesne Index immediately after the intervention (all, P < .001). SF-36 (physical functioning subscale) revealed a statistically significant intergroups difference (P = .02) after treatment. P P P P Conclusions Both treatments were effective at improving pain, functional status, quality of life, and gait features in patients with primary THA. In addition to conventional physical therapy, AOT improved perceived physical function more than written information. Trial Registration Identifier NCT02861638. "
Objective The purpose of this paper is to review information regarding the current guidelines for the clinical laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease as set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to chiropractic physicians and to discuss the clinical utility of this testing. Methods The CDC’s website was reviewed to determine what their current recommendations are for the clinical laboratory testing of Lyme disease. Results The CDC’s established guidelines recommend the use of a 2-tiered serologic testing algorithm for the evaluation of patients with suspected Lyme disease. Conclusion This review provides doctors of chiropractic with information to remain current with the CDC’s recommended guidelines for Lyme disease testing because patients may present to their office with the associated signs and symptoms of Lyme disease. 
"Objective l-Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that is the substrate for nitric oxide production by vascular endothelial and immune cells. Nitric oxide production by these cells is essential for both blood pressure regulation and immune regulation. However, there is much discrepancy in the literature when it comes to randomized controlled studies, and so this umbrella review of published meta-analyses was performed to examine the efficacy of l-arginine’s role as a therapeutic agent. l l l l Methods There was an overall search of the literature from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 2015 of three separate databases—PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature—using the following search strategy: (arginine) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English language publications were retrieved that provided quantitative statistical analysis of outcomes on blood pressure and immune function. Results The 7 meta-analyses that were included in this umbrella review reported significant positive benefits for reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive adults by 2.2 to 5.4 mm Hg and 2.7 to 3.1 mm Hg, respectively, reducing diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with gestational hypertension by 4.9 mm Hg, and reducing the length of stay in the hospital for surgical patients; in addition, 2 of the 3 meta-analyses indicated a 40% reduction in the incidence of hospital-acquired infections. However, these positive results should be considered with caution because statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in 5 of the 7 meta-analyses. Conclusions Some evidence appears to support the benefit of l-arginine supplementation for reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive adults and reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired infections and the length of stay in the hospital for surgical patients. Given the limitations of the included studies, interpretations should be made with caution. l l "
"Objective The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to compare the effect of 2 multimodal exercise-based physical therapy interventions (one with and one without whole-body vibration [WBV] therapy plus traction) on pain and disability in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 2 distinct samples. One sample was from the Focus on Therapeutic Outcomes Inc. (FOTO) group (n = 55, age 55.1 ± 19.0 years), and the other was the Illinois Back Institute (IBI) (n = 70, age 47.5 ± 13.4 years). Both groups of patients had NSCLBP for more than 3 months and a pain numeric rating scale (NRS) score of ≥7. Both groups received treatment consisting of flexibility or stretching exercises, core stability training, functional training, and postural exercises and strengthening exercises. However, the IBI group also received WBV plus traction. NSCLBP was measured before and after therapeutic trials using the NRS for pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results The NRS scores were significantly improved in both groups, decreasing by 2 points in the FOTO group and by 5 points in the IBI group. The ODI scores were significantly improved in both groups; the FOTO group score improved by 9 points and the IBI group improved by 22 points. Conclusions The results of this preliminary study suggest that NPS and ODI scores statistically improved for both NSCLBP groups receiving multimodal care. However, the group that included WBV therapy plus traction in combination with multimodal care had greater clinical results. This study had several limitations making it difficult to generalize the results from this study sample to the entire population. "
"Background Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a growing health problem and a leading cause of disability and loss of independence in older adults. It is usually caused by age-related degenerative narrowing of the spinal canals leading to compression and ischemia of the spinal nerves and symptoms of neurogenic claudication. Limited walking ability is the dominant functional impairment caused by LSS. Animal studies suggest increased blood flow to the spinal nerves and spinal cord with superficial paraspinal electrical stimulation. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of paraspinal transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied while walking on walking ability in patients with LSS. Methods/Design We propose to conduct a 2-arm double-blinded (participant and assessor) randomized controlled trial. We will recruit individuals who have limited walking ability due to degenerative LSS from hospital specialists, community physicians, and chiropractors located in the city of Toronto, Canada. Eligible consenting participants will be randomly assigned to either paraspinal TENS or placebo paraspinal TENS applied while walking. The primary outcome will be walking distance measured during a single self-paced walking test. We will calculate the differences in proportions among participants in both groups who achieve at least a 30% improvement in walking distance from baseline using Pearson χ2 test with 95% confidence intervals. χ 2 χ 2 Discussion Effective nonoperative interventions for LSS are unknown. Interventions that can improve blood flow to the spinal nerves while walking may increase walking ability in this population. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a low-cost intervention that may have the potential to achieve this objective. To our knowledge, this study will be the first clinical trial to assess the effects of TENS on walking ability of patients with LSS. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02592642 "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to describe the chiropractic management of a student athlete with postconcussion syndrome. Clinical Features A 14-year-old male hockey player presented to a chiropractic clinic with postconcussion symptoms 13 days after his initial injury. He experienced an occipital headache with a pain rating of 8/10, upset stomach, blurry vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, a “foggy feeling,” difficulty with concentration, difficulty with memory, fatigue, confusion, drowsiness, and irritability. Prior to seeing the doctor of chiropractic, the patient was monitored by a medical doctor, and the care he had been receiving was in accordance with current concussion guidelines. At the time of presentation to the chiropractic clinic, he had failed to progress toward return to play, and his computerized neurocognitive testing scores had not improved. Intervention and Outcome Chiropractic manipulative therapy, myofascial release, instrument-assisted soft tissue technique, and therapeutic exercises were provided over 5 treatments spanning a 20-day period. The patient followed up each treatment with ImPACT testing. At the conclusion of the treatments, the patient’s computerized neurocognitive testing scores had improved, and the patient was returned to play. Conclusion This case demonstrates the improvement of postconcussion syndrome in a 14-year-old male hockey player under chiropractic management. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate data on concussion prevalence in 1 geographic location and to identify which sports have a higher prevalence of concussion in the Marion County, Florida, school district. Methods High school athletic trainers in Marion County, Florida, are required to compile statistics related to number of participants and concussions sustained in the county school district during each season. They provided the data for the 2011-2012 school year to independent analysts with the permission of the athletic director. The study evaluated 3689 student-athletes (2102 male, 1587 female), and 34 concussions (24 male, 10 female) were reported. Concussions were self-reported by the athletes and diagnosed by trainers on field or by follow-up after physician referral. Consent was included in consent to participate in interscholastic athletics, and all athletes enrolling in a sport during the 2011-2012 academic year were included regardless of participation level. Number of participants and concussions sustained was calculated per 100 participants for each sport and in total for 1 year. Results The percentages of concussions per sport were as follows: basketball, 1.83%; cheerleading, 0.40%; football, 2.83%; soccer, 1.84%; track and field, 0.44%; and wrestling, 0.70%. Ten additional sports were included in the study but had no reported concussions. Total prevalence for the district was 0.922% (1.14% male, 0.63% female) during a 1-year period. Conclusion The concussion prevalence in this district during the 2011-2012 school year was just under 1%. The sport reporting the highest prevalence was football, followed by soccer. Females reported a higher rate of concussions than males in sports played by both male and female participants. This highlights the need to minimize risk for concussion, especially in noncollision contact sports, and in female athletes. "
"Objective Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a well-known inflammatory cytokine in the pathological development of various human diseases, its physiological roles are not widely understood nor appreciated. The molecular mechanisms underlying spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) remain elusive. The relationship between TNF and SMT is unclear. Thus, we performed this literature review to better understand TNF physiology and its potential relationship with SMT, and we propose a novel mechanism by which SMT may achieve clinical benefits by using certain beneficial features of TNF. Methods We searched several databases for relevant articles published between 1975 and 2015 and then reexamined the studies from current immunophysiological perspectives. Results The history and recent progresses in TNF physiology research were explored. Conflicting reports on the relationship between TNF and SMT were identified. Based on the newly discovered interaction between TNF and regulatory T cells, we proposed a putative biphasic TNF response to SMT, which may resolve the conflicts in the reported observations and interpretations. Conclusion The current literature about TNF informed our discussion of new physiological roles for TNF, which may help to better understand the physiological effects of SMT. "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe osteoarthritis and internal derangement of the shoulder in a collegiate softball player. Clinical Features A 25-year-old female softball athlete presented with a history of chronic right shoulder pain. A thorough clinical examination and multiple imaging studies were performed. Osteoarthritis was demonstrated on radiographs, and ligamentous and rotator cuff tendon tears were displayed on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient’s treatment plan included full spine manipulation, cold laser therapy, kinesiotaping, stretching, and neuromuscular reeducation of the right shoulder. Interventions and Outcomes The patient reported a decrease in symptoms after 1 month, although treatment was sporadic because of poor patient compliance. Conclusion Osteoarthritis and internal derangement may occur in overhead-throwing athletes, and correct imaging is needed for timely and accurate diagnoses. Following a timely diagnosis, the young patient in this case had a good recovery with multimodal chiropractic care. "
"Objective Researchers often use Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores to classify recovery status in whiplash patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the optimal cutoff point score for the NDI as a mechanism for differentiating recovery from nonrecovery after whiplash. Methods Subjects (N = 123) who had previously sustained whiplash injuries were recruited from 12 clinics. Subjects rated themselves as being recovered (36%) or nonrecovered (64%). This state variable was compared with their NDI score as test variable using the receiver operating characteristic statistic. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimized cutoff points were computed for the whole group and also dichotomized for sex and age. Results The mean NDI score for the recovered group was 7.8. It was 27.1 for the nonrecovered group. The cutoff point that optimized sensitivity and specificity for the whole group was an NDI score of 15. For women, it was 19; for older persons, it was 21. Conclusion The optimal NDI score cutoff point for differentiating the recovery state after whiplash is 15. Misclassification errors are likely when using lower values. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a case where calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD) simulated osteoarthritis of the knee. Clinical Features A 78-year-old woman had a 2-week history of severe right knee pain accompanied by mild swelling. The onset was sudden and did not involve a history of trauma or previous injury to the right knee. Inspection and palpation revealed pain along the medial joint line and marked difficulty ambulating. Results of Lachman’s test, anterior drawer test, and posterior sag sign were negative upon orthopedic assessment. Diagnostic imaging was performed and showed degenerative changes with diffuse calcification of the fibrocartilage and hyaline articular cartilage within the knee joint and the medial collateral ligament consistent with the appearance of CPPD crystal deposition. Intervention and Outcome Low-level laser therapy was performed to the affected medial joint line of the knee, and knee stabilization exercises were given. Lower Extremity Function Scale changed from 34% to 60% after 4 weeks of care. Conclusion Although knee osteoarthritis is much more common than knee CPPD, it is important to consider both diagnoses in elderly patients who present with unilateral knee pain. Diagnosis should be based on clinical presentation, history, and radiographic or histological means to ensure accuracy and proper diagnosis. "
"Objective Two whiplash severity grading systems have been developed: Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders (QTF-WAD) and the Croft grading system. The majority of clinical studies to date have used the modified grading system published by the QTF-WAD in 1995 and have demonstrated some ability to predict outcome. But most studies include only injuries of lower severity (grades 1 and 2), preventing a broader interpretation. The purpose of this study was assess the ability of these grading systems to predict clinical outcome within the context of a broader injury spectrum. Methods This study evaluated both grading systems for their ability to predict the bivalent outcome, recovery, within a sample of 118 whiplash patients who were part of a previous case-control designed study. Of these, 36% (controls) had recovered, and 64% (cases) had not recovered. The discrete bivariate distribution between recovery status and whiplash grade was analyzed using the 2-tailed cross-tabulation statistics. Results Applying the criteria of the original 1993 Croft grading system, the subset comprised 1 grade 1 injury, 32 grade 2 injuries, 53 grade 3 injuries, and 32 grade 4 injuries. Applying the criteria of the modified (QTF-WAD) grading system, there were 1 grade 1 injury, 89 grade 2 injuries, and 28 grade 3 injuries. Both whiplash grading systems correlated negatively with recovery; that is, higher severity grades predicted a lower probability of recovery, and statistically significant correlations were observed in both, but the Croft grading system substantially outperformed the QTF-WAD system on this measure. Conclusions The Croft grading system for whiplash injury severity showed a better predictive measure for recovery status from whiplash injuries as compared with the QTF-WAD grading system. "
"Objective Because of previously published recommendations to modify the Neck Disability Index (NDI), we evaluated the responsiveness and dimensionality of the NDI within a population of adult whiplash-injured subjects. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the responsiveness and dimensionality of the NDI within a population of adult whiplash-injured subjects. Methods Subjects who had sustained whiplash injuries of grade 2 or higher completed an NDI questionnaire. There were 123 subjects (55% female, of which 36% had recovered and 64% had chronic symptoms. NDI subscales were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, considering only the subscales and, secondly, using sex as an 11th variable. The subscales were also tested with multiple linear regression modeling using the total score as a target variable. Results When considering only the 10 NDI subscales, only a single factor emerged, with an eigenvalue of 5.4, explaining 53.7% of the total variance. Strong correlation (> .55) (P < .0001) between all variables was found. Multiple linear regression modeling revealed high internal consistency with all coefficients reaching significance (P < .0001). The 4 NDI subscales exerting the greatest effect were, in decreasing order, Sleeping, Lifting, Headaches, and Pain Intensity. P P P P Conclusion A 2-factor model of the NDI is not justified based on our results, and in this population of whiplash subjects, the NDI was unidimensional, demonstrating high internal consistency and supporting the original validation study of Vernon and Mior.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate effects of a single massage session on hand grip strength and endurance after isometric exercise in healthy young men under controlled conditions. Methods A total of 44 healthy young men from a university population participated in the study. They were randomized to receive either massage or passive movement intervention. Hand grip endurance and hand grip strength in both groups were recorded using a Jamar hand grip dynamometer and a digital chronometer before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and paired t test as well as independent t test. t t t t Results Pre-and postmean hand grip endurance times for the massage group were 38.4 ± 12 and 46.5 ± 13 seconds (P < .001), and hand grip strength values were 43 ± 5.6 and 45.7 ± 5.3 kg (P = .077). Pre-and postmean hand grip endurance times for the passive movement group were 33 ± 12.3 and 31.9 ± 10.7 seconds (P = .513), and hand grip strength values were 42.8 ± 6 and 42.9 ± 5.6 kg (P = .854). P P P P P P P P Conclusion Immediately after 1 session of massage to the forearm and hand, the grip endurance improved in a group of healthy young men. However, passive movement of the upper limb for 1 session did not enhance grip performance. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient who presented with symptoms of exercise-induced compartment syndrome and was later referred for bilateral fasciotomy surgery. Clinical Features A 21-year-old patient presented for chiropractic care with the inability to run due to foot paresthesia and weakness. An exertion test and compartment pressure test diagnosed exercise-induced compartment syndrome. Exertion test and compartment pressure test were used to identify and diagnose exercise-induced compartment syndrome. Intervention and Outcome The patient was diagnosed with exercise-induced compartment syndrome. He was treated conservatively and referred for additional testing. The orthopedic surgeon requested that 12 weeks of conservative care be provided prior to testing; treatment consisted of chiropractic care and rehabilitation exercises. Following the 12 weeks of treatment, the patient did not significantly respond to conservative care. A compartment pressure test confirmed the initial diagnosis of exercise-induced compartment syndrome. The patient underwent a unilateral fasciotomy surgery and recovered fully. Following the surgery, the patient returned to the chiropractic clinic with the same presentation in the contralateral leg. The same protocol of management resulted in the same outcome. Two years after surgical intervention, the patient continues to maintain an active lifestyle, able to run 2 to 3 miles per day without any exacerbations or symptomatology. Conclusion Clinical awareness, a detailed history, and thorough examination with reproduction of symptomatology are necessary to form a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for these patients. Therefore, multidisciplinary medical communication would prove to be the most beneficial approach for the patient. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the features of an unusual presentation of fibrous dysplasia. Clinical Features A 53-year-old woman had low back pain and numbness in the anterior upper left thigh that started 3 years earlier after a fall. She experienced pain during active lumbar flexion and extension range of motion. Radiographic examination demonstrated an oval geographic osteolytic lesion in the left ilium and abnormal trabecular architecture with variable-sized osteolytic lesions and both ill-defined and well-defined borders along the sacroiliac joint margin. Intervention and Outcome Because of the aggressive osteolytic appearance, magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis with gadolinium contrast was obtained for additional characterization of the lesions. There were 3 additional mixed signal lesions located within the left femoral neck and extending to the greater trochanter that enhanced with contrast. Because of the suspicion of malignancy, needle biopsy was performed. The pathologic findings in combination with the radiographic appearance confirmed the diagnosis of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Conclusion This case demonstrated a rare aggressive appearance of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia located in the left innominate and the left proximal femur that prompted a diagnostic imaging workup and biopsy for suspected skeletal malignancy. These lesions may require careful evaluation by an experienced team of physicians, radiologists, and pathologists to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. "
"Purpose The purpose of this case series is to report on changes in pain levels experienced by 69 postsurgical continued pain patients who received Cox Technic Flexion Distraction (CTFD). Methods Fifteen doctors of chiropractic collected retrospective data from the records of the postsurgical continued pain patients seen in their clinic from February to July 2012 who were treated with CTFD, which is a type of chiropractic distraction spinal manipulation. Informed consent was obtained from all patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study. Data recorded included subjective patient pain levels at the end of the treatments provided and at 24 months following the last treatment. Results Fifty-four (81%) of the patients showed greater than 50% reduction in pain levels at the end of the last treatment, and 13 (19%) showed less than 50% improvement of pain levels at the end of active care (mean, 49 days and 11 treatments). At 24-month follow-up, of 56 patients available, 44 (78.6%) had continued pain relief of greater than 50% and 10 (18%) reported 50% or less relief. The mean percentage of relief at the end of active care was 71.6 (SD, 23.2) and at 24 months was 70 (SD, 25). At 24 months after active care, 24 patients (43%) had not sought further care, and 32 required further treatment consisting of chiropractic manipulation for 17 (53%), physical therapy, exercise, injections, and medication for 9 (28%), and further surgery for 5 (16%). Conclusion Greater than 50% pain relief following CTFD chiropractic distraction spinal manipulation was seen in 81% of postsurgical patients receiving a mean of 11 visits over a 49-day period of active care.

"Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically evaluate randomized controlled trials of spinal manipulation (SM) vs sham manipulation in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. Methods Four electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2015 to identify all relevant trials. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched. All data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Back Review Group Risk of Bias tool. Results Nine randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review, and 4 were found to be eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Participants in the SM group had improved symptoms compared with participants receiving sham treatment (standardized mean difference = − 0.36; 95% confidence interval, − 0.59 to − 0.12). The majority of studies were of low risk of bias; however, several of the studies were small, the practitioner could not be blinded, and some studies did not conduct intention-to-treat analysis and had a high level of dropouts. Conclusion There is some evidence that SM has specific treatment effects and is more effective at reducing nonspecific low back pain when compared with an effective sham intervention. However, given the small number of studies included in this analysis, we should be cautious of making strong inferences based on these results. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management of a patient with pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Clinical Features A pregnant 35-year-old woman experienced insidious moderate to severe pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain and leg pain at 32 weeks’ gestation. Pain limited her endurance capacity for walking and sitting. Clinical testing revealed a left sacroiliac joint functional disturbance and myofascial trigger points reproducing back and leg pain. Intervention and Outcome A diagnosis of pregnancy-related low back pain and pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain was made. The patient was treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation, soft tissue therapy, exercises, and ergonomic advice in 13 visits over 6 weeks. She consulted her obstetrician for her weekly obstetric visits. At the end of treatment, her low back pain reduced from 7 to 2 on a 0-10 numeric pain scale rating. Functional activities reported such as walking, sitting, and traveling comfortably in a car had improved. Conclusion This patient with pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain improved in pain and function after chiropractic treatment and usual obstetric management. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of novel variations to the way cervical flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP) studies are conducted and the feasibility of using cervical axial rotation as an alternative objective measure of cervical pain/dysfunction. Methods Electromyographic data were collected from cervical paraspinal muscles of 5 participants with neck pain and 5 asymptomatic controls. Cervical FRP was conducted as reported in the literature with the participants seated, except that they started with the head fully flexed instead of being erect. Data were also collected with participants laying prone, starting with their head hanging over the edge of the table. Additional data were collected from cervical paraspinal and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles while the seated participants rotated their head fully to the right and left. Ratios were obtained for each type of test by dividing the electromyographic amplitude when muscles were most active by that when they were relaxed or in contralateral rotation. Results In each case, the ratio was higher for the controls than for those with neck pain, suggesting that any of the 4 methods could be used to distinguish between 2 groups. The ratios were most pronounced from SCMs during axial rotation. There appeared to be a negative relationship between pain level and the ratios obtained from each method. Conclusion The findings from this small study are encouraging for all methods used, with axial rotation using SCMs appearing to be the most promising. These results indicate that larger, powered studies are warranted. "
"Objective The purpose of this case study is to describe the role of sonographic examination in the initial evaluation of an angioleiomyoma and to discuss the characteristic findings associated with this soft tissue mass. Clinical Features A 52-year-old woman presented with a large, tender, erythematous mass on the anterolateral aspect of her right knee. Sonographic examination revealed a highly vascular mass within the subcutaneous tissues. Differential considerations included benign soft tissues masses such as angioleiomyoma and hemangioma. Intervention and Outcomes Surgical consultation was recommended. Excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. Conclusion Although ultrasonographic findings of a superficial soft tissue mass may be nonspecific, when a highly vascular, well-defined, slow-growing mass is present, angioleiomyoma should be included in the differential diagnosis. "
"Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management and referral of a patient with rib pain who was subsequently diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. Clinical Features A 65-year-old woman presented with radiating rib pain to a chiropractic clinic. She was treated with a 2-week course of conservative care. On follow-up evaluation, she reported a deep ache over her lower ribs, wrapping around to her abdomen. Palpation under the anterior rib cage reproduced her pain, and she also had a positive Murphy Sign. She was referred for an abdominal ultrasonography. Intervention and Outcome Ultrasonography showed a 12-cm solid vascular mass of the right kidney. Further imaging studies using computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the ultrasonography findings. She was referred to a cancer center for staging of the cancer and subsequent surgical treatment. The involved tissue, as well as the kidney and part of the inferior vena cava, was removed, and the pathology report determined that the mass was clear cell carcinoma. Conclusion This case describes an unusual presentation of a patient with rib pain that had previously undiagnosed renal cancer. Referral by her doctor of chiropractic resulted in detection of the tumor and treatment. "
"Objective The aim of this study was to look for differences between patients with an increased pain response as compared with those with a decreased pain response. Methods Data were collected from consecutive new patients with lumbar or lumbopelvic pain in a chiropractic clinic. A pelvic tilt exercise was included in the initial examination, and pain response was noted. Analysis was made of pain and disability severity, as well as symptom location, chronicity, and other characteristics, before and after a course of chiropractic care. Results Patients with an increased pain response to pelvic tilt (n = 12) had higher levels of pain and disability at baseline than patients without (n = 34). There were no between-group differences in other aspects of their complaints; in age, sex, or body mass; or in the types of care they received (eg, manipulation, stretching, exercise instruction). On the average, both groups of patients showed improvement with chiropractic care, and there was no detectable difference in improvement between groups. Conclusions This study found that patients experiencing pain in response to a pelvic tilt maneuver may have a poorer precare status than patients with a decreased pain response. "
"Objective The purpose of this case series is to report on symptomatic and quality of life (QoL) changes in 7 older adult chiropractic patients who were receiving care using Activator Methods Chiropractic Technique (AMCT). Clinical Features Seven patients were selected from 2 chiropractic offices in Auckland, New Zealand. Patients were included if they were older adults receiving AMCT care and for whom at least 2 QoL assessments had been performed. The patients, aged 69-80 years, primarily received care for a variety of musculoskeletal complaints. Intervention and Outcomes The patients reported improvements in their presenting complaints as well as a number of nonmusculoskeletal symptoms. Each patient demonstrated clinical improvements in their RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) results. The average improvement in QoL measured using a SF-36 questionnaire was 8.0 points in the physical component and 4.1 points in the mental component. Four cases had a second progress evaluation using the SF-36 and showed an overall improvement of 5.2 in the physical and 9.8 in the mental components from baseline. Conclusion This case series describes an improvement in QoL, as measured by the SF-36 instrument, as well as subjectively reported improvements in both musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal symptoms in 7 older adults receiving chiropractic care.

"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the presentation of cellulitis in a 16-month-old boy to a chiropractic clinic. Clinical Features The patient presented with nontraumatic, sudden onset of nonpurulent erythema on the right knee. A plain film radiograph of the knee showed a 40-mm thickening of the anterior knee. A diagnosis of cellulitis was rendered based on the presentation of the rapidly spreading erythema and radiographically confirmed findings. Intervention and Outcome The patient was immediately referred to the local emergency room. The patient was hospitalized, treated with clindamycin and amoxicillin for 3 days, and then discharged. The patient’s pediatrician discontinued clindamycin treatment at the posthospitalization follow-up. Two weeks after treatment was discontinued, the patient was diagnosed with recurrent cellulitis. Conclusion This case demonstrated that for this young patient with cellulitis of the knee, timely recognition and referral, together with patient or parent education and immediate treatment, were essential to a successful outcome. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of end range loading (ERL) vs harmonic technique (HT) on patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). Method Fourteen volunteer patients with LBP were randomly assigned to 2 groups based on a blocked randomization method with 7 patients in the HT group and 7 patients in the ERL group. The patients received 10 sessions of treatment for 5 sessions per week. Pain intensity and disability score were recorded using the numeric pain scale and Roland-Morris Disability questionnaire (RMQ), respectively, before and after the treatment period. Results Although pain intensity (P = .02) and the RMQ score (P = .03) decreased in the HT technique group, no statistically significant change was found in the ERL group for the RMQ score (P > .05). The effect size for HT was .6 and .3 for numeric pain scale and RMQ, respectively. P P P P P P Conclusion This preliminary study showed that pain intensity and disability improved in subjects with chronic LBP in the HT group. More investigations with larger sample size are needed to clarify these findings. "
"Objective This case report describes the diagnosis of a malignant brain tumor in a patient requesting chiropractic care for headaches after a motor vehicle accident. Clinical Features A 30-year-old man presented with numbness and tingling in all extremities, lower extremity muscle weakness, and a recent increase in headaches with the loss of ability to concentrate. He was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision approximately 4 months before the onset of symptoms. Examination showed slow gait with a lack of arm swing, bilateral hip flexors and knee extensors were all graded as 4/5 on muscle testing, and cranial nerve examination was unremarkable with the exception of 2 beats of nystagmus on left lateral eye movement. Because of these findings and a family history of multiple sclerosis, the patient was referred for a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Intervention and Outcome Imaging showed a craniocervical junction mass centered at the floor of the fourth ventricle with obstruction of foramina and marked impingement on the medulla. A posterior fossa craniotomy and tumor removal procedure was performed by a neurosurgeon, followed by 34 sessions of radiation therapy. The final diagnosis was a grade II glioma with features of ependymoma. Conclusions This report describes the clinical presentation, examination, and medical management of a 30-year-old man presenting to a chiropractic practice with an unsuspected malignant brain tumor.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the demographics, presenting complaints, and health history of new patients seeking treatment at a free chiropractic clinic within a university health center. Methods A retrospective analysis of patient files from 2008 to 2009 was performed for a free student chiropractic clinic in the Buffalo, NY, area. Demographics, presenting complaints, and health history of new patients seeking treatment were recorded. Results There were 343 new chiropractic patient files. Most patients were between the ages of 18 and 30 years (n = 304, 88%) with an almost equal distribution of men (n = 163, 48%) and women (n = 180, 52%). The patients were mostly single (n = 300, 87%). Patients self-reported that their case histories excluded a current medical diagnosis (n = 261, 76%), previous history of disease (n = 216, 63%), allergies (n = 240, 70%), previous surgical procedures (n = 279, 81%), and medication use (n = 250, 73%). The frequencies of spinal complaints were as follows: lumbar spine, n = 176 (51%); cervical spine, n = 78 (23%); and thoracic spine, n = 44 (13%). Maintenance care, headaches, and spine-related upper and lower extremities complaints accounted for the other 13% of patients treated. Half were chronic (n = 172, 50%), and a third were acute (n=108, 31%). Patients averaged 6 chiropractic visits, with 88% having 11 visits or less. Conclusion This study found that new patients seeking care at a free student chiropractic clinic within a university health center in the Buffalo area mainly consisted of young single adults, with chronic lumbar spine complaints with few comorbidities.

"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the chiropractic management of an 8-year-old girl with nonorganic, primary nocturnal enuresis. Clinical Features An 8-year-old female patient presented to a chiropractic clinic with persistent nighttime bedwetting. The patient experienced enuresis, on average, 7 nights per week. The patient presented with no other comorbidities or complaints, such as low back or pelvic pain. Intervention and Outcomes Chiropractic treatment included high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation of the left sacroiliac joint over 3 visits. Follow-up at 3 months revealed only 3 subsequent episodes of nocturnal enuresis. Conclusion This patient reported the resolution of nonorganic, primary nocturnal enuresis after receiving a series of side-posture chiropractic manipulations of the left sacroiliac joint. "
"Objectives The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of over-the-counter treatments—ThermaCare HeatWraps (chemical reaction to produce heat above the skin), Icy Hot Patch, and Icy Hot Cream (topically applied menthol)—on skin and deep tissue temperature. Methods This was a longitudinal crossover study. On each of 3 days, a ThermaCare HeatWrap, Icy Hot Cream, or Icy Hot Patch was applied randomly over the quadriceps muscle in 15 healthy volunteers with normal body mass. Skin and muscle temperature and blood flow were measured by laser flowmetry every 15 minutes for 2 hours. Results After 2 hours, mean temperature decreased by 2.1°C (7.0%; P = .02) in skin and 1.0°C (2.9%; P = .01) in muscle with Icy Hot Cream. Icy Hot Patch decreased skin and muscle temperature by 1.7°C (5.4%; P = .03) and 1.3°C (3.8%; P = .01), respectively. In contrast, ThermaCare raised skin and muscle temperature by 7.8°C (25.8%; P = .001) and 2.7°C (7.7%; P = .002), respectively; both were significantly warmer with ThermaCare vs either Icy Hot product (all P < .007). Icy Hot products produced a net decrease in skin blood flow (Cream: 56.7 flux [39.3%; P = .003]; Patch: 19.1 flux [16.7%; P = .045]). Muscle blood flow decreased with the Patch (6.7 flux [7.0%; P = .02]). After a period of fluctuations, Icy Hot Cream produced a net increase vs baseline of 7.0 flux (16.9%; P = .02). ThermaCare more than doubled blood flow in skin (83.3 flux [109.7%; P = .0003]) and muscle (25.1 flux [148.5%; P = .004]). P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P Conclusions In this group of 15 healthy volunteers, ThermaCare HeatWraps provided the greatest degree of tissue warming and increase in tissue blood flow.

"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe 2 patients with coronary artery disease presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms to a chiropractic clinic. Clinical Features A 48-year-old male new patient had thoracic spine pain aggravated by physical exertion. A 61-year-old man under routine care for low back pain experienced a secondary complaint of acute chest pain during a reevaluation. Intervention and Outcome In both cases, the patients were strongly encouraged to consult their medical physician and were subsequently diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Following their diagnoses, each patient underwent surgical angioplasty procedures with stenting. Conclusion Patients may present for chiropractic care with what appears to be musculoskeletal chest pain when the pain may be generating from coronary artery disease necessitating medical and possibly emergency care. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to examine the self-report of experiences, attitudes, and perceived educational needs of American Chiropractic Association members regarding practice in integrated health care settings. Methods This was a descriptive observational study of the American Chiropractic Association members. Participants completed an electronic survey reporting their current participation and interest in chiropractic integrated practice. Results The survey was completed in 2011 by 1142 respondents, for a response rate of 11.8%. The majority of respondents (82.9%) did not currently practice in an integrated setting, whereas 17.1% did. Those practicing in various integrated medical settings reported delivering a range of diagnostic, therapeutic, and case management services. Participation in administrative and scholarly activities was less common. Respondents not practicing in integrated settings reported being interested in delivering a very similar array of clinical services. Doctors of chiropractic practicing in hospital or outpatient medical facilities reported frequent engagement in interprofessional collaboration. Both nonintegrated and integrated respondents reported very similar educational interests on a range of clinical topics. Conclusion The findings of this survey provide insight into the experiences, participation, and interests in integrated clinical practice for members of the American Chiropractic Association. "
"Objective The objective of this case series is to describe manual manipulative therapy with exercise for 3 patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the great toe. Clinical Features Three patients, a 32-year-old man, a 55-year-old woman, and a 49-year-old woman, had great toe pain of 8, 1, and 2 years, respectively. Each had a palpable exostosis, a benign outgrowth of bone projecting outward from the bone surface, and decreased dorsiflexion with a hard end-feel. Intervention and Outcome Manual manipulative therapy with exercise, the Brantingham protocol, was used with patients receiving 6, 9, and 12 treatments over 6 weeks. Specific outcome measures for hallux rigidus and the foot were chosen to document the effects of this intervention including digital inclinometry, the lower extremity functional scale, the foot functional index, overall therapy effectiveness and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Each patient had an increase in range of motion that surpassed the minimal clinically important change, an increase in the overall therapy effectiveness and a decrease in the foot functional index that surpassed the minimally clinically important difference. Most importantly for the patients, each reported a decrease in both usual and worst pain on the VAS that exceeded the minimally clinically important difference of 20 to 30 mm. Conclusion The 3 patients reported decreased pain measured by the VAS, increased range of motion and minimally clinically important difference in 3 other outcome measures. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the methods proposed to conduct a full randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of mobilization with movement on shoulder functionality in older adults with shoulder dysfunction. Methods A pilot, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was carried out with 44 older adults (83.9±8.2 years) with shoulder dysfunction in 3 nursing homes in Toledo, Spain. Participants were recruited through information sessions and were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The control group (n = 22) intervention consisted of a physical therapy standard protocol proposed by the Spanish Rheumatology Society. Techniques based on Mulligan’s concepts of mobilization with movement were added to the standard protocol for the experimental group (n = 22) intervention. Interventions took place 3 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks and were performed by 2 experienced therapists. Main outcomes were recruitment rates, participation and adherence to interventions, assessment procedures, and the implementation of mobilization with movement. Clinical outcomes were shoulder functionality, active glenohumeral range of motion, and pain intensity. Data were collected at baseline, after each group intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after finishing interventions. Results All the participants accepted to be randomized. Participation rates were 97.7% for the experimental group and 95.5% for the control group. The analysis of variance did not show any statistically significant difference between treatment groups for any of the variables (all P values for the group effect were greater than .36) or a change of the difference between groups over time (all P values for the time-treatment interactions were greater than .3). P P P P Conclusion The research methods tested in this pilot study offer a suitable foundation to conduct a full clinical trial. "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to present a presumptive case of ankylosing spondylitis with late stage progression that simulated osteoblastic metastasis in a patient with a history of prostate carcinoma. Clinical Features A 67-year-old white man presented to a chiropractic clinic complaining of severe and worsening acute low back pain and right foot “numbness.” Further questioning also revealed a history of prostate carcinoma. Intervention and Outcome Imaging examination revealed a sclerotic pedicle and increased uptake of radiopharmaceutical on a nuclear medicine bone scan highly suggestive of osteoblastic skeletal metastasis. Further evaluation, however, revealed that the bone sclerosis was not the result of skeletal metastasis, but more consistent with a seronegative spondyloarthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis. Conclusion This report describes a presumptive case of ankylosing spondylitis simulating skeletal metastasis in a patient with a past medical history of prostate cancer. This atypical presentation illustrates the inherent uncertainty of diagnosis and how that uncertainty can be challenging in clinical practice. It also reinforces that it is critical for healthcare providers to consider a wide spectrum of differential diagnoses to avoid misdiagnoses and inappropriate interventions. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) who was initially misdiagnosed and treated for a hip flexor strain. Clinical Features A 36-year-old male patient presented with insidious onset of progressive anterior right hip and groin pain of 7 years' duration. He was diagnosed with a right-sided hip flexor muscle strain and was discharged from care 1 month later. The patient then returned to the office 8 years later for treatment of unrelated lower back pain. This time, the doctor of chiropractic learned that the patient was misdiagnosed years before. The patient's past radiographs in fact revealed FAI, including severe hip joint osteoarthritis on the right and mild osteoarthritis on the left. As a result, the patient had undergone right hip joint replacement surgery. Recent radiographs also revealed FAI in the contralateral hip. Intervention and Outcome After investigating for FAI, the doctor of chiropractic was able to identify through symptomatology, history, physical examination, and radiographs the presence of FAI in the patient's left hip. An “active surveillance” approach is being taken. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of an increasing awareness of FAI, as doctors of chiropractic are frequently the primary contact for patients with this condition. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the diagnostic value of ultrasonography (US) in a patient with injury to the lateral ligaments of the ankle with concomitant ankle joint osteoarthritis and anterior impingement. Clinical Features A 28-year-old male had a history of an inversion injury of the left ankle. Diagnostic US of the left ankle using an 8- to 15-MHz linear array transducer demonstrated a full thickness tear of the anterior talofibular ligament, partial thickness tearing of the calcaneofibular ligament, and laxity of the ankle with varus stress testing. In addition, US was able to demonstrate degeneration of the ankle and talonavicular joints and anterior impingement with dorsiflexion. Osteoarthritic changes were confirmed with radiography. Other US findings included remote deltoid ligamentous complex injury, multiple sites of tenosynovitis, and a large ankle joint effusion with synovial hypertrophy and synovitis. Intervention and Outcome Using US, an accurate diagnosis was established with respect to the pathology and functional impairments of the patient’s ankle. Conclusion This case report exemplifies the value and utility of US in diagnosing derangement in ligamentous, tendinous, articular, and osseous injuries of the ankle. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to describe chiropractic treatment of 14 patients who presented with signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). Methods This is a retrospective case series of 14 patients, including 13 adults and 1 child. The majority of these patients were undergoing chiropractic care for spine-related conditions when they presented with additional TMD signs and symptoms. They were evaluated and treated with Activator Methods International published protocols relative to the temporomandibular joint before the addition of treatment to the suprahyoid muscles. Results All pre- and postadjustment assessments were recorded using a numeric pain scale. The resulting average showed a reduction in the patients’ pain scores from the initial visit of 8.3 ± 1.6 to the last visit at 1.4 ± 1.1 with an 80.9% ± 15.4% improvement. The average number of visits was 13.6 ± 8.2. Conclusion All patients selected for this case series showed a reduction of temporomandibular dysfunction symptoms. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of manual manipulations targeting the lumbar spine and/or sacroiliac joint on concentric knee extension and flexion forces. Torque production was measured during isometric and isokinetic contractions. Methods This was a randomized, controlled, single-blind crossover design with 21 asymptomatic, college-aged subjects who had never received spinal manipulation. During 2 separate sessions, subjects’ peak torques were recorded while performing maximal voluntary contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer. Isometric knee extension and flexion were recorded at 60° of knee flexion, in addition to isokinetic measurements obtained at 60°/s and 180°/s. Baseline measurements were acquired before either treatment form of lumbosacral manipulation or sham manipulation, followed by identical peak torque measurements within 5 and 20 minutes posttreatment. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance. Results A statistically significant difference did not occur between the effects of lumbosacral manipulation or the sham manipulation in the percentage changes of knee extension and flexion peak torques at 5 and 20 minutes posttreatment. Similar, nonsignificant results were observed in the overall percentage changes of isometric contractions (spinal manipulation 4.0 ± 9.5 vs sham 1.2 ± 6.3, P = .067), isokinetic contractions at 60°/s (spinal manipulation − 4.0 ± 14.2 vs sham − 0.3 ± 8.2, P = .34), and isokinetic contractions at 180°/s (spinal manipulation − 1.4 ± 13.9 vs sham − 5.5 ± 20.0, P = .18). P P P P P P Conclusion The results of the current study suggest that spinal manipulation does not yield an immediate strength-enhancing effect about the knee in healthy, college-aged subjects when measured with isokinetic dynamometry. "
"Objective Adhesive capsulitis has been suggested as an adverse effect of vaccine administration into the shoulder area. The purpose of this case series is to report 3 cases of acute onset of adhesive capsulitis following pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. Clinical Features Patients reported painful shoulder and limited motion following routine vaccination. After clinical examination, a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis was noted. Intervention and Outcome All 3 patients were treated conservatively with physical therapy (active ranges of motion and active-assisted motion), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and activity modification with eventual resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Reports implicating vaccination with adhesive capsulitis are rare. This case series raises the awareness of pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations as possible causes of adhesive capsulitis that appear to respond to standard treatment. Although vaccines are of tremendous importance in the prevention of serious illness, we emphasize the importance of administering them at the appropriate depth and location for each patient. "
"Objective This study evaluated the prevalence and morphologic characteristics of ponticulus posticus (PP) by using cervical 3-dimensional (3-D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan images. Methods This was a retrospective study conducted by selecting cervical 3-D CBCT images of 698 patients, which were examined for the presence and types of PP. Results In 257 patients, 438 PPs, complete or partial, bilateral or unilateral, were identified on the 698 cervical 3-D CBCT scans; therefore, the prevalence was 36.8%. Bilateral complete PP and partial PP were observed in 6.3% and 16.2% of subjects, respectively. There was a significant difference in the prevalence between males and females (P = .001) and between the right and left sides between males and females, but not between age groups. P P Conclusion Ponticulus posticus is a relatively common anomaly in this Turkish sample, which may have implications for those who perform clinical procedures on the upper cervical spine. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a case in which early detection and proper follow-up of spontaneous vertebral artery dissection led to satisfactory outcomes. Clinical Features A 34-year old white woman reported to a chiropractic clinic with a constant burning pain at the right side of her neck and shoulder with a limited ability to turn her head from side to side, periods of blurred vision, and muffled hearing. Dizziness, visual and auditory disturbances, and balance difficulty abated within 1 hour of onset and were not present at the time of evaluation. A pain drawing indicated burning pain in the suboccipital area, neck, and upper shoulder on the right and a pins and needles sensation on the dorsal surface of both forearms. Turning her head from side-to-side aggravated the pain, and the application of heat brought temporary relief. The Neck Disability Index score of 44 placed the patient’s pain in the most severe category. Intervention and Outcome The patient was not treated on the initial visit but was advised of the possibility of a vertebral artery or carotid artery dissection and was recommended to the emergency department for immediate evaluation. The patient declined but later was convinced by her chiropractor to present to the emergency department. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck and carotid arteries was performed showing that the left vertebral artery was hypoplastic and appeared to terminate at the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery. There was an abrupt moderately long segment of narrowing involving the right vertebral artery beginning near the junction of the V1 and V2 segments. The radiologist noted a concern regarding right vertebral artery dissection. Symptoms resolved and the patient was cleared of any medications but advised that if symptoms reoccurred she was to go for emergency care immediately. Conclusion Recognition and rapid response by the chiropractic physician provided the optimum outcome for this particular patient. "
"Objective The purpose of this paper is to present a position statement of best practices for the provision of a safe and high-quality pre-participation examination (PPE) and to provide recommendations on education requirements for doctors of chiropractic providing the PPE. Methods In 2014, the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians (ACBSP) Board of Directors identified a need to review and update the ACBSP position statements and practice guidelines in order to be current with evolving best practices. Twelve ACBSP certificants, 10 Diplomates of the ACBSP, and 2 Certified Chiropractic Sports Physicians, met in April 2015 to author a pre-participation position statement using an expert consensus process. Panel members excluded anyone with commercial conflicts of interest and included individuals with expertise in clinical sports medicine and the performance of PPEs. A literature review was performed and circulated in advance for use by the panel in addressing the topic. The position statement was written through a consensus process and accepted by the ACBSP Board of Directors in May of 2015. Results The ACBSP Position Statement on Pre-participation Examinations identifies the qualifications and best practices for doctors of chiropractic to perform a PPE. Conclusion This position statement states that doctors of chiropractic with post graduate education and current Diplomates of the ACBSP or Certified Chiropractic Sports Physicians certification have the prerequisite education and qualifying skills to perform PPEs.

"Objective The purpose of this case study is to describe the evaluation and management of patellar dislocations and the different approaches used from providers in different countries. Clinical Features An individual dislocated her left patella while traveling abroad and received subsequent care in Thailand, China, and the United States. Intervention and Outcome Nonoperative treatment protocols including manual closed reduction of the patella, casting of the leg, and rehabilitation exercises were employed. Conclusion Receipt of care when abroad can be challenging. The patient’s knee range of motion and pain continued to improve when she was diligent about performing the home exercise program. This case highlights the importance of a thorough examination, a proper regimen of care, and patient counseling to ensure a full recovery and minimize the chance of re-injury. "
"Objective This study assessed the short-term stability of resting pulse rate (RPR) over an approximate 10-minute period in college students. Methods Thirty-one students were recruited as a convenience sample. The RPRs were manually measured in the seated position after 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 minutes of seated rest. The RPRs were compared by rest time in repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results Mean RPR increased by 1.9 beats per minute (BPM) from 1 minute of pretest rest to the 3-minute measurement (P < .05) and by 1.5 BPM from 3 minutes to 5 minutes (P > .05). Among the 5-, 7-, and 9-minute pretest rested readings, a difference of less than or equal to 0.6 BPM was observed. Statistically significant differences were observed for (a) all comparisons involving the 1-minute rested measurement and (b) the 3- and 7-minute rested measurement. Overall, RPRs began to stabilize beginning with the 5-minute rested measurement. P P a b P P a b Conclusion In this sample of participants, RPR measurements could stabilize after a minimum of 5 minutes of pretest rest. "
"Objective The objective was to describe chiropractic and acupuncture care of a patient with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) symptoms. Clinical Features A 31-year-old woman had acute neck pain, headache, dizziness, nausea, tinnitus, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue following a fall. She was diagnosed at an urgent care facility with mTBI immediately following the fall. Pharmaceutical intervention had been ineffective for her symptoms. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated with chiropractic adjustments characterized as high velocity, low amplitude thrusts directed to the cervical spine and local acupuncture points in the cervical and cranial regions. The patient received care for a total of 8 visits over 2.5 weeks with resolution of concussive symptoms. Conclusion This patient with mTBI responded favorably to a conservative treatment protocol with the combination of chiropractic and acupuncture care. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the chiropractic management of a patient with atypical migraine headache. Clinical Features A 23-year-old woman experienced migraines for 3 months. She had no previous history of migraines and was unresponsive to pharmaceutical and musculoskeletal therapies. The migraine headaches could not be classified according to the common categories associated with migraines. She had a change in diet due to severe gastroesophageal reflux causing her to reduce or avoid consuming foods. She also had a history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Intervention and Outcome Dietary and lifestyle changes were recommended in conjunction with the administration of a multivitamin, magnesium oxide, and Ulmus rubra. Her migraine headaches improved with the resolution of her gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Ulmus rubra Ulmus rubra Conclusion This patient with atypical migraines and a history of poor dietary and lifestyle choices improved using nutritional changes and supplementing with a multivitamin and magnesium oxide.

"Objective The purpose of this study is to review the literature for possible methods in diagnosing, classifying, and monitoring deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly. Methods A search was conducted on articles through February 2014 in PubMed (Medline) and Google Scholar. Articles were included if they met the following criteria: (1) they were written in English or German; (2) they involved humans; (3) they were published in the last 10 years; (4) they had a primary research question about all possible methods for diagnosing, classifying, and monitoring deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly; and (5) an abstract was available. Results The search resulted in 58 articles. After the review, the number was reduced to 16. Of the 16 articles included, 9 were reliability studies on measurements of deformational plagiocephaly. Six measurement tools for diagnosing, classifying, and monitoring deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly were found: visual assessment, anthropometric measurements with a caliper, measurements with a flexicurve, plagiocephalometry, 3-dimensional photography, and radiological imaging. Conclusion This study found that visual assessment, flexicurve, anthropometric measurements with a caliper, and plagiocephalometry are useful measurements. At present, the plagiocephalometry and the anthropometric measurements with a caliper are more reliable methods than the visual assessment and the measurement with a flexicurve. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to describe the knowledge base and clinical practices regarding concussion by sports-certified doctors of chiropractic. Methods A 21-item survey was distributed to the 312 attendees of the 2014 American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians Sports Sciences Symposium. Results were measured by frequency analysis and descriptive statistics for all surveys completed by sports-certified chiropractors. Results Seventy-six surveys were returned by sports-certified doctors of chiropractic. All (N = 76) 100% of respondents believe that the evaluation of concussion should be performed by a health care provider with training in concussion. The respondents actively assess and manage concussion in adults (96%), adolescents (95%), and children (75%). A majority (79%) of respondents believe that the Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool–3 represents a current standard of care for the sideline evaluation of the athlete who possibly has sustained a sport concussion. Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that manual therapies may be appropriate in certain circumstances in adults (80%) and minors (80%). Conclusion This cross section of certified sports chiropractors strongly believes that the evaluation of concussion should be performed by a health care provider with specific training in concussion. A high percentage of the sports-certified chiropractors who responded assess and manage sport concussion in their practice, and many of them endorse the use of the Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool–3 as a sideline assessment tool.

"Objective The purpose of this retrospective case series is to describe treatment outcomes for patients with plantar digital neuralgia (PDN) (Morton’s neuroma) who were treated using foot manipulation. Methods Charts were reviewed retrospectively for patients with a diagnosis of PDN and who received a minimum of 6 treatments consisting of manipulation alone. Visual analogue pain scales (VAS) and pressure threshold meter readings (PTM) were extracted as outcome measures. Results Thirty-eight cases met inclusion criteria. Mean pretreatment duration of pain was 28 months. Mean pretreatment VAS was 69.5/100 mm. Mean pretreatment PTM was 2.54 Kp. By the sixth treatment, 30 (79%) of the 38 patients scored a VAS of 0 mm and a further 4 (10%) were below 10 mm. Contralateral limb PTM showed a mean pre-treatment score of 5.5 Kp, which rose slightly to 5.85 Kp. This compared to a pre-treatment score of 2.54 Kp rising to 5.86 Kp in the affected limb. This represents a 126% increase in the affected side compared to 6.5% in the unaffected limb. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant linear trend between decreasing VAS and manipulation (P < .001). P P Conclusion The patients with PDN who were included in this case series improved with conservative care that included only foot manipulation. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of Kienbock disease (lunatomalacia) that was identified through diagnostic ultrasonography. Clinical Features A 27-year-old man presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic with a 3-year history of wrist pain. The history of chief concern consisted of lunatomalacia, diagnosed 2 years prior, with surgical intervention consisting of radial osteotomy and vascularized bone graft. Radiography and ultrasonography were performed upon presentation and at 2-year follow-up that demonstrated progressive collapse and fragmentation of his lunate with the development of progressive scapholunate advanced collapse of the wrist. Intervention and Outcome Conservative care included class IV cold laser and a splint worn during strenuous activity and while sleeping. The patient received minimal pain relief and continued to experience chronic left wrist pain. He is continuing conservative care and evaluating options for further surgical intervention. Conclusion This case demonstrates a patient with chronic wrist pain and progressive collapse of the lunate demonstrated on multiple imaging modalities after surgical intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating Kienbock disease using diagnostic ultrasonography. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to describe and discuss laboratory tests ordered on elite athletes in an interdisciplinary sports medicine clinic by a doctor of chiropractic over 1 calendar year. Methods A retrospective review of laboratory tests ordered during routine clinical practice as standard screening and diagnostic tests from November 1, 2009, to November 1, 2010 was performed. Data were collected during clinical encounters at one sports medicine clinic and entered into a database for analysis. Descriptive and frequency statistics were used to describe the tests ordered and the frequency of abnormal findings. Results Five hundred and thirty-nine studies were ordered for diagnostic and routine screenings on 137 athlete patients (86 males, 51 females), representing 49 types of tests. Sample sources included blood, urine, skin lesions, and fecal matter. The most commonly ordered tests were complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum ferritin, creatine kinase, serum iron and total iron binding capacity, total cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, and lipid panels. There were 217 studies (40%) flagged as abnormal by the reporting laboratory. Conclusion This report provides greater insight into the diverse array of laboratory studies ordered over a 1-year period for diagnosis and screening of elite athletes. A high percentage of the results were flagged as abnormal by the laboratory. These findings show that the unique physiology of the elite athlete must be considered when interpreting laboratory findings in this population. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient who presented with acute musculoskeletal symptoms but was later diagnosed with multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Clinical Features An 18-year-old female presented to a chiropractic clinic with left lumbosacral pain with referral into the posterior left thigh. A provisional diagnosis was made of acute myofascial syndrome of the left piriformis and gluteus medius muscles. The patient received 3 chiropractic treatments over 1 week resulting in 80% improvement in pain intensity. Two days later, a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain caused the patient to seek urgent medical attention. A diagnostic ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis were performed and interpreted as normal. Following this, the patient reported increased pain in her left leg. Evaluation revealed edema of the left calf and decreased left lower limb sensation. A venous Doppler ultrasound was ordered. Intervention and Outcomes Doppler ultrasound revealed reduction of the venous flow in the femoral vein area. An additional ultrasonography evaluation revealed an extensive DVTs affecting the left femoral vein and iliac axis extending towards the vena cava. Upon follow-up with a hematologist, the potential diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome was considered based on the absence of blood dyscrasias and sustained anatomical changes found in the left common iliac vein at its junction with the right common iliac artery. A week following discharge, she presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy and insertion of a vena cava filter. Conclusion Although DVTs are common in the general population, presence in low-risk individuals may be overlooked. In the presence of subtle initial clinical signs such as those described in this case report, clinicians should keep a high index of suspicion for a DVT. Rapid identification of such clinical signs in association with a lack of objective examination findings warrants further evaluation due to potentially negative outcomes. "
"Background Nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is a common reason for accessing primary care. Manual therapy (MT) may be an effective treatment, but data from clinical studies including relevant subgroups and clinical settings are sparse. The objective of this article is to describe the protocol of a study that will measure whether an MT protocol provided by general medical practitioners will lead to a faster pain reduction in patients with nonspecific LBP than does standard medical care. Methods/Design The study is an experimental pre-/postintervention design. The intervention consists of add-on MT treatment by general medical practitioners who have received MT training but are otherwise inexperienced in mobilization techniques. Participating general medical practitioners (n = 10) will consecutively recruit and treat patients before and after their training, serving as their own internal controls. The primary end point is a combined outcome assessing change in pain score over days 0 to 3 and time until pain is reduced by 2 points on an 11-point numeric pain scale and painkiller use is stopped. Secondary outcomes are patients’ functional capacities assessed using a questionnaire, amount of sick leave taken, patient satisfaction, and referrals for further treatment. Trial registration German clinical trials register: DRKS-ID DRKS00003240. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management of an elderly man with untreated bilateral hip joint dysplasia presenting with mild acute mechanical low back pain. Clinical Features A 75-year-old man presented with an insidious-onset intermittent low back pain of 3 days’ duration. Physical examination findings supported a mechanical cause for mild acute low back pain. Plain radiography revealed dysplasia of hip joints with absence of femoral heads and necks and bilateral high dislocation. Intervention and Outcome Chiropractic management included vibration, mobilization, light drop-piece adjustments of the lower lumbar and sacroiliac joints, and recommendation of the use of heat at home. Treatments were given 3 times over the course of 1 week. The low back pain intensity over this period dropped from 5 to 0 on an 11-point numerical rating scale, and the patient was discharged. Conclusion This patient with substantial postural and gait abnormalities as a result of severe bilateral hip dysplasia associated with an unusual pattern of osteoarthritic change in the spine responded favorably to a short course of chiropractic care.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to describe non-Hispanic blacks that use chiropractic health care to better understand this underserved demographic. Methods E-mail and telephone calls were used to recruit doctors of chiropractic (DCs) in Texas and Louisiana to distribute anonymous surveys to their non-Hispanic black patients. Twenty doctors volunteered to participate. Each was sent 10 surveys and self-addressed envelopes to distribute. All doctors were given at least 3 months to distribute surveys to as many non-Hispanic black patients that they had. The survey contained 20 questions designed to develop a profile of non-Hispanic black patients that used chiropractic care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and other patient attributes. Results Two-hundred surveys were distributed and 44 were completed, yielding a response rate of 22%. Non-Hispanic black patients were more likely to be female (54.5%), be older than 50 years (56.8%), be a college graduate (59.1%), be employed (61.9%), report not receiving public assistance in the past 5 years (81.4%), report a household income of $20 000 to $60 000 a year (48.8%), and born in the United States (83.7%). Participants reported that there was a DC within 30 minutes of their address (81.4%), their DC always explained things to them in an easy-to-understand manner (81.8%), their DC always showed respect for what they had to say (88.6%), and their DC always cared about them as a person (86.4%). Conclusions In the sample surveyed, non-Hispanic black patients tended to be female, be older, be college educated, be employed, and have a positive viewpoint on their interactions with their DC. "
"Objective The purpose of this pilot study was to test methods needed to conduct a study with adequate power to investigate consistency between the arm-fossa test (AFT) and the Gillet test. Methods A convenience sample of chiropractic college students enrolled in a weekend Sacro-Occipital Technique seminar participated. Each was tested with AFT and sacroiliac orthopedic tests, including the Gillet test. Statistical testing included calculation of κ for consistency of the AFT and Gillet test and their diagnostic efficiency. κ κ Results This study recruited 14 participants. Important issues arose in gathering and recording data, the standardization of examiner methods, and the flow of participants to examination stations. κ for AFT and Gillet test consistency = 0.55, corresponding to “moderate.” κ κ Conclusion This pilot suggests that the future study should include a mix of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants; record trichotomous data, where appropriate; use washout periods between diagnostic tests; and refine the selection of orthopedic tests deployed besides the AFT. The preliminary data are consistent with but do not establish due to the very small sample size and experimental design issues, that a positive AFT may be consistent with a negative Gillet test. "
"Objective The aims of this study were to examine autonomic nervous system responses by using heart rate variability analysis (HRV), hemodynamic parameters and numeric pain scale (NPS) when either upper (C1 and C2) or lower (C6 and C7) cervical segments were manipulated in volunteers, and whether such response would be altered in acute mechanical neck pain patients after spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). Methods A randomized controlled, cross-over, preliminary study was conducted on 10 asymptomatic normotensive volunteers and 10 normotensive patients complaining of acute neck pain. HRV, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), and NPS were recorded after upper cervical and lower cervical segments SMT in volunteer and patient groups. Results The standard deviation of average normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN) increased (83.54 ± 22 vs. 105.41 ± 20; P = .02) after upper cervical SMT. The normalized unit of high frequency (nuHF), which shows parasympathetic activity, was predominant (40.18 ± 9 vs. 46.08 ± 14) after upper cervical SMT (P = .03) with a significant decrease (109 ± 10 vs. 98 ± 5) in systolic BP (P = .002). Low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, which shows predominance of sympathetic activity increased (1.05 ± 0.7 vs. 1.51 ± 0.5; P = .02) after lower cervical SMT in the healthy volunteers group. However, there was an increase in SDNN (70.48 ± 18 vs. 90.23 ± 20; P = .02 and 75.19 ± 16 vs 97.52 ± 22; P = .01), a decrease in LF/HF ratio (1.33 ± 0.3 vs. 0.81 ± 0.2; P = .001 and 1.22 ± 0.4 vs. 0.86 ± 0.3; P = .02), which was associated with decreased systolic BP (105 ± 10 vs. 95 ± 9; P = .01 and 102 ± 9 vs. 91 ± 10; P = .02) and NPS scores (3 ± 1 vs. 0; P = .01 and 3 ± 1 vs. 1 ± 1; P = .03) following both upper and lower cervical SMT in the patient’s group. The baseline HR was 67 ± 9 vs 64 ± 5 (upper cervical) and 65 ± 7 vs 69 ± 11 (lower cervical) in both the healthy volunteer’ and patient’ groups. P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P Conclusion Upper cervical SMT enhances dominance of parasympathetic and lower cervical SMT enhances dominance of sympathetic activity in this young volunteer group. However, dominance of parasympathetic activity was found in patients with neck pain that received both upper and lower cervical SMT. "
"Objective The purpose of this preliminary study was to compare the application of the light emitting diode (LED) to sham LED in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods Eighteen subjects met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned into 2 groups: light emitting diode or sham LED. The subjects received either the LED at 12 J/cm2 or sham LED along 2 points of the plantar fascia. Subjects in both groups received a 10 minute transverse friction massage and participated in 4 plantar fascia stretching exercises. All subjects received a total of 6 treatments over 3 weeks. Progress was assessed using the lower extremity functional and analog pain scale. 2 2 Results No significant difference was found between treatment groups (P = .845). There was a significant difference in pain and outcome scores over time within both groups (P < .35). P P P P Conclusion Among patients with plantar fasciitis, the use of LED did not result in greater improvement in function or pain compared with sham treatment. The findings suggest that manual intervention and passive stretching activities may have provided significant pain relief and improvement in functional outcome scores. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate attitudes towards Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) for extremity problems and inter-examiner reliability of classifying extremity problems into MDT subgroups by credentialed practitioners in MDT (Cred.MDT) in Japan. Methods A cross-sectional survey was used and all 120 Cred.MDT practitioners registered in the McKenzie Institute International Japan branch were asked about their attitude towards MDT for extremity problems and were asked to select the most appropriate MDT subgroup for each of the 25 extremity patient vignettes. Model classifications were used to investigate accuracy of classification. Percent agreement and Kappa analyses were examined. Results Sixty practitioners (50%) participated in this study. For the management of patients with extremity problems, the majority did not use MDT most of the time (53%) due to a lack of confidence in using MDT in the extremities (78%). The overall accuracy for their MDT classification for extremity problems was 87% (Fleiss's κ = 0.78). Conclusions The majority of the Cred.MDT practitioners in Japan did not use MDT frequently and were not confident to use MDT with extremity patients. However, accuracy and inter-examiner agreement of their MDT classification from the information on the assessment sheet was good. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate “earthing” from an electrical perspective through measurement and analysis of the naturally occurring electron flow between the human body or a control and ground as this relates to the magnitude of the charge exchange, the relationship between the charge exchange and body functions (respiration and heart rate), and the detection of other information that might be contained in the charge exchange. Methods Sensitive, low-noise instrumentation was designed and fabricated to measure low-level current flow at low frequencies. This instrumentation was used to record current flow between human subjects or a control and ground, and these measurements were performed approximately 40 times under varied circumstances. The results of these measurements were analyzed to determine if information was contained in the current exchange. Results The currents flowing between the human body and ground were small (nanoamperes), and they correlated with subject motion. There did not appear to be any information contained in this exchange except for information about subject motion. Conclusions This study showed that currents flow between the environment (earth) and a grounded human body; however, these currents are small (nanoamperes) and do not appear to contain information other than information about subject motion. "
"Objective The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the amount of error in retrolisthesis measurement due to measurement methods or projection factors inherent in spinal radiography. In addition, this study compared how accurately these methods determine positions of the lumbar vertebrae being studied and the expected projected size of the retrolisthesis. Methods Vertebral models were situated in a retrolisthesis position. Radiographs of the models were obtained in positive and negative y-axis rotations at 40- and 84-in focal film distances. The projected retrolisthesis was measured using the Gohl, Iguchi, and Lopes methods. Results At the 40-in focal film distance, the Iguchi method and Lopes methods were significantly more accurate than the Gohl method. At the 84-in focal film distance, the Lopes method was significantly more accurate than the Gohl method. Almost all measurements overestimated both the actual amount of retrolisthesis as well as the amount of trigonometrically calculated retrolisthesis that should have been present on the radiographs. Findings suggest that measurements were less accurate with vertebrae rotated more than 10°. Conclusions This study demonstrated that lumbar vertebral rotation, focal film distance, and measurement methods are potential sources of error in retrolisthesis measurement. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of midlumbar spinal manipulation on asymptomatic cyclist sprint performance and hip flexibility. Methods Twelve cyclists were equally randomized into an AB:BA crossover study design after baseline testing. Six participants were in the AB group, and 6 were in the BA group. The study involved 1 week of rest in between each of the 3 tested conditions: baseline testing (no intervention prior to testing), condition A (bilateral midlumbar spine manipulation prior to testing), and condition B (sham acupuncture prior to testing, as a control). Testing was blinded and involved a sit-and-reach test followed by a 0.5-km cycle ergometer sprint test against 4-kp resistance. Outcome measures were sit-and-reach distance, time to complete 0.5 km, maximum heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion. An additional 8 cyclists were recruited and used as a second set of controls that engaged in 3 testing sessions without any intervention to track test acclimation. An analysis of variance was used to compare dependent variables under each of the 3 conditions for the experimental group and control group #1, and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze test acclimation in control group #2. Results Lumbar spine manipulation did not demonstrate statistically significant between-group changes in sit-and-reach (P = .765), 0.5-km sprint performance time (P = .877), maximum exercise heart rate (P = .944), or rating of perceived exertion (P = .875). P P P P P P P P Conclusions The findings of this preliminary study showed that midlumbar spinal manipulation did not improve hip flexibility or cyclist power output of asymptomatic participants compared with an acupuncture sham and no-treatment control groups.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine if elastic therapeutic tape placed on anterior lower limbs would affect stride and step length in fatigued runners’ gait. Methods Forty-two healthy participants were equally divided into a kinesiology tape group (Rocktape) and a no-tape control group. Participants in both groups underwent a baseline running gait test at 6 mph without tape. After this, participants engaged in an exhaustive lower body fatigue protocol until they reached maximal volitional exhaustion. Participants were then randomized to 1 of 2 interventions: (1) Experimental group, which had kinesiology tape placed under tension on the anterior aspect of their lower limbs bilaterally from the upper thigh to just below the patella, or (2) Control group, which did not receive taping. All participants then engaged in a similar 6-mph running gait postanalysis. Participant’s gait was analyzed for 90 seconds during each test iteration. Researchers used a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance considering fatigue (prefatigue, postfatigue) and group (tape, no-tape) as subject factors. Results After the fatigue protocol, the no-tape group demonstrated a significant decrease in step length of 14.2 mm (P = .041) and stride length of 29.4 mm (P = .043). The kinesiology tape group did not demonstrate a significant decline in these gait parameters. P P P P Conclusions In this preliminary study, placing elastic therapeutic tape over the anterior lower limbs demonstrated short-term preservation of runner step length and stride length in a fatigued state.

"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the chiropractic management of a patient with idiopathic, intermittent right-sided hemiparesthesia. Clinical Features A 24-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of intermittent idiopathic right arm paresthesia. She also had a 3-month history of intermittent idiopathic right leg/face paresthesia. These symptoms were strongest at night and caused insomnia and worsened over time. She rated her discomfort at 5/10 on a numeric scale. Intervention and Outcome Care included vibration stimulation therapy, spinal manipulation and cold laser therapy. She had a noticeable reduction in her paresthesia both subjectively and objectively. She showed improvement in paresthesia on the right side of her body after the first visit. The following week, after 2 visits she returned and stated that she was symptom free with 0/10 discomfort on a numeric scale. Conclusion This patient's symptoms of idiopathic, intermittent right-sided hemi-paresthesia seemed to improve with a short course of chiropractic care using manipulation, vibration therapy and cold laser therapy. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient with bilateral idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), provide a discussion of differential diagnosis for anterior hip pain, imaging, and treatment recommendations for ONFH. Clinical features A 34-year-old man was initially treated by a chiropractic physician for low back pain. At the end of a three week trial of care, the patient’s low back pain resolved. However, he reported a new complaint of mild left anterior hip stiffness. After re-examination, a homecare exercise program was prescribed. The patient returned 1 month later with substantial left anterior hip pain and walked with a noticeable limp. Radiography of the left hip demonstrated advanced ONFH. Magnetic resonance imaging of both hips demonstrated the extent of involvement of the left hip while incidentally revealing ONFH on the right. Intervention and Outcome A total hip arthroplasty was performed on the left hip and the right hip is being monitored without intervention. Conclusion Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a challenging clinical problem with non-specific and wide-ranging signs and symptoms requiring clinicians to engage a cautious and comprehensive differential diagnosis. Prompt recognition ensures that appropriate treatment can be initiated in a timely manner and optimal patient outcomes achieved. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of a 1-year multimodal program with the addition of 2 different traction approaches on the pain, function, disability, and nerve root function in patients with discogenic cervical radiculopathy (CR). This study also attempted to identify the optimal traction angle based on the maximum recovery of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex. Methods This randomized clinical trial with one-year follow-up included a total of 216 (101 female) patients with unilateral lower discogenic CR were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The standard care group (C) received the multimodal program (pain relief methods, muscle strengthening, and thoracic spine manipulation). The ventroflexion traction group (A) received the same multimodal program as group C, with added traditional ventroflexion traction. The novel traction group (B) received the same multimodal program as group C in addition to a flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex-based traction method. Primary outcomes were the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and secondary outcomes included neck pain, arm pain, and the amplitude and latency of the H-reflex. Patients were assessed at 3 intervals (pre-treatment, 4 weeks post-treatment, and the 1-year follow-up). Results The mixed linear model with repeated measures indicated a significant group × time effect in favor of the novel cervical traction group (B) for measures of NDI (F = 412.6, P < .0005), neck pain (F = 108.9, P < .0005), arm pain (F = 91.3, P < .0005), H- reflex amplitude (F = 207.7, P < .0005), and H-reflex latency (F = 58.9 P < .0005). We found that the extension position of cervical spine (5° extension) was the position that achieved the maximum improvement in the novel cervical traction method. P P P P P P P P P P Conclusions This preliminary study showed that a multimodal program with a novel cervical traction method added improved NDI, neck pain, arm pain, and the amplitude and latency of FCR H-reflex for a group of patients with chronic discogenic CR.

"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of mobilization and eccentric exercise training for a patient with ankle pain and a history of chronic ankle sprains and discuss the course of diagnostic decision making when the patient did not respond to care. Clinical Features A 48-year-old police officer who had sustained multiple ankle sprains throughout his life presented with pain and restriction in his ability to walk, run, and work. The Global Rating of Change Scale score was − 6, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score was 7/10, and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale score was − 33. Palpation of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles and inversion with overpressure reproduced the chief concern (Numeric Pain Rating Scale 7/10). The patient was initially diagnosed with chronic peroneal tendinopathy. Intervention and Outcome Treatment included lateral translation mobilization of the talocrural joint combined with eccentric exercise using an elastic band for the peroneal muscles. The patient reported improvement in pain and function during the course of intervention but not as rapidly as expected. Therefore, follow-up ultrasonographic imaging and radiography were performed. These studies revealed partial rupture of the peroneal brevis muscle and total rupture of the peroneal longus muscle. Conclusion A patient with long-term concerns of the foot complex with a diagnosis of peroneal tendinopathy showed slight improvement with eccentric exercises combined with manual therapy of the talocrural joint. After a course of treatment but minimal response, a diagnosis of tendon rupture was confirmed with diagnostic ultrasonography. Clinicians should be aware that when injuries do not improve with care, tendon rupture should be considered. "
"Objective This article presents an overview of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is a collection of risk factors that can lead to diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. The purposes of this article are to describe the current literature on the etiology and pathophysiology of insulin resistance as it relates to MetS and to suggest strategies for dietary and supplemental management in chiropractic practice. Methods The literature was searched in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Web site of the American Heart Association, from the earliest date possible to May 2014. Review articles were identified that outlined pathophysiology of MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and relationships among diet, supplements, and glycemic regulation, MetS, T2DM, and musculoskeletal pain. Results Metabolic syndrome has been linked to increased risk of developing T2DM and cardiovascular disease and increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Insulin resistance is linked to musculoskeletal complaints both through chronic inflammation and the effects of advanced glycosylation end products. Although diabetes and cardiovascular disease are the most well-known diseases that can result from MetS, an emerging body of evidence demonstrates that common musculoskeletal pain syndromes can be caused by MetS. Conclusions This article provides an overview of lifestyle management of MetS that can be undertaken by doctors of chiropractic by means of dietary modification and nutritional support to promote blood sugar regulation.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to test the utility of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) as a resource for collecting data on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) within academic health centers at a chiropractic college; and, to describe changes in PRO following pragmatic chiropractic care incorporating instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) on pain symptoms. Methods This was a pre-post intervention design without a control group (case series) involving 25 patients (14 females and 11 males; 40.5 ± 16.39 years, range 20-70 years) who completed their chiropractic care and their baseline and post-treatment pain assessments. The pragmatic chiropractic care intervention included both spinal manipulation and IASTM to treat pain symptoms. PRO’s were collected using PROMIS to measure pain behavior, pain interference and pain intensity. Results The average pre-post assessment interval was 33 ± 22.5 days (95% CI, 23-42 days). The durations of treatments ranged from one week to 10 weeks. The median number of IASTM treatments was six. Pre-post decreases in T-scores for pain behavior and pain interference were 55.5 to 48.4 and 57.7 to 48.4, respectively (P < .05). Only 12 patients had a baseline T-score for pain intensity greater than 50. The pre-post decrease in pain intensity T-scores for these 12 patients was from 53.4 to 40.9. P P Conclusion Within the limitations of a case series design, these data provide initial evidence on the utility of PROMIS instruments for clinical and research outcomes in chiropractic patients. "
"Objective The purposes of this study were to estimate the 1-month point prevalence of bowel and bladder symptoms (BBS) among adult chiropractic patients and to evaluate associations between these symptoms and low back pain (LBP). Methods Patients 18 years or older presenting to a chiropractic college academic health clinic between March 25 and April 25, 2013, were asked to complete a symptom screening questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression, Fisher exact test, and P values were calculated from the sample. P P Results The sample included 140 of 1300 patients who visited the clinic during the survey period (11%). Mean age was 47.5 (range 18-79) years. LBP was the primary chief complaint in 42%. The 1-month point prevalence of any bladder symptoms was 75%, while the rate for bowel symptoms was 62%; 55% reported both BBS. Binary logistic regression analyses showed no statistically significant association between a chief complaint of LBP and combined BBS (OR = 1.67, P = .164). P P Conclusion The prevalence of bowel and bladder symptoms in chiropractic patients was high. There was no statistically significant association between these symptoms and LBP in this group of patients seeking care for LBP. "
"Objective The purpose of this paper is to present a case of a patient with neck pain, tinnitus, and headache in the setting of bilateral elongated styloid processes (ESP) and calcified stylohyoid ligaments (CSL), how knowledge of this anatomical variation and symptomatic presentation affected the rehabilitation management plan for this patient, and to discuss the potential relevance of ESPs and CSLs to carotid artery dissection. Clinical features A 29-year-old male military helicopter mechanic presented for chiropractic care for chronic pain in the right side of his neck and upper back, tinnitus, and dizziness with a past history of right side parietal headaches and tonsillitis. Conventional radiographs showed C6 and C7 spinous process fractures, degenerative disc disease at C6/7, and an elongated right styloid process with associated calcification of the left stylohyoid ligament. Volumetric computerized tomography demonstrated calcification of the stylohyoid ligaments bilaterally. Intervention and outcome Given the proximity of the calcified stylohyoid apparatus to the carotid arteries, spinal manipulation techniques were modified to minimize rotation of the neck. Rehabilitation also included soft tissue mobilization and stretching, corrective postural exercises, and acupuncture. An otolaryngologist felt that the symptoms were not consistent with Eagle syndrome and the tinnitus was associated with symmetric high frequency hearing loss, likely due to occupational noise exposure. Initially, the patient's symptoms improved but plateaued by the fifth visit. Conclusion Neck pain in the presence of ESPs and CSLs can be associated with Eagle syndrome, which can include ipsilateral head and neck pain, odynophagia, dysphagia, and cerebrovascular symptoms. This case, initially thought to be Eagle syndrome, highlights proper diagnostic workup for this condition and presents potential contraindications to consider with regard to cervical spine manipulation in such patients. Manual therapy precautions pertaining to cervical spine manipulation may be appropriate in cases involving ESPs and calcified stylohyoid ligaments. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the presentation of a patient with lumbosacral chordoma characterized by somatic chronic low back pain and intermittent sacral nerve impingement. Case report A 69-year-old male presenting to an emergency department (ED) with low back pain was provided analgesics and muscle relaxants then referred for a series of chiropractic treatments. Chiropractic treatment included manipulation, physical therapy, and rehabilitation. After 3 times per week for a total of 4 weeks, re-examination showed little relief of his symptoms. His pain symptoms worsened and he presented to the ED for the second time. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed and revealed a high intensity mass. Intervention and outcome The soft tissue mass identified on magnetic resonance imaging was surgically removed. Shortly after the surgery, the patient developed post-operative bleeding and was returned to surgery. During the second procedure, he developed a post-operative hemorrhage related to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subsequently died during the second procedure. A malignant lumbosacral chordoma was diagnosed on pathologic examination. Conclusion This case report describes the presentation of a patient with lumbosacral chordoma presenting with musculoskeletal low back pain. Chordomas are rare with few prominent manifestations. An early diagnosis can potentially make a difference in morbidity and mortality. Due to its insidious nature, it is a difficult diagnosis and one that is often delayed. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe a patient who presented to a chiropractic physician for evaluation and treatment of neck pain and headache. Clinical features A 45-year-old otherwise healthy female presented for evaluation and treatment of neck pain and headache. Within minutes, non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms progressed to neurological deficits, including limb ataxia and cognitive disturbances. Suspicion was raised for cerebrovascular ischemia and emergent referral was initiated. Intervention and outcome Paramedics were immediately summoned and the patient was transported to a local hospital with a working diagnosis of acute cerebrovascular ischemia. Multiplanar computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging with contrast revealed vertebral artery dissection of the V2 segment in the right vertebral artery. Anticoagulation therapy was administered and the patient was discharged without complications after 5 days in the hospital. 2 2 Conclusion This case highlights the potential for patients with vertebral artery dissection to present with nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints. Neurological symptoms may not manifest initially, but their sudden onset indicates the possibility of an ischemic cerebrovascular event. We suggest that early recognition and emergent referral for this patient avoided potential exacerbation of an evolving pre-existing condition and resulted in timely anticoagulation treatment. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the chiropractic management of a patient with Parkinson disease. Clinical features An 81-year-old male with a 12-year history of Parkinson disease sought chiropractic care. He had a stooped posture and a shuffling gait. He was not able to ambulate comfortably without the guidance of his walker. The patient had a resting tremor, most notably in his right hand. Outcome measures were documented using the Parkinson’s Disease Questionaire-39 (PDQ-39) and patient subjective reports. Intervention and outcome The patient was treated with blue-lensed glasses, vibration stimulation therapy, spinal manipulation, and eye-movement exercises. Within the first week of treatment, there was a reduction in symptoms, improvement in ambulation, and tremor. Conclusion For this particular patient, the use of alternative treatment procedures appeared to help his Parkinson disease signs and symptoms. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management of a patient with overactive bladder (OAB) and to describe an hypothetical anatomical basis for a somato-vesical reflex and possible clinical link between pelvic and symphysis pubis dysfunction to OAB. Clinical features A 24-year-old nulliparous female with idiopathic OAB, with a primary complaint of nocturia presented for chiropractic care. Her sleep was limited to 2 consecutive hours due to bladder urgency. Pubic symphysis shear dysfunction was observed on physical examination. Intervention and outcomes The primary treatment modality used was chiropractic side-posture drop-table manipulation designed to reduce pubic shear dysfunction. After 8 treatments in 1 month, the pubic shear gradually reduced while nocturia diminished and consecutive sleep hours increased from 2 to 7. At 1-year follow-up, the nocturia remained resolved. Conclusion The patient reported in this case responded favorably to chiropractic care, which resulted in reduced nocturia and increased sleep continuity. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe combined treatment utilizing Cox distraction manipulation and guided rehabilitation for a patient with spine pain and post-surgical C6-7 fusion with spondylotic myelopathy and L5-S1 radiculopathy. Clinical features A 38-year-old man presented to a chiropractic clinic with neck pain and a history of an anterior cervical spine plate fusion at C6-7 after a work related accident 4 years earlier. He had signs and symptoms of spondolytic myelopathy and right lower back, right posterior thigh pain and numbness. Intervention and outcome The patient was treated with Cox technique and rehabilitation. The patient experienced a reduction of pain on a numeric pain scale from 8/10 to 3/10. The patient was seen a total of 12 visits over 3 months. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions A patient with a prior C6-7 fusion with spondylotic myelopathy and concurrent L5-S1 radiculopathy improved after a course of rehabilitation and Cox distraction manipulation. Further research is needed to establish its efficiency. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the opinions of experienced cyclists on perceived influence of a posture-cueing shirt with compressive properties on their comfort and recovery. Methods Twenty experienced cyclists wore a compressive shirt during rides and as a postride recovery shirt; cyclists rated their perceived experiences during rides and recovery. They completed 2 separate questionnaires specific to riding or recovery; scores ranged from − 3.0 (negative influence) to + 3.0 (positive influence), addressing posture, discomfort, breathing, and recovery. Data analysis included frequencies and t tests to compare groups. t t Results Cyclists completed 53 rides, averaging 95.48 km (SD = 31.72 km), wearing the shirt and reported a perceived benefit (mean score = 1.17, SD = 0.25). For their postride recovery perceptions, scores averaged 1.99 (SD = 0.48) for perceived benefits for recovery. No differences in scores were identified between male and female cyclists during rides (t = − 0.28, P > .05); however, female riders perceived greater benefit during recovery (t = − 2.24, P < .05). There were no correlations with scores and cyclist age, experience, or ride distances during rides or recovery (r = 0.02-0.35). t P t P r t P t P r Conclusion A posture-cueing, compressive shirt was rated to have a perceived benefit by experienced cyclists for riding posture, postride posture, spine discomfort, and postride recovery. This study did not evaluate physical or physiologic variables to confirm these perceptions. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of betahistine dihydrochloride alone and in combination with vestibular rehabilitation for the management of patients with balance disorders following head trauma. Methods In this preliminary clinical trial, a group of patients with head trauma was referred to our university-based tertiary care balance unit over a 1-year period. The study included 60 patients with balance disorder following head trauma. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups with 20 patients each. The first group was treated by betahistine dihydrochloride tablets 48 mg/d alone. The second group was treated with a standard vestibular rehabilitation program. The third group was given betahistine dihydrochloride tablets (48 mg/d) in addition to the early standard vestibular rehabilitation program. Videonystagmography was used in the diagnosis, characterization, and monitoring of all patients with balance disorders, with improvement of the pretreatment objective results taken as a marker for treatment progress. Results Recovery time was within the first 3 months following head trauma in 57 (95%) of the patients. Recovery was faster after mild head trauma than after moderate and severe traumas. Patients who underwent vestibular rehabilitation immediately after the onset of head trauma (with or without addition of betahistine dihydrochloride) recovered earlier than those treated with betahistine dihydrochloride alone. Conclusion Based on these preliminary findings in a small group of patients, early vestibular rehabilitation with the concomitant use of betahistine dihydrochloride showed better results than the other 2 treatments alone in patients with balance disorders following head trauma. Early vestibular rehabilitation seemed to improve recovery that was enhanced by the use of betahistine dihydrochloride, and may have depressed the associated adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting.

"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of dry needling based on myofascial meridians for management of plantar fasciitis. Clinical features A 53-year-old man presented with bilateral chronic foot pain for more than 2 years. After 2 months of conventional treatment (ultrasound, plantar fascia and Achilles tendon stretching, and intrinsic foot strengthening), symptoms eventually improved; however, symptoms returned after prolonged standing or walking. Almost all previous treatment methods were localized in the site of pain that targeted only the plantar fascia. Initial examination of this individual revealed that multiple tender points were found along the insertion of Achilles tendon, medial gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and ischial tuberosity. Intervention and outcome Dry needling of the trigger points was applied. After 4 treatments over 2 weeks, the patient felt a 60% to 70% reduction in pain. His pressure pain threshold was increased, and pain was alleviated. The patient returned to full daily activities. The rapid relief of this patient’s pain after 2 weeks of dry needling to additional locations along the superficial back line suggests that a more global view on management was beneficial to this patient. Conclusion Dry needling based on myofascial meridians improved the symptoms for a patient with recurrent plantar fasciitis. "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe a case of an aneurysmal bone cyst presenting as a pathologic fracture in a young athlete. Case report A 12-year-old patient presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic with a 1-week history of posterior neck pain and stiffness following a helmet-to-helmet collision in football practice. Cervical spine radiographs were taken. Lateral view radiograph demonstrated a pathologic fracture through a lytic, expansive lesion in the posterior arch of C7 with mild subluxation of the C7/T1 apophyseal joints and angulation of the C7/T1 disk space. Based upon these findings, additional diagnostic imaging was ordered. Findings on advanced imaging studies included the following: On computed tomography, the C7 lesion showed medullary destruction, cortical thinning and expansion, and a horizontally oriented fracture through the spinous and lamina. Magnetic resonance imaging studies for sagittal T2 and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance images revealed fluid/fluid levels in the C7 spinous and peripheral enhancement with contrast. Outcome The patient was referred to a local hospital for treatment. The lesion was treated with resection of the posterior arch, and an aneurysmal bone cyst was confirmed histologically. The patient developed a kyphotic deformity at the site of resection and cervical instability. A subsequent fusion was performed. Conclusion Aneurysmal bone cysts are rare lesions. In this case, the initial traumatic history masked the underlying pathology. Although rare, pathologic fracture should be considered in cases of vertebral fracture in young patients. "
"Objective The purpose of this case series is to report the effects of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) for patients with lumbopelvic (lumbar spine, sacroiliac and/or pelvic, hip) pain in an outpatient ambulatory/hospital-based setting. Methods A retrospective chart review of cases treated at an outpatient ambulatory surgical center in New York and a general hospital in New York was performed. Patients with pre- and postintervention Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI) scores and lumbopelvic and hip complaints were included (N = 18). No intervention other than MUA was administered between the initial and follow-up ODI scoring. Scores on the ODI were assessed within 1 week prior to MUA and again within 2 weeks postprocedure. Results Patients underwent 2 to 4 chiropractic MUA procedures over the course of 7 to 8 days as per National Academy of Manipulation Under Anesthesia physicians' protocols. Preprocedure ODI scores ranged from 38 to 76, with an average score of 53.4. Postprocedure scores ranged from 0 to 66, with an average score of 32.8. For each patient, ODI scores were lower after MUA, with an average decrease of 20.6. Sixteen of 18 patients experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in ODI score. No adverse reactions were reported. Conclusions For 16 of the 18 patients with chronic lumbopelvic pain reported in this study, MUA showed clinically meaningful reduction in low back pain disability.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of manipulative and manual therapy treatments with regard to pain perception and neck mobility in patients with tension-type headache. Methods A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 84 adults diagnosed with tension-type headache. Eighty-four subjects were enrolled in this study: 68 women and 16 men. Mean age was 39.76 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years. A total of 57.1% were diagnosed with chronic tension-type headache and 42.9% with tension-type headache. Participants were divided into 3 treatment groups (manual therapy, manipulative therapy, a combination of manual and manipulative therapy) and a control group. Four treatment sessions were administered during 4 weeks, with posttreatment assessment and follow-up at 1 month. Cervical ranges of motion pain perception, and frequency and intensity of headaches were assessed. Results All 3 treatment groups showed significant improvements in the different dimensions of pain perception. Manual therapy and manipulative treatment improved some cervical ranges of motion. Headache frequency was reduced with manipulative treatment (P < .008). Combined treatment reported improvement after the treatment (P < .000) and at follow-up (P < .002). Pain intensity improved after the treatment and at follow-up with manipulative therapy (P < .01) and combined treatment (P < .01). P P P P P P P P P P Conclusions Both treatments, administered both separately and combined together, showed efficacy for patients with tension-type headache with regard to pain perception. As for cervical ranges of motion, treatments produced greater effect when separately administered. "
"Objective Concussion is a common sporting injury that may be seen by doctors of chiropractic and should be managed following current practice guidelines. The purpose of this abstract is to present a literature review on chiropractic management of concussion in sport and to discuss current guidelines. Methods A review of the literature was performed using the PubMed search engine. MeSH terms included chiropractic and concussion. Search dates were the beginning of the record through July 30, 2013. All languages and article types were included in the search. Articles found were retrieved and evaluated for the relevance of chiropractic management of concussion in sport. chiropractic concussion chiropractic concussion Results Five articles were found (1 prospective study, 1 survey, 3 literature reviews) ranging in publication years from 1993 to 2012. No articles reported a position statement, and none provided a review of current concussion management practices related to chiropractic practice. No articles reported adverse outcomes of chiropractic management of an athlete with concussion. Conclusion Research related to the chiropractic management of concussion in sport is a nascent area of investigation. Although there are few published articles, the articles in this review showed that doctors of chiropractic encounter concussed athletes at events and in clinical practice. It is essential for doctors of chiropractic to understand the importance of using standardized concussion assessment tools and current concussion guidelines. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic care of a patient with persistent headache treated using chiropractic manipulative therapy and adjunct treatments. Clinical features A 54-year-old multiparous woman had chronic debilitating headaches for 11 months. Previous care from a variety of specialties had brought no appreciable relief. Intervention and outcome The patient was managed with chiropractic manipulative therapy, injections, and electromagnetic therapy. Five treatments over 6 weeks brought resolution of the headaches. Conclusion This patient with persistent headache responded favorably to a course of chiropractic and adjunctive care. "
"Objective The purpose of this literature review was to demonstrate, through examples in the current literature, the cumulative and long-term effects of multiple concussions, postinjury protocols, and the efficacy of current and past return-to-play guidelines. Methods A PubMed search was performed using the keywords and key phrases: concussions and long-term effects, concussions and return to play, and multiple concussions. We limited the search to articles that had been published from August 2007 to August 2012 and were specific to human participants. Of the 450 total articles that the search returned, we selected studies specifically demonstrating athletes who were symptom-free, passed neuropsychological testing, returned to play, and were tested in measures of postural control, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalographic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy. concussions and long-term effects concussions and return to play multiple concussions concussions and long-term effects concussions and return to play multiple concussions Results Selected studies show evidence that, although a previously concussed athlete may be symptom-free and returned to a neuropsychological baseline, the athlete may continue to have prolonged neurological abnormalities that could disqualify them from being ready to return to play. Conclusion It appears that some neurological deficits persist beyond the current return-to-play standards and that discrepancy exists between common practices of returning athletes to competition and new standards of published research. "
"Objective The purpose of this case series is to report how the symptom section of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2) was used to manage athletes with concussions in a high school training room setting and to address the need for SCAT2 baseline measurements. Clinical features During a 4-month period, 3 doctors of chiropractic with certification from the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians managed 15 high school athletes with concussions in a multidisciplinary setting. Fourteen athletes were male American football players, and one was a female volleyball player. Intervention and outcome Of the 15 athletes, 3 athletes had baseline SCAT2 documentation. Athletes were evaluated and returned to play with a graded return to play protocol using the SCAT2 symptoms and serial physical examinations. Once participants were asymptomatic, they began a graded return to play process. A total of 47 SCAT2 tests were performed on the 15 athletes, averaging 3.13 SCAT2 evaluations per patient. Of the 15 athletes evaluated, 6 were managed and cleared for return to play; 2 of the athletes sustained concussions in the last week of the season, thus ending their season; and 3 athletes were cleared by medical doctors. None of the athletes under care reported an adverse event. Conclusion The utilization of the SCAT2 with serial physical examinations provided objective measures for athlete’s injuries, allowing the practitioners to evaluate concussions. More efforts are needed to collect baseline SCAT2 to compare these scores with subsequent SCAT2 scores following athletic injuries. "
"Objective The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the development of the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians (ACBSP) Position Statement on Concussion in Athletics regarding the management of concussion in sport and to offer suggestions to qualifying doctors of chiropractic (DCs) to make return-to-play decisions and clarify common concepts pertaining to evaluating and managing concussion in sport. Methods A literature review of position statements from sports medicine organizations was performed. The authors reviewed each statement for content. Key issues in the management of concussion in sport were identified with special consideration to concussion management by DCs. A position statement on the management of concussion in sport was drafted by the authors and submitted to the Board of Directors of the ACBSP for review. The Board of Directors called for minor revision; and after all revisions were made, the document was resubmitted. The Board of Directors of the ACBSP accepted the document for publication and presentation. The document was presented and disseminated to certificants by the ACBSP at the 2011 Chiropractic Sports Sciences Symposium. Results The 2012 ACBSP Position Statement on Concussion in Athletics was accepted by the ACBSP Board of Directors. Conclusion The Position Statement on Concussion in Athletics has been accepted by the ACBSP. This document offers guidance on the management of concussion in sport and provides qualifying DCs information to make return-to-play decisions. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of engaging in a series of larger studies measuring the effect of sacroiliac joint manipulation on walking kinematics using motion analysis technology. Methods Twelve college students engaged in a baseline 90-second gait analysis at 1.5 mph using infrared VICON cameras. Following this, they underwent a prone heel comparison test for functional leg length inequality. Upon examination, participants were then classified as follows: left short leg, right short leg, or no short leg. Participants in each of the 2 short leg branches of this study were then randomized to receive either chiropractic manipulative therapy to the posterior superior iliac spine on the short limb side or no manipulation. Recruitment was ongoing for this pilot study until 1 participant was recruited in each of the following 5 comparative study groups: left short leg—manipulation, left short leg—no manipulation (control 1), right short leg—manipulation, right short leg—no manipulation (control 2), and no short leg (control 3). All participants then underwent another 90-second gait analysis. Data were then grouped and submitted to a blinded biomechanist to determine if there were any unique biomechanical differences between the groups. Results No statistically significant differences were measured because of this being a pilot study with a small sample size. Conclusions The data from this study indicate that a series of larger studies with this design is feasible. "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe a fifth metatarsal stress fracture that was not detectable using conventional radiographs and was identified with diagnostic ultrasonography (US), confirmed with computed tomography, and followed through symptom resolution with US. Clinical features A 68-year-old woman presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic for evaluation of right foot pain. Diagnostic US examination using an 8- to 15-MHz linear array transducer showed increased vascularity, periosteal elevation, and cortical disruption of the proximal diaphysis of the fifth metatarsal suggestive of a stress fracture. The patient was referred to an orthopedic specialist for comanagement. Intervention and outcome The patient was treated by an orthopedist who confirmed a stress fracture using computed tomography, and she was fit with a short-leg walking boot. Serial US images were obtained to document fracture healing and exclude complications. After 6 months, the patient was asymptomatic and had resumed all of her daily activities. Conclusion We report a case of a proximal fifth metatarsal stress fracture that was visualized with US and followed through symptom resolution by serial examinations. "
"Objective The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the effect of functional lumbar stabilization exercises on pain, disability, and kinesiophobia in women with menstrual low back pain (LBP). Methods Thirty women with menstrual LBP participated in the study. Subjects were assigned to a control group (n = 10, mean age = 25.1 ± 4.7 years) and an intervention group (n = 20, mean age = 21.7±2.4 years). Treatment for the intervention group consisted of functional lumbar stabilization exercises, 10 repetitions each, 3 times a day, for 3 consecutive months. The women in the control group received no exercise and performed their regular activity daily living. Pain intensity using a Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was collected at baseline and at the end of 3 months in both groups. Results Statistical analysis (paired t test) revealed a significant decrease in NPS, ODI, RMQ, and TSK after treatment in the intervention group. No significant difference in NPS, ODI, RMQ, or TSK was found between pre- and postmeasurement scores in the control group. In the analysis of covariance, controlling for pretest scores, a significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the postmeasurement score of NPS (P = .01), ODI (P < .001), RMQ (P = .002), and TSK (P = .04). t P P P P t P P P P Conclusion Lumbar stabilization exercises were shown to improve pain, disability, and kinesiophobia during menstrual LBP for subjects who participated in this preliminary study compared to those who did not receive the intervention.

"Objective The purpose of this pilot study was to collect preliminary information for a study to determine the immediate effects of a single unilateral chiropractic manipulation to the lower cervical spine on handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy in asymptomatic male recreational basketball players. Methods For this study, 24 asymptomatic male recreational right-handed basketball players (age = 26.3 ± 9.2 years, height = 1.81 ± 0.07 m, body mass = 82.6 ± 10.4 kg [mean ± SD]) underwent baseline dominant handgrip isometric strength and free-throw accuracy testing in an indoor basketball court. They were then equally randomized to receive either (1) diversified left lower cervical spine chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) at C5/C6 or (2) placebo CMT at C5/C6 using an Activator adjusting instrument on zero force setting. Participants then underwent posttesting of isometric handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy. A paired-samples t test was used to make within-group pre to post comparisons and between-group pre to post comparisons. t t Results No statistically significant difference was shown between either of the 2 basketball performance variables measured in either group. Isometric handgrip strength marginally improved by 0.7 kg (mean) in the CMT group (P = .710). Free-throw accuracy increased by 13.2% in the CMT group (P = .058). The placebo CMT group performed the same or more poorly during their second test session. P P P P Conclusions The results of this preliminary study showed that a single lower cervical spine manipulation did not significantly impact basketball performance for this group of healthy asymptomatic participants. A slight increase in free-throw percentage was seen, which deserves further investigation. This pilot study demonstrates that a larger study to evaluate if CMT affects handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy is feasible. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize sport concussion incidence data, identify sports that present higher injury frequency, reveal the degree of risk in some lesser-known sports, and outline specific details within the sports literature that raise additional concerns, such as helmet-to-helmet contact and player positions that experience frequent impact. Methods A systematic literature review of Pub Med using keyword search on injury, concussion, and sports was performed through May 2012. Abstracts were identified, selections were made based upon inclusion criteria, and full-length articles were obtained. Additional articles were considered following review of reference sections. Articles were reviewed and tabulated according to sport. Results Two hundred eighty-nine articles were screened, and 62 articles were reviewed. The overall incidence of concussion in sport ranged from 0.1 to 21.5 per 1000 athletic exposures. The lowest incidence was reported in swimming and diving. Concussion incidence was highest in Canadian junior ice hockey, but elevated incidence in American football remains a concern because of the large number of participants. Conclusions The literature reviewed included incidence of concussion on the field of play under real-world conditions and influenced by the current culture of sport. The studies examined in this article show that there is risk of concussion in nearly every sport. Some sports have higher concussion frequency than others, which may depend upon the forces and roles of the positions played in these sports. Younger athletes have a higher incidence of concussion, and female incidence is greater than male in many comparable sports. Headgear may reduce concussion in some sports but may also give athletes a false sense of protection. "
"Objective The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine if a course of chiropractic care would change blood pressure measurements in African American patients and to determine if a study was feasible in a chiropractic teaching clinic. Methods Twenty-four African American patients received chiropractic care in a chiropractic teaching clinic over a study period that spanned 23 visits for each patient. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients having a diagnosis of prehypertension (120-139/80-89) or hypertension stage 1 (140-159/90-99). The mean values of 3 baseline blood pressure readings were compared with the mean values of blood pressure readings taken on visits 21, 22, and 23. Results For the entire sample, reductions for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not statistically significant (P > .07). When 4 patients having body mass index values that were considered as outliers were excluded, a statistically significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed (P = .004). By group, a statistically significant reduction occurred in the hypertension stage 1 group for systolic and diastolic blood pressures. P P P P Conclusion This study showed that research of this nature may be feasible in chiropractic teaching clinics. The preliminary findings of this study showed that, for a subgroup of African American patients receiving chiropractic care, blood pressure decreased for (a) hypertension stage 1 patients and (b) the sample when those with excessive body mass index were excluded. a b a b "
"Objective The purpose of this report is to describe the results of a pregnant woman demonstrating breech fetal presentation who was managed with Webster technique in the presence of oligohydramnios. Clinical Features A 23-year-old primigravida woman sought chiropractic care for the management of breech presentation and bilateral sacroiliac arthralgia at 34 weeks’ gestation. Intervention and Outcome Sacral manipulation and abdominal effleurage (Webster Technique) was used to address breech presentation and sacroiliac arthralgia for a total of 7 treatments over a 3 1/2-week duration. The patient’s sacroiliac pain reduced from 8/10 to 3/10. However, breech presentation was unchanged at each treatment. At a scheduled prenatal surveillance during the 37th week of gestation, the midwife detected vaginal bleeding and reduced fundal height, which resulted in hospitalization, diagnosis of oligohydramnios, and an emergency cesarean delivery. Conclusion For this particular patient, the breech presentation was not corrected using the Webster technique. Clinicians who use the Webster technique to manage breech fetal presentation should be aware of undiagnosed comorbidities as a complicating factor in clinical presentation. Screening for previously undiagnosed comorbidities, such as oligohydramnios, must be considered. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare reported disability due to chronic low back pain following a motor vehicle collision between groups of those using customized foot orthotics and those not using orthotics. Methods Sixty-six consecutive patients referred from primary care medical physicians for the complaint of chronic (> 3 months) low back pain following a motor vehicle collision were included. Thirty patients received “usual care” that included prescription of an exercise therapy program in addition to analgesics. Thirty-four patients received the same therapy along with customized foot orthotics. All patients completed the Oswestry Disability Index at the initiation of the study and at 8-week follow-up. The number of participants using any type of prescription analgesic for their back pain at baseline and at 8 weeks was also recorded. Results All patients completed treatment, and the baseline and 8-week questionnaires. Both treatment groups were well matched in terms of age, sex distribution, and duration of low back pain, as well as baseline Oswestry Disability Index score. At 8 weeks, although both groups had improved, the group that used orthotics had a lower Oswestry Disability Index than the usual care group (P < .05), with a smaller proportion of the orthotics group using any form of prescribed analgesics for back pain (P < .05). P P P P Conclusions In this study, patients with chronic low back pain following a motor vehicle collision who used orthotics in addition to usual care had improved short-term outcomes compared with usual care alone.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to describe changes in anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, and testosterone following a low–energy-density dietary intervention plus regimented supplementation program. Methods The study design was a pre-post intervention design without a control group. Normal participants were recruited from the faculty, staff, students, and community members from a chiropractic college to participate in a 21-day weight loss program. All participants (n = 49; 36 women, 13 men; 31 ± 10.3 years of age) received freshly prepared mostly vegan meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) that included 1200 to 1400 daily calories (5020.8 to 5857.6 J) for the women and 1600 to 1800 (6694.4 to 7531.2 J) daily calories for the men. Nutritional supplements containing enzymes that were intended to facilitate digestion, reduce cholesterol levels, increase metabolic rate, and mediate inflammatory processes were consumed 30 minutes before each meal. The regimented supplementation program included once-daily supplementation with a green drink that contained alfalfa, wheatgrass, apple cider vinegar, and fulvic acid throughout the study period. A cleanse supplementation containing magnesium, chia, flaxseed, lemon, camu camu, cat's claw, bentonite clay, tumeric, pau d'arco, chanca piedra, stevia, zeolite clay, slippery elm, garlic, ginger, peppermint, aloe, citrus bioflavonoids, and fulvic acid was added before each meal during week 2. During week 3, the cleanse supplementation was replaced with probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. Results Multiple paired t tests detected clinically meaningful reductions in weight (− 8.7 ± 5.54 lb) (− 3.9 ± 2.5 kg), total cholesterol (− 30.0 ± 29.77 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (− 21.0 ± 25.20 mg/dL) (P < .05). There was a pre-post intervention increase in testosterone for men (111.0 ± 121.13 ng/dL, P < .05). t P P t P P Conclusions Weight loss and improvements in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurred after a low–energy-density dietary intervention plus regimented supplementation program.

"Objective Betaine supplementation has been shown to be an effective agent for decreasing plasma homocysteine in healthy adults. Studies in healthy volunteers show that 6 g/d of betaine lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations by 5% to 20%. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials that used daily betaine supplementation to identify the range in betaine's effects on lowering homocysteine. Methods Five randomized controlled trials published between 2002 and 2010 were identified using MEDLINE and a manual search. All 5 studies used health adult participants who were supplemented with at least 4 g/d of betaine for between 6 and 24 weeks. A meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects model, and the overall effect size was calculated for changes in plasma homocysteine. Results The pooled estimate of effect for betaine supplementation on plasma homocysteine was a reduction of 1.23 μmol/L, which was statistically significant (95% confidence interval, − 1.61 to − 0.85; P = .01). μ P μ P Conclusion Supplementation with at least 4g/d of betaine for a minimum of 6 weeks can lower plasma homocysteine.

"Objective The purpose of this case series is to describe the treatment and outcomes of a series of patients presenting with frozen shoulder syndrome who received a novel chiropractic approach (OTZ Tension Adjustment). Methods The files of 50 consecutive patients who presented to a private chiropractic practice with frozen shoulder syndrome were reviewed retrospectively. Two primary outcomes were extracted from the files for initial examination and at final evaluation: (1) the 11-point numeric pain rating scale and (2) the percentage change in shoulder abduction. Each patient received a series of chiropractic manipulative procedures that focused on the cervical and thoracic spine. Results Of the case files reviewed, 20 were male and 30 were female; and all were between the ages of 40 and 70 years. The median number of days under care was 28 days (range, 11 to 51 days). The median change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale score was − 7 (range, 0 to − 10). Of the 50 cases, 16 resolved completely (100% improvement), 25 showed 75% to 90% improvement, 8 showed 50% to 75% improvement, and 1 showed 0% to 50% improvement. Conclusion Most patients with frozen shoulder syndrome in this case series appeared to improve with the chiropractic treatment. "
"Introduction This theoretical report gives an example for how coefficient of variation (CV) and quartile analysis (QA) to assess outliers might be able to be used to analyze numeric data in practice for an individual patient. Methods A patient was examined for 8 visits using infrared instrumentation for measurement of mastoid fossa temperature differential (MFTD) readings. The CV and QA were applied to the readings. The participant also completed the Short Form–12 health perception survey on each visit, and these findings were correlated with CV to determine if CV had outcomes support (clinical significance). Results An outlier MFTD reading was observed on the eighth visit according to QA that coincided with the largest CV value for the MFTDs. Correlations between the Short Form–12 and CV were low to negligible, positive, and statistically nonsignificant. Conclusion This case provides an example of how basic statistical analyses could possibly be applied to numerical data in chiropractic practice for an individual patient. This might add objectivity to analyzing an individual patient's data in practice, particularly if clinical significance of a clinical numerical finding is unknown. "
Objective The purpose of this case series is to describe findings for patients with bladder pain syndrome (BPS) or interstitial cystitis (IC) who responded positively under chiropractic care. Clinical Features Eight cases were selected retrospectively reviewed from 2 independent chiropractic clinics in Scotland. Cases were selected if patients reported bladder dysfunction problems and responded positively to chiropractic care. The cases in this report describe the range of patients affected by this condition. Each patient was treated using chiropractic methods that were specific to the individual case. Intervention and Outcomes The patients selected for this case series showed positive response to chiropractic care over various lengths of time and numbers of treatments. Some of the chiropractic patients who had chronic spinal conditions had reoccurrence of bladder symptoms during an exacerbation of mechanical spinal problems. Conclusion This case series highlights that bladder and urinary problems may be associated with spinal dysfunction for some patients. 
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine if thoracolumbar chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) had an immediate impact on exercise performance by measuring blood lactate concentration, exercise heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion during a treadmill-based graded exercise test (GXT). Methods Ten healthy, asymptomatic male and 10 female college students (age = 27.5 ± 3.7 years, height = 1.68 ± 0.09 m, body mass = 71.3 ± 11.6 kg: mean ± SD) were equally randomized into an AB:BA crossover study design. Ten participants were in the AB group, and 10 were in the BA group. The study involved 1 week of rest in between each of the 2 conditions: A (prone Diversified T12-L1 CMT) vs B (no CMT). Participants engaged in a treadmill GXT 5 minutes after each week's condition (A or B). Outcome measures were blood lactate concentration, exercise heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion monitored at the conclusion of each 3-minute stage of the GXT. The exercise test continued until the participant achieved greater than 8 mmol/L blood lactate, which correlates with maximal to near-maximal exercise effort. A dependent-samples t test was used to make comparisons between A and B conditions related to exercise performance. t t Results No statistically significant difference was shown among any exercise response dependent variables in this study. Conclusions The results of this research preliminarily suggest that CMT to T12-L1 does not immediately impact exercise performance during a treadmill-based GXT using healthy college students. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to present radiograph utilization at a chiropractic college teaching clinic, the associated patient demographics, and the utilization rates by body region. Methods Data for outpatient services over a 3-year period were extracted from a college clinic administrative software program. Radiographic data were matched with patient demographic information providing the age, sex, and financial class for all patients. Results The overall radiograph utilization rate was 8%, with the highest frequency occurring in the spine in the order of lumbar, cervical, and then thoracic regions. Spinal radiographs made up 66% of the total radiographs taken. The utilization rate increased as the age of the patients increased. The average patient age was 46, and 48% were female. Conclusion The radiograph utilization rate at this teaching clinic was lower than previous studies. This study provides new information regarding overall and regional radiography rates and associated patient demographics from an American chiropractic college. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to perform a secondary analysis using modified methods of previously reported data to analyze the amount of examiner concordance in the Johnston and Friedman percussion scan of the most fixated spinal level. Method A 2001 study evaluated interexaminer reliability of the percussive method of Johnston and Friedman for detecting altered segmental mobility (somatic dysfunction, spinal/segmental dysfunction, or chiropractic subluxation) in the thoracic spine. The original reported level of agreement using the κ statistic for discrete measures was only 0.07, judged “slight.” The data were reformatted to permit recalculating the degree of interexaminer agreement using the intraclass correlation coefficient statistic, which uses continuous analysis, unlike κ that performs discrete analysis. Following an initial calculation, the data were modified to reflect the caudally increasing vertebral height of the thoracic vertebrae. κ κ κ κ Results The reformatted and modified data, intraclass correlation coefficient (2,1) = 0.253 (0.100,0.482), showed the findings as “poor,” which is better interexaminer agreement for percussion motion palpation than the original reported κ value judged as “slight.” κ κ Conclusions Reanalyzing the data using an alternative statistical method showed greater interexaminer reliability than was originally reported. This secondary analysis demonstrates how study results may vary depending on the experimental design and statistical methods chosen for analysis. "
"Objective Otitis media (OM) is one of the common conditions for doctor visits in the pediatric population. Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) may be a potential conservative treatment of OM. The purpose of this study is to review the literature for OM in children, outlining the diagnosis of OM, SMT description, and adverse event notation. Methods Databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Index to Chiropractic Literature, The Allied and Complementary Medicine, and Alt Health Watch) were queried and hand searches were performed to identify relevant articles. All potential studies were independently screened for inclusion by both authors. The inclusion criteria were as follows: written in the English language, addressed OM, involved human participants 6 years or younger, and addressed SMT. Studies were evaluated for overall quality using standardized checklists performed independently by both authors. Results Forty-nine articles were reviewed: 17 commentaries, 15 case reports, 5 case series, 8 reviews, and 4 clinical trials. Magnitude of effect was lower in higher-quality articles. No serious adverse events were found; minor transient adverse effects were noted in 1 case series article and 2 of the clinical trials. Conclusions From the studies found in this report, there was limited quality evidence for the use of SMT for children with OM. There are currently no evidence to support or refute using SMT for OM and no evidence to suggest that SMT produces serious adverse effects for children with OM. It is possible that some children with OM may benefit from SMT or SMT combined with other therapies. More rigorous studies are needed to provide evidence and a clearer picture for both practitioner and patients. "
"Objective Some doctors and therapists believe that wearing high-heeled shoes causes increased lumbar lordosis and that this may be a cause of low back pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether high-heeled shoes increase lumbar lordosis and to do so with more reliable methods and a larger sample size than used in previous studies. Methods Fifty participants from a chiropractic university were included in a test group (32 female and 18 male) and 9 in a control group (3 female and 6 male). A Spinal Mouse was used to measure lumbar lordosis in test participants barefoot and then again with 3- or 4-in high-heeled shoes after a 10-minute adaptation period of walking and sitting and standing while wearing the shoes. Reliability of the testing conditions was evaluated with 9 barefoot control participants before and after an identical adaptation period, and intra- and interexaminer reliability of Spinal Mouse measurements was tested by use of a wooden model built to mimic the proportions of a human spine. Results Both groups showed non-significant decreases in lordosis between the first and second scans (high heels: 23.4° to 22.8°, P = .17; control: 18.8° to 17.6°, P = .16). Scans of the wooden spine model were highly reliable (intra- and interexaminer intraclass correlation coefficients > .999). P P P P Conclusions Consistent with most previous studies, high-heeled shoes did not affect lumbar lordosis in most people while standing. Future research could investigate the effect of shoes during dynamic conditions or identify affected subgroups. "
"Objective Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is associated with difficult-to-treat infections and high levels of morbidity. Manual practitioners work in environments where MRSA is a common acquired infection. The purpose of this review is to provide a practical overview of MRSA as it applies to the manual therapy professions (eg, physical and occupational therapy, athletic training, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, sports medicine) and to discuss how to identify and prevent MRSA infections in manual therapy work environments. Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus Methods PubMed and CINAHL were searched from the beginning of their respective indexing years through June 2011 using the search terms MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Texts and authoritative Web sites were also reviewed. Pertinent articles from the authors' libraries were included if they were not already identified in the literature search. Articles were included if they were applicable to ambulatory health care environments in which manual therapists work or if the content of the article related to the clinical management of MRSA. MRSA methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus MRSA methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus Results Following information extraction, 95 citations were included in this review, to include 76 peer-reviewed journal articles, 16 government Web sites, and 3 textbooks. Information was organized into 10 clinically relevant categories for presentation. Information was organized into the following clinically relevant categories: microbiology, development of MRSA, risk factors for infection, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, screening tests, reporting, treatment, prevention for patients and athletes, and prevention for health care workers. Conclusion Methicillin-resistant S aureus is a health risk in the community and to patients and athletes treated by manual therapists. Manual practitioners can play an essential role in recognizing MRSA infections and helping to control its transmission in the health care environment and the community. Essential methods for protecting patients and health care workers include being aware of presenting signs, patient education, and using appropriate hand and clinic hygiene. S aureus S aureus "
"Objective There is little high-quality evidence on the efficacy of the Pilates-based exercises for the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a study protocol to investigate the efficacy of adding Pilates-based exercises to a minimum intervention in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. Methods This randomized controlled trial will recruit 86 patients of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, with chronic non-specific low back pain. The participants will be randomly allocated into 2 treatment groups: the Booklet Group, which will receive a booklet with postural orientations, and the Pilates Group, which will receive the same booklet in addition to a Pilates-based exercises program. The general and specific functional capacities of the patient, kinesiophobia, pain intensity, and the global perceived effect will be evaluated by a blinded assessor before randomization and at 6 weeks and 6 months after randomization. In addition, the expectations of the participants and their confidence in the treatment will be evaluated before the randomization and after the first treatment session, respectively. Conclusions It is hoped that the results of this study will provide high-quality evidence on the usefulness of Pilates-based exercises in the treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain. "
"Objective Few studies have analyzed the shapes of pillows. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the pillow shape design and subjective comfort level for asymptomatic subjects. Methods Four basic pillow designs factors were selected on the basis of literature review and recombined into 8 configurations for testing the rank of degrees of comfort. The data were analyzed by the analytic hierarchy process method to determine the most comfortable pillow. Results Pillow number 4 was the most comfortable pillow in terms of head, neck, shoulder, height, and overall comfort. The design factors of pillow number 4 were using a combination of standard, cervical, and shoulder pillows. A prototype of this pillow was developed on the basis of the study results for designing future pillow shapes. Conclusions This study investigated the comfort level of particular users and redesign features of a pillow. A deconstruction analysis would simplify the process of determining the most comfortable pillow design and aid designers in designing pillows for groups. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to report preliminary data on the effects of tea and high-protein meal replacement shakes on weight loss, waist-to-hip ratios, and lipid profiles in healthy subjects. Secondary analyses of urine samples assessed pre-post changes in cellular biochemistry, neurochemistry, and microbial metabolism. Methods This study used a pre-post intervention design without a control group. Thirty healthy subjects (20-60 years of age; 23 women and 7 men) participated in a 28-day diet intervention program consisting of a cleansing day and 6 restricted diet days per week. On cleansing days, the subjects drank 4 oz of tea 4 times per day with a recommendation to drink at least 64 oz of filtered water. On the restricted diet days, the subjects drank 2 high-protein meal replacement shakes, consumed one 400- to 600-cal (1674.3-2511.5 joules) meal consisting of low–glycemic index foods, and drank at least 64 oz of filtered water. Results Multiple paired t tests detected reductions in weight (6.4 lb), waist (1.9 in), and hip (1.1 in) measurements and in total cholesterol (13.3 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11.4 mg/dL) (P < .05). Multiple paired t tests detected significant increases in energy metabolism from carbohydrates and amino acids and concomitant increases in oxidative stress (P < .05). t P t P t P t P Conclusion The data support the concept that a low–glycemic load diet intervention incorporating tea and high-protein meal replacement shakes may cause weight loss and improve lipid profiles. The significant physiologic changes from the urine samples did not reflect meaningful metabolic effects. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether healthy adult volunteers report symptoms following exposure to low-speed frontal crashes at low velocities. Methods Nineteen medically screened, healthy, informed, and willing volunteers (17 men, 2 women; mean age, 37 years) were exposed to low-speed frontal crashes. All volunteers were seated in the rear seat position of the bullet vehicle. Closing velocities ranged from 4.1 to 8.3 mph (mean, 6.7 mph). For the bullet vehicle, the delta V ranged from 1.4 to 3.9 mph with a mean of 2.8 mph. Results Eighty-eight percent of volunteers attributed symptoms of discomfort to their crash exposure. All reported symptoms were transient, and none required medical treatment. The mean duration was 1 day. Conclusions Even at relatively low speeds, there is no lower threshold below which it can be reasonably assumed that healthy and prepared volunteer rear seat passengers will not sustain some level of minor injury in a frontal collision. Although the reported mean delta V for injured persons in real-world frontal crashes has been reported to be as high as 8.1 mph, this does not offer any insight into the minimum threshold for such injuries among all at-risk vehicle occupants.

"Objective Manual muscle testing (MMT) is used for a variety of purposes in health care by medical, osteopathic, chiropractic, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and athletic training professionals. The purpose of this study is to provide a narrative review of variations in techniques, durations, and forces used in MMT putting applied kinesiology (AK) muscle testing in context and highlighting aspects of muscle testing important to report in MMT research. Method PubMed, the Collected Papers of the International College of Applied Kinesiology–USA, and related texts were searched on the subjects of MMT, maximum voluntary isometric contraction testing, and make/break testing. Force parameters (magnitude, duration, timing of application), testing variations of MMT, and normative data were collected and evaluated. Results “Break” tests aim to evaluate the muscle's ability to resist a gradually increasing pressure and may test different aspects of neuromuscular control than tests against fixed resistances. Applied kinesiologists use submaximal manual break tests and a binary grading scale to test short-term changes in muscle function in response to challenges. Many of the studies reviewed were not consistent in reporting parameters for testing. Conclusions To increase the chances for replication, studies using MMT should specify parameters of the tests used, such as exact procedures and instrumentation, duration of test, peak force, and timing of application of force.

"Objective The purpose of this article is to review the literature that discusses normal anatomy and biomechanics of the foot and ankle, mechanisms that may result in a lateral ankle sprain or syndesmotic sprain, and assessment and diagnostic procedures, and to present a treatment algorithm based on normal ligament healing principles. Methods Literature was searched for years 2000 to 2010 in PubMed and CINAHL. Key search terms were ankle sprain$, ankle injury and ankle injuries, inversion injury, proprioception, rehabilitation, physical therapy, anterior talofibular ligament, syndesmosis, syndesmotic injury, and ligament healing. ankle sprain$, ankle injury and ankle injuries, inversion injury, proprioception, rehabilitation, physical therapy, anterior talofibular ligament, syndesmosis, syndesmotic injury, ligament healing ankle sprain$, ankle injury and ankle injuries, inversion injury, proprioception, rehabilitation, physical therapy, anterior talofibular ligament, syndesmosis, syndesmotic injury, ligament healing Discussion Most ankle sprains respond favorably to nonsurgical treatment, such as those offered by physical therapists, doctors of chiropractic, and rehabilitation specialists. A comprehensive history and examination aid in diagnosing the severity and type of ankle sprain. Based on the diagnosis and an understanding of ligament healing properties, a progressive treatment regimen can be developed. During the acute inflammatory phase, the goal of care is to reduce inflammation and pain and to protect the ligament from further injury. During the reparative and remodeling phase, the goal is to progress the rehabilitation appropriately to facilitate healing and restore the mechanical strength and proprioception. Radiographic imaging techniques may need to be used to rule out fractures, complete ligament tears, or instability of the ankle mortise. A period of immobilization and ambulating with crutches in a nonweightbearing gait may be necessary to allow for proper ligament healing before commencing a more active treatment approach. Surgery should be considered in the case of grade 3 syndesmotic sprain injuries or those ankle sprains that are recalcitrant to conservative care. Conclusion An accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment can minimize an athlete's time lost from sport and prevent future reinjury. Most ankle sprains can be successfully managed using a nonsurgical approach. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 2 concentrations of topical, comfrey-based botanical creams containing a blend of tannic acid and eucalyptus to a eucalyptus reference cream on pain, stiffness, and physical functioning in those with primary osteoarthritis of the knee. Methods Forty-three male and female subjects (45-83 years old) with diagnosed primary osteoarthritis of the knee who met the inclusion criteria were entered into the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 10% or 20% comfrey root extract (Symphytum officinale L.) or a placebo cream. Outcomes of pain, stiffness, and functioning were done on the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Participants applied the cream 3× a day for 6 weeks and were evaluated every 2 weeks during the treatment. Symphytum officinale Symphytum officinale Results Repeated-measures analyses of variance yielded significant differences in all of the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index categories (pain P < .01, stiffness P < .01, daily function P < .01), confirming that the 10% and 20% comfrey-based creams were superior to the reference cream. The active groups each had 2 participants who had temporary and minor adverse reactions of skin rash and itching, which were rapidly resolved by modifying applications. P P P P P P Conclusion Both active topical comfrey formulations were effective in relieving pain and stiffness and in improving physical functioning and were superior to placebo in those with primary osteoarthritis of the knee without serious adverse effects.

"Objective Our objective is to document the methodology of a randomized controlled clinical trial that demonstrates sound research methodology. The chiropractic treatment performed may be useful to allow practitioners to adopt a similar approach when treating hip osteoarthritis. Methods This study is a registered, ethics-approved, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Recruitment included a controlled media release, phone screening, and physical assessment to rule out nonosteoarthritic hip pain. Primary outcome measures were the McMaster Overall Therapy Effectiveness Tool and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, which were assessed at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 intervention groups: protocol A or B. Protocol A received preadjustive stretches of hip musculature, followed by hip manipulation. Protocol B received the above intervention, followed by an additional assessment and chiropractic treatment of the lower limb kinetic chain. Participants received 9 treatments and then after 3 months were offered an additional 6 treatments. Statistics will be performed by an independent biostatistician. Results This article provides a valid and reliable protocol for a randomized controlled trial for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis with chiropractic care. Data should be analyzed for statistical significance to provide evidence for the efficacy of the interventions. Conclusions This study is an example of sound research methodology, which was scored as excellent on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Findings may be important in the scope of treatment, providing evidence for conservative management options for hip osteoarthritis. "
"Objective Skin cancer is a major public health concern in the United States. Chiropractic physicians and interns need to recognize and refer patients with atypical moles and skin cancer. The purpose of this study was to test chiropractic interns about their current knowledge, practices, and perceptions of atypical moles and skin cancer. Methods This study was a cross-sectional study using chiropractic interns at 2 chiropractic colleges who received a 26-item survey that used a 5-point Likert scale involving close-ended questions regarding demographics, importance, knowledge, and clinical images regarding atypical moles and skin cancer. Frequencies and odds ratios (ORs) were generated using multiple regression models. Results A total of 217 surveys were collected in the study. The importance of skin cancer recognition as a predictor of practice patterns was examined. Interns who stated it was “important/very important” to recognize skin cancer were slightly more likely to state they “frequently/always” scanned patient's skin on the initial visit, were more likely to state they “frequently/always” scanned on a treatment visit (OR = 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.9), and stated they had noticed a mole that needed follow-up (OR = 3.04; 95% CI, 1.52-6.10). However, interns were no more likely to state they documented moles in the soap notes (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 0.77-2.47) or to know the warning signs of melanoma (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40-1.46). Conclusion As skin cancer continues to increase in prevalence, chiropractic interns can serve in the primary screening process of patients with atypical moles; and chiropractic education should emphasize the opportunity to detect and assess atypical moles as a routine part of primary prevention in clinical education.

"Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine chiropractic patients' perceptions of chiropractors serving as primary care providers and having a limited prescriptive authority. Methods Four doctors of chiropractic in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, NM, participated in surveying their patients during the summer of 2008. The chiropractors distributed the questionnaires consecutively to chiropractic patients. Patients answered questions regarding their perceptions of their chiropractors, use of chiropractic care, and medications for pain. The participating chiropractors collected the completed patient questionnaires and mailed them to the primary investigator. Results The chiropractic providers collected 275 chiropractic patient questionnaires. The number of patient questionnaires collected by each of the 4 participating chiropractors ranged from 35 to 100. The patients primarily sought care for the management and treatment of pain (98.5%), and 57.5% considered that their chiropractors were “primary care providers.” Eighty-five percent preferred that their chiropractor be qualified to prescribe medications and provide hands-on treatment, whereas 97.5% perceived their chiropractors to be chiropractic physicians. Conclusions This small group of chiropractic patients from 4 offices in New Mexico perceived that their doctors of chiropractic were physicians and primary care providers, and 85% preferred that their chiropractor treat patients with limited prescriptive authority when appropriately trained. "
Objective This study describes a model for statistically analyzing follow-up numeric-based chiropractic spinal assessments for an individual patient based on his or her own baseline. Methods Ten mastoid fossa temperature differential readings (MFTD) obtained from a chiropractic patient were used in the study. The first eight readings served as baseline and were compared to post-adjustment readings. Results One of the two post-adjustment MFTD readings fell outside two standard deviations of the baseline mean and therefore theoretically represents improvement according to pattern analysis theory. Conclusion This study showed how standard deviation analysis may be used to identify future outliers for an individual patient based on his or her own baseline data. 
"Objective This study evaluated 3-dimensional (3D) assessments of points of interest on a phantom replica of the human skull and cervical vertebrae to better understand how structures are represented in space using mathematical methods. Methods Three basic geometric equations derived from the “Law of Similar Triangles” are introduced, and measurements are taken after 4 trials to demonstrate how 3D data extracted from 2-dimensional (2D) digitized radiographic pairs can be used to produce coordinate points associated with 3 areas on the atlas. Results An analysis of variance test for multiple group comparison shows no significant statistical difference between 4 trials (P = 0.995). In addition, 6 strong positive correlations are evident using Pearson product-moment coefficient test (r = 0.9008 through 0.9977, P = 0.002). P r P P r P Conclusion This study suggests that it is possible to use coplanar stereoscopic radiographic pairs to define an object's location in 3D space by taking retrospective measurements directly from 2D digitized radiographs.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the 84-in focal film distance anteroposterior (A-P) full spine view to selected sectional views taken at a 40-in focal film distance for angles of divergence and changes produced by lateral translation and variation in source object distance. Methods Computer models were used to determine angles of divergence and study the effects of lateral translation and changes in source object distance. Results Lateral translation produced less projected axial (y-axis) vertebral rotation on the 84-in A-P full spine view than the film at 40 in. Angles of divergence are equal on the 14 × 17-in film at 40 in compared with the 84-in A-P full spine, and 70% of the 84-in full spine view is within the angles of divergence of the 40-in 10 × 12. The 84-in A-P full spine produced lowering and lengthening of the projected ilium when source object distance was reduced. Conclusion In this study, the 84-in A-P full spine produced less projected vertebral rotation on lateral translation. Its angles of divergence were greater than the 40-in 10 × 12 and equal to the 40-in 14 × 17-in film. Except for a 5.4-in section at both the upper and lower margins, the 84-in full spine view was within the angles of divergence of a 40-in 10 × 12. The full spine film produced projected ilium lengthening and lowering. "
"Objective The potential clinical significance of posticus ponticus is controversial because the majority of patients with this finding are asymptomatic. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of posticus ponticus in a chiropractic college clinic patient population. Methods From the archived records in the College Health Center, 304 lateral cervical spine radiographs were randomly selected and assessed by 2 independent examiners for the presence of posticus ponticus in any of its forms. The number of radiographs showing posticus ponticus, as well as analysis of agreement between examiners, was obtained. Results There were 60 radiographs where the examiners disagreed as to the presence or absence of posticus ponticus. These 60 were not counted for prevalence of posticus ponticus but were included in the κ analysis. Among the remaining 246 radiographs, 112 (46%) showed some type of posticus ponticus, whereas 132 (54%) did not show any posticus ponticus finding. Examiners A and B showed a κ score agreement of 0.72, and examiners C and D showed a κ score agreement of 0.51. κ κ κ κ κ κ Discussion The κ scores for both sets of examiners show acceptable agreement. Within this population, the finding of 45.9% prevalence of some type of posticus ponticus was determined. Compared with other studies, the prevalence of posticus ponticus was found to range between 9% and 72%. κ κ Conclusion Within this sample, 45.9% of radiographs showed some type of posticus ponticus.

"Objectives Some women complain of low back pain that they believe is due to wearing high-heeled shoes, and some clinicians seem to think the reason is that high-heeled shoes cause increased lumbar lordosis. This article examines Internet information aimed at the general public and presents a literature review of available research in this area. Methods The keywords high heels and high-heeled shoes, combined with the words lumbar, lordosis, and pelvic tilt, were used in an Internet search of Ask.com; in published literature searches of PubMed, MANTIS, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProceedingsFirst; and in searches for theses and dissertations of PapersFirst through June 2010. high heels high-heeled shoes lumbar lordosis pelvic tilt high heels high-heeled shoes lumbar lordosis pelvic tilt Results There are many Internet sites that support the belief that high-heeled shoes cause increased lordosis. However, published research for this topic mostly does not support this belief; but some mixed results, small subject groups, and questionable methods have left the issue unclear. Conclusions It appears that some health care providers are offering advice about the effect of high-heeled shoes on lumbar lordosis that conflicts with most published research. However, the prevalence of such advice is unknown; and the published research is equivocal. Considering that both low back pain and the wearing of high heeled-shoes are common, clinicians could use some clearer guidance; this is an area that deserves further investigation. "
"Objectives A metatarsal pad is generally considered a useful addition to the orthotic prescription, but anecdotal reports suggest that this element is not prescribed because of patients' reports of excessive discomfort. The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of intolerance to metatarsal pads in a group of patients prescribed customized foot orthotics in a primary care setting. Methods Sixty consecutive patients presenting in a primary care clinic in Edmonton, Canada, with chronic (>3 months), nonspecific, low back pain and/or soft-tissue lower limb disorders were prescribed customized foot orthotics, which in each case included a large metatarsal pad as a routine measure. Patients were educated at the outset that the metatarsal pad may produce initial discomfort, but that this should subside within 1 week and that the pad should be retained if tolerable. All patients were assessed 6 weeks later for their tolerance of the metatarsal pad. Results All subjects completed the 6-week follow-up. The mean age of the sample was 52.6 ± 10.9 years, with 51% male and 49% female. Ten of the 60 subjects reported pain and/or discomfort that they related to the presence of the metatarsal pad beyond 1 week after initial use and requested adjustment or removal of the metatarsal pad. With reassessment and education, addressing problems of inadequate shoe size or a need for reassurance to persist with orthotic use, only 1 required adjustment to the metatarsal pad to continue orthotic use. Conclusions A group of primary care patients prescribed customized foot orthotics seemed to tolerate a large metatarsal pad. This suggests that metatarsal pads should not be avoided or immediately removed in customized orthotics because of initial discomfort, as this discomfort may be transient or responds to reassurance and education.

"Objective Obesity is a major health problem in the United States. Skinfold measurements are routinely used in assessing outcomes in the management of obesity. The purpose of this study was to determine if sex differences in skinfold measurements would be apparent in intraobserver and interobserver reliability as well as validity when compared with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements. Methods To determine intraobserver and interobserver variability, 71 male and 45 female subjects (chiropractic students) were assessed by 4 separate observers who each took 4 separate skinfold measurements. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was later conducted using a foot-to-foot technique. The average sums of the skinfold measurement and their standard deviations were calculated, and correlation coefficients between skinfold measurements and BIA techniques for male and female subjects were plotted separately to assess validity. Results Men tended to have greater amounts of intraobserver and interobserver variability when compared with women, but these differences were not significant. In regard to validity, there was no significant difference between skinfold measurements and BIA when estimating percentage body fat for men; but the difference was significant for women, where BIA underestimated by 3.4%. Conclusions The differences observed in variability could be explained by the fact that there is a difference in skinfold compressibility between men and women. Physicians who are using skinfold calipers for body composition assessment should take into account these small potential differences when evaluating total body fatness. "
"Objective Inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have not been evaluated in response to a short course of lumbar spinal manipulation. The purpose of this study is to observe the responses of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) after a series of 9 chiropractic spinal manipulations. Methods Twenty-one participants were assigned to a treatment or a control group. Only the treatment group received 9 chiropractic interventions. Pre- and postintervention measures were recorded for blood samples for detection of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CRP. Results Mediators of inflammation (IL-6 and high-sensitivity CRP) were modified by the intervention received in the treatment group, and the effect size demonstrated a tendency toward the control group values. Conclusion A total of 9 chiropractic lower back manipulations caused the mediators of inflammation to present a normalization response in individuals suffering from chronic low back pain. "
"Objective Motion palpation is integral to most chiropractic techniques and can be found in curricula of most every chiropractic college. Paradoxically, most studies do not show strong reliability for motion palpation. The purpose of this study was to determine if allowing motion palpators to rate their confidence in their findings, as well using a continuous data analytic method, would influence the level of concordance. Methods Subjects were 52 asymptomatic chiropractic student volunteers. Two palpators assessed posterior to anterior glide of T3-10 in the prone position, alternating in their order and blinded as to each other's results. Each examiner identified the location of maximal restriction in this range and also whether they were “very confident” or “not confident” in their finding. Results For all subjects combined, the examiners' calls were “poor”: intraclass correlation coefficient [2,1] = .3110 (95% CI, .0458-.5358). In contrast, interexaminer agreement was “good” when both examiners were very confident: intraclass correlation coefficient [2,1] = .8266 (95% CI, 0.6257-0.9253). Conclusion When each examiner was “very confident” as to the most fixated thoracic segment, the levels they identified were very close. This corresponds to “good” agreement, an uncommon result in most interexaminer motion palpation studies. Thus, the confidence level of examiners had an effect on the interexaminer reliability of thoracic spine. Our novel continuous measures, statistical methodology, and subtyping the subjects according to the confidence of the palpators seem more capable than level-by-level discrete analysis of detecting interexaminer agreement.

"Objective The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of poorly understood and underresearched neuroanatomy of selected pyramidal cells of the medial wall of the cingulate gyrus. Methods A literature review was performed; and separate computerized literature searches of PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and the World Wide Web were used for each cell type using individual set time scales for the discovery of each cell. A narrative overview of the literature was developed using information from searches of computerized databases and authoritative texts. Discussion The medial walls of the cerebral hemispheres, notably the cingulate gyri, contain species-specific neuron fields that to date are not well known within the scientific community and yet have been implicated as the underlying cause of such varying conditions as dysgraphia and autism in children and obsessive-compulsive disorder and Alzheimer disease in adults. As these neurons are late to develop both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, it has been suggested that they may be particularly vulnerable to stressors that potentially could be an underlying factor in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Conclusion It is considered that knowledge of these little-known pyramidal fields of the medial wall of the human brain is essential to the understanding of how the brain functions both in sickness and in health.

"Objective The purpose of this literature review is to critically review the evidence for chiropractic as a treatment of primary insomnia. Methods A search of the following databases up to October 2006 was conducted: PubMed, PEDro, MANTIS, CINAHL, and the specialized register of the Cochrane review group. We also performed hand searching of relevant journals. Randomized clinical trials, clinical trials, and case studies of chiropractic treatment of insomnia were included. It was required that each study used at least one form of standard patient outcome measure. Treatment strategies included manual therapy such as spinal manipulative therapy or muscle relaxation techniques. The review focused on articles published in indexed, peer-reviewed journals. Results Fifteen studies met the selection criteria. There were no randomized clinical trials specific to chiropractic and insomnia. One study was a survey of opinion for treatment regimens for insomnia, which had low methodological scores. Another study assessed osteopathic cranial manipulation for insomnia, which appeared to have positive effects. Four studies identified physiotherapy treatment and manual therapy. A further 9 studies related to mind-body medical therapies and impaired health status, sleep disorders, and pain in the craniomandibular and cervical spinal regions. Conclusion Some studies have noted improvement in insomnia following manual therapy; however, based on clinical trials, there is minimal evidence of support for chiropractic in insomnia. Further studies with high methodological scores need to be conducted. "
"Objective The purpose of this literature review was to synthesize the existing literature on various definitions, classifications, selection criteria, and outcome measures used in different studies in patients with neck pain. Methods A literature search of MEDLINE and CINAHL through September 2008 was performed to gather articles on the reliability, validity, and utility of a wide variety of outcome measurements for neck pain. Results Different types of definitions appear in the literature based on anatomical location, etiology, severity, and duration of symptoms. Classifications according to severity and duration of pain and the establishment of selection criteria seem to play a crucial role in study designs and in clinical settings to ensure homogeneous groups and effective interventions. A series of objective tests and subjective self-report measures are useful in assessing physical abilities, pain, functional ability, psychosocial well-being, general health status, and quality of life in patients with neck pain. Self-administered questionnaires are commonly used in clinical practice and research projects. Conclusions Because of multidimensionality of chronic neck pain, more than just one index may be needed to gain a complete health profile of the patient with neck pain. The instruments chosen should be reliable, valid, and able to evaluate the effects of treatment. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intraexaminer reliability of the Blair protractoview radiographic method. Methods This retrospective study evaluated 25 participants attending a Blair technique seminar. Participants included chiropractic students and doctors of chiropractic with more than 11 years of experience. Participants evaluated 100 Blair protractoview radiographs (oblique nasium). A κ analysis was used to determine the inter- and intraexaminer reliability because of the nominal categorical value of the variables. For the interexaminer reliability, a κ score was given for each examiner combination. The scores were then averaged to give the total interexaminer reliability. κ κ κ κ Results The overall interexaminer reliability showed substantial reliability at 0.62. Within-group κ values were as follows: no certification = 0.61, proficiency = 0.66, primary level = 0.61, and advanced level = 0.74. The overall intraexaminer reliability showed outstanding reliability at 0.81. Within-group κ values were as follows: no certification = 0.76, proficiency = 0.84, primary level = 0.82, and advanced level = 0.92. All κ values had a P value < .001. κ κ κ P κ κ κ P Conclusion The participants in this study showed good inter- and intraexaminer reliability using the Blair protractoview radiographic method. "
"Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in results (strong/facilitated vs weak/functionally inhibited) between short (1 second) and long (3 seconds) manual muscle tests (MMTs) on the same subject and to pilot the use of thin-film force transducers for characterizing the parameters of MMT and for measuring maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). Method Forty-four healthy chiropractic students were tested. A thin-film force transducer recorded force over time during MVIC of the middle deltoid and 1- and 3-second MMTs of the same subjects. The MMTs were graded as strong (able to resist the testing pressure) or weak (unable to resist testing pressure, breaking away). Results Forty-two short tests were strong, and 2 were weak. Thirty-nine long tests were strong, and 5 were weak. κ (0.54) showed fair agreement for results between short and long tests. Peak force in both short and long weak tests was higher than that in strong tests when expressed as a proportion of maximum contraction. All manual tests used less force than MVICs. κ κ Conclusions This study demonstrated that a study of this nature is feasible. Longer test durations demonstrate some muscle weaknesses that are not evident on 1-second MMTs. Thin-film transducers show promise for recording MMT parameters for research purposes. "
"Objective There has been a steady growth of chiropractic treatment using spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) that aims to increase the performance of athletes in various sports. This study evaluates the effect of SMT by chiropractors on the performance of golf players. Methods Golfers of 2 golf clubs in São Paulo, Brazil, participated in this study. They were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: Group I received a stretch program, and group II received a stretch program in addition to SMT. Participants in both groups performed the same standardized stretching program. Spinal manipulative therapy to dysfunctional spinal segments was performed on group II only. All golfers performed 3 full-swing maneuvers. Ball range was considered as the average distance for the 3 shots. Treatment was performed after the initial measurement, and the same maneuvers were performed afterward. Each participant repeated these procedures for a 4-week period. Student t test, Mann-Whitney nonparametric test, and 1-way analysis of variance for repeated measures with significance level of 5% were used to analyze the study. t t Results Forty-three golfers completed the protocol. Twenty participants were allocated to group I and 23 to group II. Average age, handicap, and initial swing were comparable. No improvement of full-swing performance was observed during the 4 sessions on group I (stretch only). An improvement was observed at the fourth session of group II (P = .005); when comparing the posttreatment, group II had statistical significance at all phases (P = .003). P P P P Conclusions Chiropractic SMT in association with muscle stretching may be associated with an improvement of full-swing performance when compared with muscle stretching alone. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a chiropractic practice-based research network to investigate the treatment of acute neck pain (ANP) and to report resulting findings. Methods Participating chiropractors recruited sequentially presenting ANP patients on their initial visit to the office. Patients were treated by the chiropractors using their usual methods. Data were prospectively collected by having patients complete the Neck Disability Index, Characteristic Pain Intensity score, and a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Questionnaires were completed during routine office visits at baseline and then at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 26, either in the office or by mail. Results Ten chiropractors supplied data on 99 patients. The number of cases contributed by each of the participating chiropractors ranged from 1 to 54, with a mean (SD) of 9.2 (10.5). Mean (SD) Neck Disability Index scores were 36 (17.9) at baseline and 9.8 (12.2) at the final evaluation; the Characteristic Pain Intensity scores were initially 55.3 (20.4) and were 24.5 (21.5) at the final evaluation. Transient minimal adverse effects were reported by chiropractors for only 7 (7.8%) patients. No serious adverse reactions were reported. Conclusion The practice-based research methodology used in this study appears to be a feasible way to investigate chiropractic care for ANP, and its methodologies could be used to plan future research.

"Objective This feasibility study was conducted to further the development of a line of investigation into the potential effects of spinal manipulation/manual therapy on cervicogenic dizziness, balance, and neck pain in adults. Methods A single-group, preexperimental, feasibility study was conducted at a chiropractic college health center and a senior fitness center with a target sample size of 20 patients (40 years or older). Patients were treated by either a clinician or a chiropractic student intern for 8 weeks. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was the primary outcome measurement, with the Short Form Berg Balance Scale (SF-BBS) and the Neck Disability Index used as secondary outcome measurements. Results Twenty-seven patients were recruited over a period of 13 months. Twenty-one patients enrolled in the study; but because of 2 dropouts, 19 patients completed the treatment. A median Dizziness Handicap Inventory change score of +7 points was calculated for those dizziness patients, with 3 patients improving by at least 18 points, indicating a clinically meaningful change. Seven of the 15 patients who performed the SF-BBS attained at least a 4-point improvement with an effect size of 1.2. A median Neck Disability Index change score of +1 was calculated for those patients with neck pain. Twelve minor adverse reactions were reported by 8 patients, with 3 of those reactions lasting longer than 24 hours. Conclusion A large effect size was calculated for the SF-BBS. Most patients demonstrated improved balance, and some showed reduced dizziness and neck pain. Involving interns in care proved feasible. Further studies with comparison groups and larger samples are needed to explore the promising results of this study before any cause and effect relationship can be determined. "
"Objective The purpose of this article is to offer a narrative review and discuss the possible relationship between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and whiplash injuries. Methods Databases from 1966 to present were searched including PubMed; Manual, Alternative, and Natural Therapy Index System; and Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Search terms used included whiplash injury, temporomandibular disorders and craniomandibular disorders. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies on orofacial pain of a musculoskeletal origin addressing the following topics: posttraumatic temporomandibular disorder (pTMD) incidence and prevalence, mechanism of injury, clinical findings and characteristics, prognosis (including psychologic factors). Excluded were studies of orofacial pain from nontraumatic origin, as well as nonmusculoskeletal causes including neurologic, vascular, neoplastic, or infectious disease. whiplash injury temporomandibular disorders craniomandibular disorders whiplash injury temporomandibular disorders craniomandibular disorders Results Thirty-two studies describing the effects of whiplash on TMD were reviewed based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The best evidence from prospective studies indicates a low to moderate incidence and prevalence. Only 3 studies addressed mechanism of injury theories. Most studies focusing on clinical findings and characteristics suggest significant differences when comparing pTMD to idiopathic/nontraumatic patients. Regarding prognosis, most studies suggest a significant difference when comparing pTMD to idiopathic/nontraumatic TMD patients, with pTMD having a poorer prognosis. Conclusions There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of whiplash on the development of TMD. Furthermore, because of lack of homogeneity in the study populations and lack of standardization of data collection procedures and outcomes measured, this review cannot conclusively resolve the controversies that exist concerning this relationship. This review of the literature is provided to clarify the issues and to provide useful clinical information for health care providers managing TMD such as doctors of chiropractic, physical therapists, dentists, and medical doctors.

"Objective This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a fruit and vegetable powder mix on cardiovascular health as determined by blood pressure and heart rate variability (HRV) in a chiropractic college faculty and student population. Methods Forty subjects were recruited in the study via a schoolwide e-mail notification and through personal contacts. NanoGreens (Biopharma Scientific, Inc, San Diego, CA) vegetable supplement drink was tested to document its effect on the blood pressure and HRV in relation to cardiovascular health. Results After taking the supplement for 90 days, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly in the treatment group. The systolic blood pressure decreased from 140.4 ± 17.7 to 128 ± 14.2 mm Hg, and the diastolic blood pressure decreased from 90.2 ± 7.7 to 83.1 ± 7.4 mm Hg. No significant blood pressure decrease was observed in the control group (systolic blood pressure from 130.8 ± 16.3 to 131 ± 16.1 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure from 83.6 ± 9.6 to 83.1 ± 7.9 mm Hg). Subject's body weight in pounds did not change significantly in the experimental group: from 193.5 ± 31.1 to 194 ± 31.3. The body weight in the control group showed an increase from 175.9 ± 27.4 to 178 ± 29.9, but it was not significant. The heart rate did not show any statistically significant changes. Time domain analysis of HRV showed an increase in the standard deviation of the average R-R intervals root mean square of successive interbeat intervals, but it did not reach statistical significance. Frequency analysis of HRV found an increase in the total power, but it did not reach a significant level. Conclusion It was concluded that taking the nutritional supplement for 90 days reduced blood pressure but not body weight in this group of subjects. The HRV was not affected by the supplement over the 3-month period. Larger studies should be conducted to determine effects on other populations. "
"Objective This study examined a set of patients who were symptomatic for low back pain and who had significant lumbar hypolordosis as assessed by visual evaluation of magnetic resonance images to investigate the frequency of comorbid paraspinal muscle spasms as determined via history or physical examination. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on 50 patients who had significant hypolordosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Cobb angle <20°) to determine whether they were positive for paraspinal muscle spasms by either history or physical examination. Results Of the 50 patients with significant hypolordosis on MRI, 66% (33) had a history of paraspinal muscle spasms, 76% (38) had a positive physical examination for palpation of paraspinal muscle spasms, and 48% (24) were positive for both history and physical examination. Conclusions This retrospective study suggests that most symptomatic patients with significant hypolordosis on lumbar MRI have a positive history or physical examination for paraspinal muscle spasm. Thus, MRI finding of significant hypolordosis (Cobb angle <20°) could potentially be a valuable tool in addition to medical history and physical examination in aiding clinicians in diagnosing paraspinal muscle spasms in symptomatic patients and in helping them to formulate appropriate and effective treatments.

"Objective Although it is common to find assertions relating functional leg length inequality (LLI) to pelvic torsion and other states of subluxation, comments and/or data concerning anatomical LLI in this same context are uncommon. This review of the literature synthesizes the evidence on pelvic torsion in relation to anatomical LLI. Methods The literature was searched using the PubMed; Manual, Alternative, and Natural Therapy Index System; Allied and Complementary Medicine Database; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; and Index to Chiropractic Literature databases for primary studies that related LLI, either artificially created or naturally occurring, to pelvic torsion. Extracted data included natural vs artificial LLI, method of creating or detecting LLI, subject selection, methodology for measuring pelvic torsion, and results. Results Nine English-language studies were retrieved published 1936-2004. Seven determined the impact of artificial, transient LLI on pelvic torsion, whereas 2 studied the effect of naturally occurring LLI. Conclusion Across varying methodologies for measuring LLI and pelvic torsion, a consistent, dose-related pattern was identified in which the innominate rotates anteriorly on the side of a shorter leg and posteriorly on the side of the longer leg. This finding was contrary to the common assertion that the ilium rotates posteriorly on the side of a short leg and vice versa. Practitioners of manual medicine who derive vectors for intervention based on leg checking procedures should consider the possibility that the direction of pelvic torsion may be variable depending on whether the LLI is of anatomical or functional origin.

"Objective Most whiplash patients eventually recover, although some are left with ongoing pain and impairment. Why some develop long-term symptoms after whiplash, whereas others do not, is largely unknown. One explanation blames the cultural expectations of the population wherein the injury occurred, engendering the moniker whiplash culture. The purpose of this review was to locate and discuss studies that were used as a basis for developing the whiplash culture concept and to evaluate its plausibility. whiplash culture whiplash culture Methods The PubMed database was searched using combinations of the terms whiplash culture, whiplash OR WAD, and chronic OR late OR long term. Search dates spanned from 1950 to June 2008. Filters were set to only retrieve English-language citations. Articles that dealt with the whiplash culture were selected and examined to determine which studies had been used to create the concept. whiplash culture whiplash OR WAD chronic OR late OR long term whiplash culture whiplash OR WAD chronic OR late OR long term Results Nineteen articles discussed the cultural aspects of whiplash and were explored to determine which were used as a basis for the whiplash culture. Eight studies were found that met this final criterion. Conclusion There are many unanswered questions about the basis of chronic whiplash, and the notion of a whiplash culture is controversial. Chronic whiplash symptoms are surely not caused entirely by cultural issues, yet they are probably not entirely physical. Presumably, a tissue injury component exists in most chronic whiplash-associated disorder victims that becomes aggravated in those who are susceptible to biopsychosocial factors. As with many other controversial health care topics, the answer to the debate probably lies somewhere in the middle. "
"Objectives The objectives of this study were to determine factors that may affect satisfaction levels of participants in a nonclinic (sport) setting through participant observation and participation. Factors associated with general satisfaction (observed) were determined along with a participant demographic profile, participant knowledge about chiropractic, and satisfaction with treatment received from a chiropractic student. Thereafter, the relationships between the demographic factors, participant knowledge, and participant general satisfaction were determined. Lastly, factors affecting satisfaction levels were compared between the participants and the observers. Methods An exploratory mixed-method observational study that compared results reported by 30 participants and 2 observers, regarding the treatment process, by completion of a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical significance was set at P less than or equal to .05. P P Results Of the 30 participants, 83.3% were South African, 90% were white, and 63.3% were male, with a mean age of 35.6 years, who reported they were very satisfied with chiropractic care (P = .229). The only factor to produce a significant difference between participants and observers was communication (P = .082 with Spearman = .332). P P P P Conclusion In this study, communication had the greatest impact; therefore, it is suggested that positive verbal and nonverbal communication be emphasized in the training of future chiropractic professionals.

"Objective The objective of this article was to review the literature on the use of chiropractic for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Methods A literature search was conducted on 4 electronic databases (Medline, Index to Chiropractic Literature, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) for clinical research pertaining to chiropractic treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Retrieved articles were hand searched for relevant references. Inclusion criteria consisted of any clinical study design (including case reports) using chiropractic care on patients with lumbar spinal stenosis published in English in the past 25 years. Results Six articles on a total of 70 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. These articles included 4 case studies, a case series, and an observational cohort study. Treatments included spinal manipulation and, most often, flexion-distraction manipulation. Numerous other interventions including exercise, activity of daily living modifications, and various passive care modalities were selectively used in the included studies. Conclusions There is a paucity of evidence available with respect to chiropractic treatment of spinal stenosis. The limited evidence that is available points toward chiropractic care being potentially beneficial in the treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, but further clinical investigations are necessary.

"Objective Vertebral asymmetries can present a challenge to analysis of the anatomical and biomechanical misalignment component of chiropractic vertebral subluxation. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of asymmetry among 10 natural bone atlas specimens using radiographic analysis. Methods Ten natural atlas bone specimens' images were recorded using a digital radiographic system, and evaluations were made by 2 independent examiners using the system's software. Mean differences, standard deviations, and agreements were evaluated in regard to bilateral differences. Results The mean bilateral difference for both examiners was 0.96 mm, with a standard deviation of ±0.67 mm. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean values for left and right measurements. Discussion The mean of 0.96 ± 0.67 mm indicates that measurements up to 1.63 mm (1 SD) or 2.30 mm (2 SDs) are clearly within a reference range of variation for this sample. This information could be used to assist the clinician measuring lateral misalignment of the atlas in determining the amount of expected normal asymmetry for the individual patient before concluding that lateral misalignment of the atlas is present. Conclusions These 10 specimens showed an average difference of 0.95 mm ± 1 SD (0.67 mm) or 2 SDs (1.34 mm) between the left and right sides of the atlas vertebrae. Differences found on radiographs may be due to asymmetry and not actual misalignment. On the average, for these 10 vertebra specimens, a lateral disposition of 1.62 mm on either side should be allowed when arriving at a conclusion for lateral displacement of the atlas. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine if an orthopedic pelvic blocking procedure affects cervical spine extensor isometric strength. Methods Twenty-two participants were sequentially assigned into treatment and control groups. Treatment consisted of a 2-minute procedure using orthopedic blocks (padded wedges with a 45° incline) that were placed bilaterally under the ilia as determined by leg length assessment. Isometric strength measurements took place in 2 sessions with a day of rest between. The treatment group received therapy at the second session immediate to postisometric measures. Results Outcome measures were the pre- and posttreatment measurements of cervical isometric extension strength in pounds. The t tests showed no statistically significant difference between groups in isometric extension strength before treatment. One-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference between groups after treatment (F1,21 = 7.174, P = .014). The treatment group demonstrated an average increase of 6.35 (8.18) lb in extensor strength. t 1,21 P t 1,21 P Conclusions The current study showed a statistically significant change in cervical isometric extensor strength after sacroiliac joint blocking.

"Objective This study compared sleep quality and stress-related symptoms between older beds (≥5 years) and new bedding systems. Methods A convenience sample of healthy subjects (women = 30; men = 29) with minor musculoskeletal sleep-related pain and compromised sleep, but with no clinical history of disturbed sleep, participated in the study. Subjects recorded back discomfort and sleep quality upon waking for 28 consecutive days in their own beds (baseline) and for 28 consecutive days (post) on a new bedding system using visual analog scales. Following baseline measures, participant's beds were replaced by new, medium-firm beds, and they again rated their sleep quality and back discomfort. Stress was assessed by a modified stress questionnaire. Results Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to treat sleep quality and efficiency and factored responses of the stress items. Results indicated that the subjects' personal bedding systems average 9.5 years old and were moderately priced. Significant (P < .01) improvements were found between pre- and posttest mean values in sleep quality and efficiency. Continued improvement was noted for each of the 4-week data gathering period. Stress measures yielded similar positive changes between pre- and posttest mean values. P P Conclusion Based on these data, it was concluded that, in this population, new bedding systems increased sleep quality and reduced back discomfort, factors that may be related to abatement of stress-related symptoms.

"Objective The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature and other authoritative sources for recommendations regarding the appropriateness of physical and sporting activity for those with scoliosis. Methods The literature was systematically searched in PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Index to Chiropractic Literature, and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse from the earliest date of each database through July 2008. All languages and research designs were included. Web sites of respected organizations were searched for position/white papers on scoliosis and physical activity. Included articles were rated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria, and recommendations for physical activity were made using the Oxford Centre's criteria for grades of recommendation. Results Of 42 articles retrieved, 11 met the inclusion criteria. The Internet review of 18 organizations yielded no previous guidelines or position papers for physical activity and scoliosis. Recommendations were made from 3 level 3b studies and 8 level 5 studies; they include the following: (1) brace-treated and surgically treated scoliosis patients have demonstrated that they can physically participate in physical activities at the same level as nonsurgical patients (grade C recommendation); (2) nonsurgically treated patients are encouraged to participate in sports and physical activity and (3) scoliosis is not a contraindication to participation in most sports (grade D recommendation); (4) brace-treated scoliosis patients are encouraged to exercise with their brace on; however, exercise may also be done outside of the brace (grade D recommendation); and (5) physical activity may be commenced after surgery for scoliosis; however, no high-quality evidence exists that guides the timing of return to physical activity (grade D recommendation). A potential association between elite-level competition in specific sports at an early age and an increased prevalence of scoliosis has been reported (grade C recommendation). Conclusion This article offers evidence-based guidance to health care providers and to patients with scoliosis when making decisions to participate in physical and sporting activities. "
"Objective Folic acid supplementation has been shown to be an effective agent for improving endothelial function, a prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease; but its effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals has been met with mixed results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the effect of high-dose folic acid supplementation on blood pressure and endothelial function in hypertensive patients. Methods Twelve randomized controlled trials published between 1970 and December 2007 were identified using Medline and a manual search. All 12 studies used hypertensive subjects who were supplemented with at least 5000 μg/d of folic acid for between 2 and 16 weeks. Three separate meta-analyses were carried out using a random-effects model, and the overall effect sizes were calculated for changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and for changes in endothelial function as measured through the percentage of change in flow-mediated dilation. μ μ Results The pooled estimate of effect of folic acid supplementation on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was −2.03 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], −3.63 to −0.43; P = .04) and 0.01 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.12 to 1.13; not significant), respectively. The pooled estimate of effect of folic acid supplementation on change in flow-mediated dilation was 1.61% (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.96; P = .000). P P P P Conclusion Based upon the studies used in this meta-analysis, supplementation with at least 5000 μg/d of folic acid, for a minimum of 6 weeks, can lower systolic blood pressure slightly; but the real clinical benefit is achieved through improved endothelial function. μ μ "
"Objective By nature, chiropractic is a hands-on profession using manipulation applied to the joints with direct skin-to-skin contacts. Chiropractic tables are designed with a face piece to accommodate the prone patient's head in a neutral position and hand rests to allow for relaxed shoulders and upper spine so treatment is facilitated. The purpose of this article is to present a proposed guideline for hand and treatment table surface sanitizing for the chiropractic profession that is evidence-based and can easily be adopted by teaching institutions and doctors in the field. Methods A review of the chiropractic literature demonstrated that pathogenic microbes are present on treatment tables in teaching clinics at multiple facilities, yet no standardized protocols exist in the United States regarding table sanitizing and hand hygiene in chiropractic clinics or education institutions. This article reviews the scientific literature on the subject by using several search engines, databases, and specific reviews of documents pertaining to the topic including existing general guidelines. Results The literature has several existing guidelines that the authors used to develop a proposed protocol for hand and table sanitizing specific to the chiropractic profession. Recommendations were developed and are presented on hand hygiene and table sanitizing procedures that could lower the risk of infection for both clinical personnel and patients in chiropractic facilities. Conclusion This article offers a protocol for hand and table sanitizing in chiropractic clinics and education institutions. The chiropractic profession should consider adoption of these or similar measures and disseminate them to teaching clinics, institutions, and private practitioners. "
"Objective Arterial hypertension is considered a major contributor to coronary arterial disease. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of Hans electrical stimulation of acupuncture points on blood pressure. Methods Subjects with normal and elevated blood pressure were recruited and randomly assigned into control and experimental groups. Only the experimental subjects received active Hans electrical stimulation on 2 acupuncture points for 30 minutes each session, twice a week for 5 weeks. Results Twenty-seven subjects (17 male) were recruited and completed the study. The average age of the subjects was 25 ± 5 years. The youngest subject was 20 years old and the oldest was 36 years old. After using the Hans electrical stimulation on acupuncture points for 5 weeks, the systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in the experimental group with active treatment. The mean systolic blood pressure was 117.8 ± 4.2 mm Hg before the treatment and was reduced to 110.8 ± 5.5 mm Hg (P < .05) in the third week and to 110.1 ± 5.8 mm Hg in the fifth week (P < .05). The mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.1 ± 5.0 mm Hg before treatment and was reduced to 77.4 ± 4.3 mm Hg (P > .05) in the third week and to 74.8 ± 4.3 mm Hg (P > .05) in the fifth week, but both did not reach statistically significant levels. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the control group did not show statistically significant changes. The mean systolic blood pressure was 115.6 ± 13.3 mm Hg before the treatment and was reduced to 113.0 ± 12.6 mm Hg (P > 0.05) in the third week and to 112.2 ± 10.3 mm Hg in the fifth week (P > .05). The mean diastolic blood pressure was 76.4 ± 7.9 mm Hg before treatment and was reduced to 76.5 ± 6.9 mm Hg (P > .05) in the third week and to 73.9 ± 5.4 mm Hg (P > .05) in the fifth week.

"Objective Outcome measures with good reliability, validity, responsiveness, and low burden of administration are clinically useful. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures for individuals with low back pain. Psychometric properties of the ODI will determine the questionnaire's suitability as a useful clinical tool. Methods A literature search of relevant databases on psychometric evaluation of the ODI was performed. The search was done using the key words disability evaluation, and low back pain, and questionnaires, and reproducibility of results, and the term Oswestry. Inclusion criterion was direct reference regarding psychometric property, interpretability, and burden being included in the abstract. disability evaluation low back pain questionnaires reproducibility of results Oswestry disability evaluation low back pain questionnaires reproducibility of results Oswestry Results Eight articles met the inclusion criterion. The ODI shows good construct validity; internal consistency is rated as acceptable; test-retest reliability and responsiveness have been shown to be high; and burden of administration is low. Conclusions The ODI is a valid, reliable, and responsive condition-specific assessment tool that is suited for use in clinical practice. It is easy to administer and score, objectifies clients' complaints, and monitors effects of therapy. "
"Objective This study reports on the effects of laser acupuncture on blood pressure, body weight, and heart rate variability by stimulating acupuncture points and meridians on college students and faculty members. Methods Forty-five students and faculty members from a chiropractic college were recruited in the study. All subjects signed a written informed consent before their participation in the study. This study was a randomized controlled pilot study with subjects divided into control and experimental groups. The control group received a sham low-level laser therapy treatment with no power output to the laser during their “treatment.” The experimental group was treated with an activated laser. The acupuncture points used in this study were LI 4 and LI 11 for body weight and blood pressure. The treatment groups received 16 J of laser energy output for a total treatment time of 8 minutes (4 minutes for each of the 2 points). Results After using the laser treatment for 90 days (at least 12 treatments per subject), both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P < .01). The mean systolic blood pressure was 129.6 ± 14.7 mm Hg before the treatment and was reduced to 122.5 ± 17.2 mm Hg (P < .001). The mean diastolic blood pressure was 85.6 ± 8.0 mm Hg before treatment and was reduced to 77.2 ± 8.7 mm Hg (P < .001). Subject's body weight was reduced in the active acupoint group, but the weight reduction did not reach a significant level. There were no significant changes in the heart rate variability. P P P P P P Conclusion It was concluded that low-level laser treatment of acupoint resulted in lower blood pressure by stimulating the LI 11 and LI 4. No significant difference was observed in both the body weight and heart rate variability after the laser acupoint treatment. "
"Objective Low back disorders (LBDs) are the most common complaint among workers; therefore, many questions arise about cost-effective treatment approaches. This investigation evaluated the differences in cost-related factors among a population of patients selecting chiropractic vs allopathic care for the treatment of nonspecific LBDs. The study hypothesis was that chiropractic care would be more cost-effective or equivalent to allopathic care for the noncomplicated LBDs. Methods Cases were extracted from an insurance company database of patients reporting work-related low back injuries who were treated with either chiropractic or allopathic approaches. Cases were matched using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 722 (intervertebral disk disorders), 724 (other and unspecified disorders of the back), and 847 (sprains and strains of other and unspecified parts). The data set included 76 chiropractic cases and 2386 medical cases. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Results The total amount paid by the insurance company was 1.7 times higher for patients treated by doctors of chiropractic (DCs) compared with those treated by medical doctors (MDs), and the cost of clinical treatment was 3.3 times higher for the DCs than MDs. Conclusion The cost for treatment by DCs was greater than that of MDs for similarly classified conditions affecting the low back. The amount paid by the insurance company was primarily related to the number of services given by each provider. "
"Objective The aims of this study were to investigate the response of the autonomic nervous system based upon the area of the spine adjusted and to determine if a cervical adjustment elicits a parasympathetic response and if a thoracic adjustment elicits a sympathetic response. Methods Forty patients (25-55 years old) met inclusion criteria that consisted of normal blood pressure, no history of heart disease, and being asymptomatic. Patients were evaluated pre– and post–chiropractic adjustment for the following autonomic responses: blood pressure and pulse rate. Seven patients were measured for heart rate variability. The subjects received either a diversified cervical segment adjustment or a diversified thoracic segment adjustment. Results Diastolic pressure (indicating a sympathetic response) dropped significantly postadjustment among those receiving cervical adjustments, accompanied by a moderate clinical effect (0.50). Pulse pressure increased significantly among those receiving cervical adjustments, accompanied by a large effect size (0.82). Although the decrease in pulse pressure for those receiving thoracic adjustments was not statistically significant, the decrease was accompanied by a moderate effect size (0.66). Conclusion It is preliminarily suggested that cervical adjustments may result in parasympathetic responses, whereas thoracic adjustments result in sympathetic responses. Furthermore, it appears that these responses may demonstrate the relationship of autonomic responses in association to the particular segment(s) adjusted. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to survey the choice of treatment provider by selected Australian office workers for common conditions that are managed in chiropractic practice. Methods Office workers of a medium-sized legal company in Sydney, Australia, were surveyed. The participants (n = 125) were asked to complete a written questionnaire on their preferred treatment choices for common physical conditions, such as back pain, neck pain, and headache. Results A total of 81 people returned completed questionnaires. Forty-two people (52%) reported that they would attend a general medical practitioner first for back pain. In comparison, 24% of people reported that they would attend a physiotherapist first for back pain. Eleven people (13%) reported that they would attend a chiropractor first for back pain. Fifty-one percent (51%) of employees reported that their preferred treatment first choice for neck pain was a general practitioner. Chiropractic was rated as third (30%) most common choice for the treatment of neck pain (equal with physiotherapy). The preferred first choice (63% of employees) for headache treatment was a general practitioner. The second most common choice for treatment of headache was a naturopath (50%). Eighty-one percent of employees ranked a general practitioner as their preferred treatment first choice for migraine, and 39% of employees also ranked the general practitioner as the second most common treatment choice for migraine. Conclusions In this sample of Australian workers, chiropractic was rated within the top 3 choices for several common neuromusculoskeletal conditions for which they may have chosen a chiropractor. Because of the small sample size and limited parameters of this study, no strong conclusions can be made until further data are collected. "
"Objective This study investigates the effect of chiropractic treatment on hip joint extension ability and running velocity. Methods This was a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental pilot study. Seventeen healthy male junior athletes (age, 17-20 years) training in middle distance running were recruited from local Swedish athletic associations. Hip extension ability and running velocity were measured before and after the study period. Chiropractic investigations comprised motion palpation of the sacroiliac and hip joints and modified Thomas test of the ability to extend the leg. In the treatment group, findings of restrictive joint dysfunctions formed the basis for the choice of chiropractic treatment. The interventions were based on a pragmatic approach consisting of high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulations targeted toward, but not exclusively to, the sacroiliac joints. Results The treatment group showed significantly greater hip extension ability after chiropractic treatment than did controls (P < .05). Participants in the treatment group did not show a significant decrease in time for running 30 m after treatment (average, −0.065 seconds; P = .0572), whereas the difference was even smaller for the control subjects (average, −0.003; P = .7344). P P P P P P Conclusions The results imply that chiropractic treatment can improve hip extensibility in subjects with restriction as measured by the modified Thomas test. It could be speculated that the running step was amplified by increasing the angle of step through facilitated hip joint extension ability. The possible effect of chiropractic treatment to enhance the running velocity, by increasing the hip joint extension ability and thereby increasing the running step, remains unproven. "
"Objective Vitamin C has been shown to be an effective therapeutic for reducing total serum cholesterol, but epidemiologic studies have determined that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are actually better predictive measures of coronary heart disease risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the effect of vitamin C supplementation on LDL and HDL cholesterol as well as triglycerides in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Methods Thirteen randomized controlled trials published between 1970 and June 2007 were identified using Medline and a manual search. From the 13 trials, 14 separate group populations with hypercholesterolemia and who were supplemented with at least 500 mg/d of vitamin C for between 3 and 24 weeks were entered into the meta-analysis. This meta-analysis used a random-effects model; and the overall effect sizes were calculated for changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol, as well as triglyceride concentrations. Results The pooled estimate of effect for vitamin C supplementation on LDL and HDL cholesterol was −7.9 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], −12.3 to −3.5; P = .000) and 1.1 mg/dL (95% CI, −0.2 to 2.3; not significant), respectively. The pooled estimate of effect for vitamin C supplementation on triglycerides was −20.1 mg/dL (95% CI, −33.3 to −6.8; P < .003). P P P P Conclusion Supplementation with at least 500 mg/d of vitamin C, for a minimum of 4 weeks, can result in a significant decrease in serum LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. However, there was a nonsignificant elevation of serum HDL cholesterol. "
"Objective This randomized controlled study was designed to determine the pain-relieving effect of Biofreeze (Performance Health Inc., Export, PA) body surface application and chiropractic adjustments on subjects with acute low back pain (LBP). Methods The data were collected at the baseline, 2 weeks after treatment, and 4 weeks after treatment for final analyses. Diversified manual adjustments were provided by licensed chiropractors twice a week for 4 weeks to both control and experimental groups. Biofreeze was applied to the lower back area 3 times a day for 4 weeks in the experimental group. Outcome assessments included visual analog scale, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, heart rate variability for stress, and electromyography for low back muscle activity. Results A total of 36 subjects were recruited in the study (25 male). The average age was 34 years. Significant pain reduction was found after each week of treatment in the experimental group (P < .05). The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire did not show significant changes in both groups. There were no significant differences for pain reduction in the control group. Heart rate variability analysis showed no significant change (P > .05) in the experimental group after 4 weeks of Biofreeze and chiropractic adjustments. There were no statistically significant changes in the electromyography readings between the 2 groups. P P P P Conclusion Biofreeze combined with chiropractic adjustment showed significant reduction in LBP. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the surface areas of 12 atlanto-occipital joints from 6 cadavers to determine how well their ipsilateral and contralateral surface areas matched. Methods Three methods were used. Method 1 consisted of digitized photographs downloaded to the Able Image Analyser software program (Ljubljana, Slovenia; http://able.mulabs.com). The perimeters were measured and expressed as square millimeters. Method 2 consisted of a point count method using moulds of the joint surfaces produced by pressing aluminum paper, leaving a clear imprint for analysis. Method 3 consisted of drawing outlines of the molds from method 2 onto transparencies and assessing overlap. http://able.mulabs.com http://able.mulabs.com Results Method 1 showed a moderate correlation of matched articular surfaces between the left C1 superior articulating surface and the left condyle (r = 0.573, P = .01). Method 2 showed moderate correlations between all surface areas that were analyzed. The matched pairs compared were left C1 superior articulating surface and left condyle (r = 0.588, P = .01) and right C1 and right condyle (r = 0.730, P = .001). The contralateral surfaces correlated were left C1 and right C1 (r = 0.596, P = .009) and right condyle and left condyle (r = 0.769, P = .000). Method 3 showed no statistically significant differences between surface areas. r P r P r P r P r P r P r P r P r P r P Conclusions All 3 methods revealed that the articular surfaces of the atlas and corresponding or contralateral condyle for specimens used in this study were not an exact match.

"Objective Vinyl chiropractic tables have been found to harbor pathogenic bacteria, but wiping with a simple disinfection agent can significantly reduce the risk of bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of microbes and other allergens or pathogens on cloth chiropractic tables. Methods Cloth-covered tables in a chiropractic college teaching clinic were selected. Samples were taken from the facial piece and hand rests with RODAC plates containing nutrient agar, followed by confirmatory testing when indicated. Results Numerous microbacteria strains were found, including Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium. Allergen-producing molds, including Candida, were also found. Staphylococcus aureus Propionibacterium Candida Staphylococcus aureus Propionibacterium Candida Conclusion Cloth tables were shown to contain pathogenic microbacteria and allergens. The chiropractic profession should establish an infection control protocol relevant to treatment tables and discard use of cloth-covered treatment tables in this process. "
"Objective The purpose of this project was to develop and test protocols for a randomized clinical trial of a combined therapeutic approach (thoracic spine and sacroiliac joint high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation [HVLA SM] + cervical spine postisometric relaxation) and cervical spine HVLA SM for patients with subacute or chronic neck pain. Methods Patients were recruited in the Quad Cities in Iowa and Illinois. After a baseline assessment visit, eligible patients were randomly assigned to cervical spine HVLA SM or to the combined therapeutic approach for 4 treatment visits over 2 weeks. Outcome assessments included the Neck Disability Index, visual analog scale, and posttreatment response questionnaire. Patient outcomes were not aggregated or compared by treatment group. Results It took approximately 8 months of planning, which included the development of forms and protocols, pretesting the forms, and training staff and clinicians in the standardized protocols. Twelve participants were screened, and 6 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to care over a 6-week period. All patients completed 5 visits. Five of 6 patients had an improvement on the Neck Disability Index. On the visual analog scale, 2 patients improved at 2 weeks, whereas the other 4 got worse. Five patients completed the posttreatment response questionnaire; 2 of the 5 indicated they experienced discomfort or an unpleasant reaction from the study treatments. Conclusions Designing a successful feasibility randomized clinical trial requires considerable planning, development and pretesting of the forms and protocols, and training clinicians and staff for standardized protocols. Patients were willing to be randomized, follow treatment protocols, complete baseline and outcome assessments, and return 83% of the follow-up questionnaires. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine if ischemic compression therapy over the bladder area results in clinically important changes among female patients with stress and mixed (stress and urge) incontinence. Methods One group of patients (n = 24) received ischemic compression therapy directed over the bladder area (experimental group). The control group (n = 9) received ischemic compression therapy directed toward structures of the hip joint. Changes in urinary incontinence symptoms were monitored using a 2-part questionnaire: the urogenital distress inventory and the incontinence impact questionnaire. Patients' perceived amelioration (improvement) was quantified using a scale divided from 0% to 100%. Results Mean scores for the first questionnaire (urogenital distress inventory + incontinence impact questionnaire, 19 questions) were 23.3 vs 25.3 at baseline and 10.2 vs 22.2 after 15 treatments for the experimental and control group, respectively. The experimental group scores were 6.9 at 30 days after the last treatment and 11.3 at the 6-month follow-up. The perceived percentages of amelioration after 15 treatments were 69% vs 32% for the experimental and control group, respectively. The experimental group scores were 73% at 30 days after the last treatment and 60% at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions In this study, ischemic compression directed toward elicited trigger points over bladder area was found to be an effective treatment of patients presenting symptoms of urinary incontinence. Improvement in symptoms was still present in follow-up at 6 months. "
"Objective The purpose of this study was to collect preliminary information on the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation on reducing risk of falls in older adults with impaired balance, as assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). This information is necessary to develop a line of investigation into the role of chiropractic care on reduction of fall risk in this population. Methods Randomized, 2-group pretest/posttest design feasibility study with a target sample size of 10 (5 per group), conducted within the outpatient health center of a chiropractic college. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 60 years or older, able to stand on one leg <5 seconds, and able to attend all sessions. Patients were assigned to chiropractic care (CMT) or supervised exercise (EX) and scheduled for 2 visits per week for 8 weeks. Results A total of 26 people responded to recruitment; and 11 were enrolled: 6 in the CMT and 5 in the EX group. Two patients dropped out at the baseline visit when they were assigned to the EX group. One CMT patient dropped out in the seventh week because of a fall at home resulting in a leg fracture. All remaining patients were compliant with treatment protocols. Five of 6 CMT patients and 4 of 5 EX patients had baseline BBS scores <45, indicating increased risk of falls. At visit 16, 2 CMT and 1 of the 3 remaining EX patients had BBS scores <45. One mild and transient adverse event was noted. Conclusion Further investigation of the possible role of chiropractic care in reducing fall risk in this population appears feasible. "
"Objective Temporomandibular disorders are a group of disorders affecting the temporomandibular joint and/or masticatory muscles. One of the signs associated with temporomandibular disorders is a reduction in mouth opening. During normal mouth opening, extension occurs at the cervical-cranial junction. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if manual therapy applied to the cervical-cranial junction would significantly improve mouth-opening capacity. Methods One hundred one participants were randomly assigned to either an Active Release Technique (ART) group; high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation (HVLA) group; or control group. A blinded investigator measured mouth opening using a TheraBite range of motion scale (TheraBite Corporation, West Chester, PA). Participants received ART to the suboccipitals or HVLA to the cervical spine at C1 or sat with an investigator for 3 minutes with no treatment. After the treatment session, mouth opening was remeasured. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the group mean values. The a priori α level was .05. α α Results The repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the ART, HVLA, and control groups' pretreatment and posttreatment measurements (F = 0.41, P > .05). P P Conclusion Manual therapy to the cervical spine did not significantly improve mouth opening in this asymptomatic population. Future trials using participants with restricted mouth-opening measures are warranted. "
"Objective This study measured the electromyographic (EMG) responses of the temporalis muscle to electrical stimulation at 10 acupuncture points (acupoints) of the face and assessed whether electrical stimulation of these acupoints may improve the rhythmic activity of the muscles that open and close the jaw. Methods Fifty healthy adults clenched 2 thin pieces of wood between their teeth and kept a constant bite force for 30 seconds. The left anterior temporalis muscle was chosen for spontaneous EMG stimulation and recording. Results The mean EMG responses were positive at 10 points in early reflexes but negative at points Jiache, Chengjiang, and Dicang for late reflexes. No statistically significant difference was observed in the responses between age and stimulation intensity for both areas, but a significant inverse correlation existed between the distance from the acupoint to the recording electrode and the response. Conclusion This study showed that the surface electrical current applied to facial skin acupoints may excite or inhibit the anterior temporalis muscle via reflex pathways. The result from this stimulation may be applied to treat temporomandibular joint disorder occlusion of muscular origin. "
"The etiology of cervical artery dissection (CAD) is unclear, although a number of risk factors have been reported to be associated with the condition. On rare occasions, patients experience CAD after cervical spine manipulation, making knowledge about the cervical arteries, the predisposing factors, and the pathogenesis of the condition of interest to chiropractors. This commentary reports on the relevant anatomy of the cervical arteries, developmental features of CAD, epidemiology of the condition, and mechanisms of dissection. The analysis of CAD risk factors is confusing, however, because many people are exposed to mechanical events and known pathophysiological associations without ever experiencing dissection. No cause-and-effect relationship has been established between cervical spine manipulation and CAD, but it seems that cervical manipulation may be capable of triggering dissection in a susceptible patient or contributing to the evolution of an already existing CAD. Despite the many risk factors that have been proposed as possible causes of CAD, it is still unknown which of them actually predispose patients to CAD after cervical spine manipulation. "
"Objective This study aimed at determining the standing spinal landmark that corresponds to the inferior tip of the scapula and determining the accuracy of experienced palpators in locating a spinous process (SP) 3 levels above and below a given SP. Methods The study participants were 34 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic chiropractic students. An experienced palpator located the inferior scapular tip on each and then positioned a 2-mm lead marker about 5 cm lateral to the nearest SP. Two more markers were placed at levels intended to be 3 levels above and below the first marker placed. The locations of the scapular tip and the spinal targets were determined by comparison with a radiological criterion standard. Results The standing inferior scapular tip corresponded to the T8 SP on average (SD = 0.9). Having placed the first lead marker, examiners on average overshot the upper marker by 0.26 (SD = 0.51) vertebral levels and undershot the lower marker by 0.21 (SD = 0.48) vertebral levels. The modes for the placement of the 3 markers were at T5, T8, and T11. Conclusion Approximately 68% of patients would be palpated to have their inferior scapular tips at T7, T8, or T9. An experienced palpator can quite accurately locate vertebral levels 3 above or below a given landmark. Chiropractors and other health professionals using the typical rule of thumb linking the inferior scapular tip to the standing T7 SP have likely been applying clinical interventions at spinal locations different from those intended. "
"Objective There is controversy as to whether increased doctor-patient ratios result in a commensurate benefit to the health care consumer. This study assesses doctor (allopathic/osteopathic physician and chiropractor) ratios in the 50 states in the United States and correlates these ratios with various health outcomes to determine if one doctor type has stronger correlations in certain outcomes compared with the other doctor type by geographic region. Methods A total of 21 health outcomes for the year 2004, such as obesity and cancer deaths, were correlated with 2004 physician and chiropractor ratios (number of doctors per 100 000 population). The 25 highest doctor ratio states, along with the corresponding health outcomes, were compared with the 25 lowest doctor ratio states and the corresponding health outcomes. The Spearman and Wilcoxon tests (for correlation and differences, respectively) were used to assess the data. Results Increases in doctor ratios resulted in correlations in 12 outcomes for chiropractors and 8 outcomes for allopathic/osteopathic physicians. When comparing low with high doctor ratios, physicians had improvements in 13 outcomes, whereas chiropractors had 12. Conclusions Correlation does not necessarily show causation but may provide clues. Many of the improved outcomes were not surprising for allopathic/osteopathic physicians, for example, cardiovascular deaths, but were surprising for chiropractors. It is possible, although care should be taken to avoid overspeculation, that doctors of chiropractic are having an effect in seemingly unlikely outcomes such as cardiovascular and cancer deaths. Further research is warranted for other years to verify these findings. "
"Objective The objective of this review is to determine how frequently likelihood ratios (LRs) have been used or described in the chiropractic literature and to depict their appropriate use in the clinical setting. Methods A literature search was conducted of the MEDLINE, Manual Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System, and Index to Chiropractic Literature databases, with search years encompassing 1966 through June 2006. Citations in the English language that addressed the following search terms were retrieved: likelihood ratio in combination with manipulation and chiropractic. likelihood ratio manipulation chiropractic likelihood ratio manipulation chiropractic Results The searches netted a total of 64 citations: 10 in MEDLINE, 34 in the Manual Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System, and 20 in the Index to Chiropractic Literature. After eliminating articles from journals that were not focused specifically on chiropractic, duplicates, and those that did not involve LRs, 3 articles remained and were reviewed. None of the reviewed articles provided a description of LRs, and only 2 used them in a clinical context. Conclusions The use of LRs can be very helpful in patient management; however, LRs are rarely reported in the chiropractic literature. Accordingly, chiropractic practitioners are most likely uninformed on the subject and may not have the capacity to use them in formulating diagnoses. It is suggested that researchers increase the reporting of LRs and that chiropractic clinicians begin to make use of them in day-to-day practice. "
"Objective The use of triage in a chiropractic practice is to determine whether or not a patient who has presented to an office is in need of a referral to another health care provider. The objective of this article is to illustrate the use of triage skills in a primary care, chiropractic pediatric practice. This is examined both in the new patient setting and during visit-to-visit protocol. Method An analysis of the number of chiropractic triage visits during a 1-year period was performed on 48 new children or pregnant women and 1634 existing pediatric and pregnancy visits. Results The average level of chiropractic triage for a new patient, whether pediatric or pregnant, was a limited level of concern (P3, green flag), with more than 85% of new patients falling into that category. Fifteen percent were at a cautionary (P2, yellow flag) level, and none were at the emergency (P1, red flag) level. Between 12% and 15% of the total of existing pediatric or pregnancy visits were at a P1 or P2 level of triage, and 11% of the total of pediatric triage visits were at the P1 level. Conclusion New patients rarely come to a chiropractic pediatric office in a P1-level crisis, whereas existing patients have a much higher likelihood of presenting during a P1 challenge. P2 triage levels are somewhat common, whereas P3 triage levels are the most frequent. Triage methods are a way to help place a patient in a category that can ensure an optimum, safe, and effective level of care. "
Objective The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the topic of chiropractic care during pregnancy. Methods A PubMed search was performed using the terms pregnancy and chiropractic. Sources were cross-referenced to obtain further articles and research information after reviewing the articles obtained through the search. pregnancy chiropractic pregnancy chiropractic Results Thirty-three references were used for this review. The current literature reports favorable results on the use of chiropractic care throughout pregnancy. Conclusions Chiropractic evaluation and treatment during pregnancy may be considered a safe and effective means of treating common musculoskeletal symptoms that affect pregnant patients. The scarcity of published literature warrants further research. 
"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the validity of the sacral base pressure test in diagnosing sacroiliac joint dysfunction. It also determined the predictive powers of the test in determining which type of sacroiliac joint dysfunction was present. Methods This was a double-blind experimental study with 62 participants. The results from the sacral base pressure test were compared against a cluster of previously validated tests of sacroiliac joint dysfunction to determine its validity and predictive powers. The external rotation of the feet, occurring during the sacral base pressure test, was measured using a digital inclinometer. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the results of the sacral base pressure test between the types of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. In terms of the results of validity, the sacral base pressure test was useful in identifying positive values of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. It was fairly helpful in correctly diagnosing patients with negative test results; however, it had only a “slight” agreement with the diagnosis for κ interpretation. κ κ Conclusions In this study, the sacral base pressure test was not a valid test for determining the presence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction or the type of dysfunction present. Further research comparing the agreement of the sacral base pressure test or other sacroiliac joint dysfunction tests with a criterion standard of diagnosis is necessary. "
"Objective The objective of this study is to use randomized controlled research design to investigate the effect of an exercise program and custom-made flexible orthotics on heart rate variability and blood pressure at varying stages of exercise over a 5-month period. Methods Thirteen ping-pong players were recruited and randomly assigned into control and experimental groups. Both groups had the same exercise program, and only the experimental group wore custom-made flexible orthotics. Exercise effects were compared before and after the training using heart rate variability and blood pressure. The study lasted 5 months with 1 data collection per month except in the fourth month. Results Ten male players (6 in the experimental group) completed the study. The average age of the participants was 44 ± 16 years. The blood pressure in the experimental group significantly decreased after the 5-month study period and after each exercise session. The blood pressure did not change significantly after each exercise session in the control group. The heart rate was significantly increased immediately after exercise and remained at a higher level after the 20 minutes of rest at the end of each day's exercise session. The average resting heart rate decreased from 69.7 ± 1.708 to 66.8 ± 4.480 (P < .05) in the experimental group but increased from 69.7 ± 1.708 to 90.7 ± 2.808 (P > .05) in the control group. The total power reflecting the total autonomic activity was significantly decreased immediately after exercise and after the 20-minute rest period at the end of the exercise session in both the control and experimental groups. P P P P Conclusions There were positive changes in cardiac and vascular autonomic regulations with exercise training when combined with foot orthotics. "
"Objective The temperature of the mastoid fossa region has been measured by chiropractors since the 1950s using various instruments. The reliability of the procedure is largely unknown for the various instruments used for this purpose. This study assessed the reliability of a thermal instrument designed to measure forehead temperature while having an alternate landmark as the mastoid fossa. Methods: Thirty students were recruited to participate. Three blinded examiners twice scanned each student with the temporal artery thermometer. Intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Differential margins of error were also calculated. Results Intraexaminer reliability was acceptable in 6 of 6 assessments, whereas interexaminer reliability was acceptable in 3 of 4 assessments. The maximum mean differential margin of error was 0.54 for intraexaminer reliability and 0.46 for interexaminer reliability. Discussion Combining the mean maximum differential margin of error for intraexaminer (0.54°) and interexaminer (0.46°) and then averaging these 2 ([0.54 + 0.46] / 2) results in a maximum mean differential margin of error of 0.50°. Conclusion In this study, intraexaminer reliability ranged from fair to strong. For these examiners, fossa differentials of 0.5 can be considered within the margin of error. "
"Objective The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the quality of nutritional counseling that the chiropractic patient receives, for what conditions, and the need to establish easy-to-use protocols for nutritional counseling. Methods Chiropractors practicing in the state of New York were surveyed and were asked if they valued the use of nutritional counseling, if they used it, if they charged for it, what are the barriers for not doing more of it, and what types of counseling they put into practice. Information regarding what types of conditions the chiropractors treated with nutritional counseling and the level of interest they had in furthering their education in the field of nutrition was also collected. There was no statistical validation of the survey, but demographics were included to determine if the sample was representative of practicing chiropractors. Results Eighty percent of the respondents used some form of counseling in their practices but desired to have more knowledge in the area of clinical nutrition. Most preferred online courses to obtain this knowledge. Chiropractors treated a variety of chronic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system. Conclusion With 80% of the doctors who participated in the survey reporting they incorporate some form of nutritional counseling into their practices, it is suggested that the chiropractic physician is interested in a holistic practice. The next step is a comprehensive survey to determine the needs of chiropractors in the United States, so standardized protocols can be created that suit the needs of practitioners nationwide. "
"Objective This study describes the playing characteristics of golfers who had an injury to their lower back in the course of play or practice in the previous year (12 months). Methods A retrospective survey was mailed to members of randomly selected golf clubs across Australia. Statistical methods used included 2-sample t test to compare means of 2 independent populations and the χ2 test to examine the association between categorical variables/factors in the study. t χ 2 t χ 2 Results Of 1634 Australian amateur golfers surveyed, 17.6% of golfers sustained at least 1 injury in the previous year. The lower back accounted for 25% of all golf-related injuries in the previous year, making the lower back the most common site of injury. The golfer with a golf-related lower back injury was likely to have a previous history of lower back injury, while the injury had a progressive onset compared with an acute single onset. The follow-through phase of the golf swing was reported to be associated with the greatest likelihood of injury compared with other phases of the swing. Most of the injured golfers received treatment of their injury with a general practitioner (69%), a physiotherapist (49%), or a chiropractor (40%). Conclusion Practitioners treating golfers with a history of lower back injury should evaluate the golf swing follow-through to identify potential causes of aggravation to the lower back. Targeted measures such as spinal manipulative therapy, soft tissue and back exercise, and conditioning programs to assist the strength and mobility of the golfer could then be implemented. "
"Objective Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of lost work time and has been recognized as America's number one workplace safety challenge. Low back pain is occurring at epidemic proportions among construction workers, and minority populations have been underinvestigated for risk of back injury. This project investigated the multiple potential risk factors for occupational LBP among Hispanic residential carpenters. Methods This investigation evaluated 241 Hispanic residential framing carpenters. Data for this study were collected using a 91-question survey. End points of interest included point, annual, and lifetime prevalence of LBP. Results Nineteen percent of respondents reported they had an episode of LBP in their lifetime. Conclusions Hispanic residential carpenters reported less than expected prevalence of LBP compared with non-Hispanic counterparts in the same trade and location. Job tasks and personal and workplace risk factors, including psychological and morphological characteristics, affect the prevalence of LBP among Hispanic framing carpenters. "
"Objectives This study examines (a) the feasibility of continued research with an older population; (b) the variety of hand-wrist conditions presented by older patients; (c) the accommodations to standard chiropractic treatment for older patients; and (d) the validity, reliability, responsiveness of measures, and preliminary estimates of outcome of treatment for general hand-wrist pain. a b c d a b c d Methods A cohort of 55 volunteers, first evaluated over a 5-week natural-history baseline period, was offered 5-week chiropractic treatment and then interviewed at 6 months posttreatment. Descriptive and preliminary inferential analyses are reported. Start values for power analysis are offered. Results The project recruited a sample of 55 and retained 47 (85%) participants over 8 months, indicating feasibility of a larger project. Participants provided strong self-reported, albeit preliminary, evidence of benefit. Mean values and SDs of pain and strength measures are provided for future power calculations. Conclusions Clinical research with older participants presenting with hand-wrist pain and dysfunction is feasible. Validity, reliability, and responsiveness of self-reports are demonstrated. The research presents preliminary evidence of the benefit of chiropractic treatment for older patients presenting with hand-wrist symptoms. "
"Objective This pilot project investigates the effectiveness of the Toftness system of chiropractic adjusting on subjects with pain syndromes. Methods Patients were recruited from 13 doctors' offices. All subjects received Toftness chiropractic adjustments. The visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry low back pain questionnaire were used for all subjects before and after chiropractic adjustments. Results A total of 42 patients were recruited. Twenty-eight patients had acute or chronic back pain and 14 experienced other types of pain (eg, neck pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, etc). The average age of the patient population (18 male, 24 female) was 53 ± 16 years. After 6 to 8 weeks of chiropractic adjustments, pain as analyzed using the visual analog scale was reduced significantly from 73.6 ± 12.790 to 17.0 ± 13.363 (P < .001). The Oswestry score decreased significantly from 69.3 ± 18.525 to 12.4 ± 10.504 (P < .001). There were no adverse treatment effects reported by the participating patients. P P P P Conclusion The Toftness system of chiropractic adjusting reduced low back and other pain syndromes in the subjects studied. It suggests that the Toftness system of chiropractic adjusting was safe and effective to use in low back pain and other pain-related conditions. "
"Objective It has been theorized that low back pain contributes to the development of negative cognition (negative thinking) which may predispose a person towards chronicity. The objective of this paper is to examine the role of negative cognition in non-depressed participants who have previously experienced low back pain. Methods Ten students enrolled in a course at the University of Kansas were involved in a 4 week educational project. The participants completed self-rated assessments of depression using the 21 item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-21) and the visual analogue pain scale (VAS). The study was broken into 3 phases over 4 weeks. Phase 1 focused on the VAS and the BDI-21 along with questions pertaining to low back pain. Phase 2 included 2 questions with 1 of the questions focusing on common negative distortions. Phase 3 focused on 11 clinical-type questions relating to awareness of negative thinking and chronic low back pain. Results Phase 1 showed that 7 of the students had a history of chronic low back pain while 8 students believed they had negative thoughts when low back pain occurred. Conversely, only 1 student had experienced negative thoughts prior to a low back pain episode. The initial BDI-21 scores demonstrated a mean score of 5.5 with a mean VAS of 5.75. After students were exposed to the idea that they may have negative cognition processes (phase 2), 4 students indicated that they noticed themselves thinking negatively and attempted to alter such processes. Phase 3 results indicated that 4 of the students did attempt to change negative thinking after being made aware that negative thinking could be present. Conclusion The results of this study showed that a majority of participants believed that a person's negative thoughts can impair a person toward activity yet none of the participants believed that such had occurred to them. Further research in the area of negative cognition and chronic low back pain is needed. "
Objective To examine changes in electromyography (EMG) and a valid self-administered outcome measure after applying active release technique to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients. Methods Five subjects (mean age 48.2 SD ± 16.7) with CTS were included in the trial. Subjects completed the Boston Questionnaire (BQ) and an EMG examination before the first treatment. Participants were treated with Active Release technique using a protocol intended to affect the median nerve 3 times a week for 2 weeks. The BQ was re-administered following the final treatment. The mean scores for the initial and final BQ were compared using a paired samples t-test. An analysis of variance compared the mean contraction amplitudes for EMG parameters before and after the first treatment. Results There was significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the mean symptom severity and functional status scores of the BQ following the intervention. There were no significant differences found in the EMG analyses. Conclusion The preliminary data from this clinical pilot trial suggest that active release technique may be an effective conservative management strategy for CTS patients. These results support the need for further clinical trials with larger samples. 
"Introduction Some practitioners believe mechanical low back pain may be caused or aggravated by a stiff ankle, stiff great toe or flat feet. This study investigates subjects with and without mechanical low back pain and measures ankle and great toe range of motion and flattening of the medial longitudinal arch in both groups. Methods The study was a blinded, 2-arm, non- randomized clinical study involving 100 subjects with chronic or recurrent mechanical low back pain (intervention group) and 104 subjects without chronic mechanical low back pain (control group) between the ages of 18 and 45. A blind assessor performed weight-bearing goniometry of the ankle and big toe and the navicular drop test on all subjects in both groups. Results An independent t-test (inter-group) revealed a statistically significant decrease (p ≤ 0.05) in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in individuals with chronic mechanical low back pain. The independent t-test suggested individuals with chronic mechanical low back pain have a significantly smaller navicular drop and higher arches (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study supports previous reports suggesting decreased ankle dorsiflexion may be a factor in chronic mechanical low-back pain. Further research and replication of this study is necessary before firm conclusions or recommendations can be made. "

"Purpose To compare personal and new bedding systems between subjects with reported high and low base line sleep quality. Methods A convenience sample of healthy subjects (women = 30; men = 29) with no clinical history of disturbed sleep participated in the study. Subjects recorded perceived back discomfort and stiffness, sleep quality and comfort, and sleep efficiency upon waking for 28 consecutive days in their own beds (baseline) and for 28 consecutive days (post) on a new bedding system. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to treat sleep data. Results Analysis revealed significant differences between pre- and post means in all areas for both high and low sleep quality groups. Analysis of sleep efficiency also yielded significant differences between, but not among pre- and post means. Improvement of sleep comfort and quality became more prominent with time (from wk 1 to 4 post observation). Conclusions Similar significant benefits of new, medium- firm bedding systems can occur for those reporting both good and poor current sleep quality and variables such as age, weight, height, and body mass index are independent of such improvements. "
"Objective To determine if there is a greater yield of pathological findings identified on MRI scans of patients referred by chiropractors as compared to those referred by allopathic providers. Methods MRI reports authored by medical radiologists from two independent MRI centers in the Denver metropolitan area were analyzed retrospectively for pathological data related to the spinal regions studied. A pathological report data sheet was used to record pathological findings in 22 different categories. A total of 150 reports from each provider group were reviewed. Results Of the 22 pathological conditions studied, a statistically significant difference between doctor of chiropractic and medical doctor referrers was identified in 4 categories: central spinal canal stenosis, lateral stenosis, facet arthrosis, and negative report. The most common primary diagnoses given for MRI referral were low back pain/sciatica, neck pain, and extremity pain. Seventy-four percent of the reports evaluated were performed on patients referred with a diagnosis of pain. In 3 of the 22 categories (14%), the medical doctors had a statistically higher pathological yield than the chiropractors. However, in 4 of the 22 categories (18%), the chiropractors had a statistically higher pathological yield. In 18 of the 22 categories (82%), there was no statistical difference between the two provider groups. Conclusion The data presented in this study suggests chiropractic and medical providers are compeer at ordering MRI for suspected pathological findings. "
"Objective This report presents a spinal adjustment approach to treat elderly patients with urinary incontinence. Methods This retrospective case series reports the clinical observation of 13 patients with urinary incontinence. They were treated for 1–8 weeks with Pro-Adjuster technique without any other additional drug and physical therapy treatment. The primary outcome measure for this analysis was the frequency of nocturia reported by the patients during each office visit to the chiropractor. Bladder control was reported by the patients as frequency of nocturia or the urgency of urination or instances of leakage, and the number of pad changes per day or a return of the sense of urinary urge. Results A total of 13 patients' data (6 female, mean ages 65.7 ± 12.9 years) were included in the study. After 1–8 weeks of chiropractic adjustments, the urinary frequency at night was significantly reduced from 3.8 to 1.2 time a night (P < 0.001). Three patients improved bladder control with only 2 adjustments. Conclusion The Pro-adjuster treatment program seemed to reduce nocturia in patients with urinary incontinence. "
"Objective To present a case of a pregnant patient with meralgia paresthetica who improved using manual therapy and exercise procedures. Clinical Features A 22-year-old patient in the sixteenth week of pregnancy had low back pain, bilateral anterolateral thigh paresthesia and groin pain for a duration of 1 month. She had no motor deficits in either lower extremity and her reflexes were intact. As a standard clinic procedure, a battery of functional tests were performed including: active straight leg raise, long dorsal ligament test, and the pelvic pain provocation procedure. Based on her clinical history and physical responses to the aforementioned functional tests, the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica was deduced. Intervention and Outcome Treatment was provided at 6 visits over a 6-week period where the patient underwent evaluation, manual intervention, and exercise prescription. Active Release Technique (ART) was performed to the restricted right sacroiliac (SIJ) complex and quadratus lumborum muscles. ART and post-isometric relaxation were applied to the illiopsoas muscles. The home exercise program consisted of pelvic/low back mobility, stabilization and relaxation exercises. After 6 treatments, the patient reported complete resolution of low back pain and left lower extremity symptoms and a 90% improvement in the right thigh symptoms. At her one-year follow-up, the patient reported no further complications and the absence of pain. Conclusions Manual therapy and exercises may serve as an effective treatment protocol for pregnant patients experiencing low back pain complicated by paresthesia. Because these conservative procedures offer a low-risk intervention, additional clinical studies are warranted to further study this treatment. "
"Objective To present a case of medial epicondylitis in an adolescent baseball pitcher that appeared to improve when addressing the upper extremity kinetic chain with a variety of conservative management strategies. Clinical Features An 18-year-old right hand dominant high school baseball pitcher had recurring sharp pain in his right elbow. Previous trials of medication and physical therapy were only partially successful in resolving the problem. The patient's pain was rated as an 8 on a numerical pain scale during throwing activities. A variety of tender points were noted in the right upper extremity. The patient had discontinued playing competitive baseball due to the pain. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated 14 times over 15 weeks. Treatment included cervical, thoracic and upper extremity manipulation, soft tissue mobilization and progressive sport-specific training for the upper extremity. After the first treatment he was able to throw the ball and was able to continue throwing during the treatment program. The patient returned to league play after the treatment program. Conclusion A course of conservative care addressing multiple elements of the upper extremity kinetic chain seemed beneficial for this athlete. "
"Objective To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a ‘best-evidence synthesis’ approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods. "
"Objective To study the effects of a nutritional supplement on cardiovascular health determined by blood and saliva biochemistry and heart rate variability (HRV) in asymptomatic college students and faculty members. Methods Forty subjects were recruited in the study via a school wide email notification and through personal contacts. GreensFirst vegetable supplement drink was tested to document its effect on the blood and saliva biochemistry in relation to cardiovascular health. Results After taking the supplement for 90 days, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly. The heart rate decreased but did not reach statistical significance. Time domain analysis of HRV showed a slight decrease in standard deviation of normal-normal and square root of the mean squared differences but did not reach statistical significance. Frequency analysis of HRV found no significant changes. Saliva dehydroepiandosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and Cortisol decreased after taking the supplement, however, they did not reach significant levels. Blood glucose concentration was increased slightly but the change was not significant. Blood serum tests showed no significant changes in the total cholesterol or the low-density lipoprotein levels. However, it was noted that the high-density lipoprotein level was decreased significantly. Triglycerides did not show any significant changes but it were slightly elevated after the treatment period. Homocysteine increased significantly after taking the supplement for 90 days. Conclusion For this group of subjects, taking the green vegetable drink for 90 days reduced blood pressure but did not significantly affect the blood and saliva chemistry. "
Objective To discuss the care of a patient with congenital torticollis who was treated with chiropractic diversified technique and a chiropractic technique proposed by Frogley and Wallace in a previously published article. Clinical Features A 6-year-old female suffered from congenital torticollis with a left head-tilt subsequent to a difficult birth that culminated in a Caesarian section. Computerized tomography of the brain revealed plagiocephaly. Left facial asymmetry was demonstrated on visual observation. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated with a chiropractic adjusting protocol as suggested by Frogley and Wallace and by diversified chiropractic technique. She tolerated the care well and experienced substantial changes in clinical presentation including a distinct improvement in head-tilt. The improvement in head-tilt has been maintained for a period of 1 year. Conclusion The conservative chiropractic methodology postulated by Frogley and Wallace in the care of headache patients should be investigated further in its use for congenial torticollis. The positive results observed with this patient lead the authors to recommend that additional studies be undertaken to assess whether these clinical observations can be replicated in other cases of congenital torticollis. 
"Objective Hypertension is a common condition with high mortality from associated diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a dietary deficiency of vitamin C may be a risk factor for hypertension. However the literature on vitamin C interventional trials appears divided on the efficacy of vitamin C utilization clinically. Methods A literature search and review of published trials using vitamin C in treating patients with hypertension was undertaken. Relevant references were located using MEDLINE (1966–2005) and the bibliographies of located articles. Results Thirteen trials making up 14 separate groups were identified and analyzed providing a pooled population of 284 hypertensive patients (52% female), with a weighted mean age of 58.8 ± 9.5 years. Median vitamin C dose and study intervention duration was 500mg/day and 6 weeks respectively. The weighted mean baseline and post treatment systolic blood pressures across all 14 groups were 149.6 ± 11.1 and 145.7 ± 11.0 mmHg respectively. This represented a systolic blood pressure decrease of 3.9 mmHg. Seven of the 14 groups ascertained statistically significant reductions (p < .05) in systolic blood pressures. However only 2 of the 14 groups found significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure. The weighted mean baseline and post treatment diastolic blood pressures across all 14 groups were 84.6 ± 4.4 and 82.5 ± 4.1 mmHg respectively. This represented a diastolic blood pressure decrease of 2.1 mmHg. Conclusion Vitamin C supplementation in hypertensive patients appears to possess modest effects on reducing systolic blood and diastolic blood pressure. "
"Objective This paper describes how and why to write a case report for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Methods PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Index to Chiropractic Literature were searched from 2000 through September 2006 using the following search terms: case report, authorship, peer review, and manuscript. Relevant manuscripts were retrieved and the results were used to update a previous narrative overview of the literature. Discussion Commensurate with the increased use of evidence-based health care and recent changes in publication requirements, new standards are expected of case reports. Case reports should present new information to the literature and be written succinctly. The types of case reports available are discussed. Steps for preparing a case report are described based upon the current available literature. Conclusion Case reports are important contributions to the health sciences literature. Proper preparation of this study design is necessary in order for it to be published. A self-evaluation check sheet for authors is included to assist in the writing process. "
"Objective The purpose of this single subject case study is to examine the relationship between cervical spine manipulation and tender points located in the upper quarter. Clinical Features A 45-year-old female presented with cervical spine pain and corresponding pain points in the upper quarter following a motor vehicle collision occurring 7 months prior to testing. Inclusion criteria were 22 of 22 clinically significant pain points as measured by pressure algometry. Intervention and Outcome High velocity/low amplitude manual manipulation was administered to areas of joint restriction in the cervical spine. Pre- and post-treatment computerized algometry readings were taken in areas of the cervical spine and upper extremities to assess change in pain over time. Algometry points were chosen based on published upper quarter tender points associated with cervical joint fixation/immobilization. Conclusion Following a series of 15 cervical chiropractic manipulations, the patient demonstrated a significant increase in pain tolerance related to upper quarter pain points and demonstrated by pressure algometry. These findings correlate well with the literature, indicating that cervical spine joint dysfunction should be considered globally as part of a dynamic kinetic chain involving the upper quarter. Dysfunction in one part of the kinetic chain should direct treatment to other areas of the chain. "
"Objective Observational studies in humans have shown an inverse relationship between plasma vitamin C concentration and total serum cholesterol. However, experimental studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the ability of vitamin C to reduce total serum cholesterol. Methods Published reports of trials studying the effects of vitamin C on serum lipids were identified by a search of Medline from 1966 to 2004. Data from 51 experimental studies comprising of 1666 pooled subjects were selected for analysis. Results A very strong negative association was observed between baseline total serum cholesterol and the percent change in cholesterol (r = −0.585, p<0.001). When subjects were divided into 4 groups based on their baseline total serum cholesterol levels, the following weighted mean percent changes in cholesterol from baseline were observed: normal cholesterol (<199mg/dl): 0.91±6.8% (n=508); borderline high cholesterol (200–239mg/dl): 3.90±5.78% (n=605); high cholesterol (240–279mg/dl): 11.40±7.96% (n=300); severe cholesterol (>280mg/dl): 14.30±8.36% (n=253). A significant inverse relationship was found between the baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations and mean percent change in total cholesterol from baseline (r = −0.500, p<0.005). It was also observed that the high and severe baseline cholesterol groups possessed lower baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations than those in the normal cholesterol groups (0.79 and 0.55 versus 1.24 mg/dl respectively). Conclusion This finding strengthens the hypothesis that the cholesterol lowering and cardio-protective benefit of vitamin C supplementation may be in its ability to elevate plasma vitamin C concentrations in those patients who initially possess lower than normal vitamin C plasma concentrations. "
"Objective To review commonly encountered calcifications found within the abdomen as seen on the lumbar spine radiograph and to determine which advanced imaging modality is best to thoroughly assess the patient. Methods Searches of electronic databases and textbooks were conducted to construct this narrative overview. Discussion By categorizing the type of calcification and localizing it anatomically, most often a definitive diagnosis can be reached. Two commonly encountered conditions, abdominal aortic aneurysms and urinary calculi, are used to compare the main advanced imaging modalities (diagnostic ultrasound and computed tomography) used to further assess abdominal calcifications. Conclusion In most circumstances, either diagnostic ultrasound or computed tomography will establish a definitive diagnosis and offer thorough imaging assessment for abdominal calcifications. "
"Purpose Exercise therapy has become an expected modality in the treatment of low back pain but there are no clear evidence based guidelines available. The purpose of this review is to analyze the available literature in regard to demonstrated efficacy of various types of exercise therapy for low back pain. Method A search was made on PubMed for exercise and low back pain that found 28 citations in English including 23 randomized controlled clinical trials published between 1993 and 2004 and 5 literature reviews published in 2000 through 2002. Results Previous reviews have stated that the literature does not support the use of exercise therapy for acute low back pain but it does give qualified support to exercise therapy for chronic low back pain. More recent studies have divided subjects based on functional rather than temporal characteristics, specifically, taking into consideration the directional preference of the patient and addressing muscle groups that augment stabilization of the “neutral zone.” Such approaches yield effective clinical response in both acute and chronic patients within 2 weeks with 6 visits and provide lasting benefit up to 3 years after intervention. Conclusions By identifying specific functional characteristics of individual patients, providers should be able to design exercise therapies that will provide more effective clinical intervention for low back pain patients.

"Background The female menstrual cycle is a complicated interaction of hormonal messages that are under the control of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian axis. Dysfunction in this axis can lead to anovulation and infertility. Stress has the potential to produce such dysfunction. Objectives To review the normal menstrual cycle, and present a number of case studies on how the stress- reducing technique of Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) successfully aided the fertility of a number of female patients by resolving anovulation/menstrual irregularity. Methods Three chronic anovulating, infertile patients underwent NET. A visual analog scale was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Outcomes Anovulating patients started to ovulate following a series of treatments. Initial visual analog scale (VAS) scale on menstrual irregularity was rated 10 out of a possible 10 (anovulation) for all patients. After treatment, these 3 patients rated 0 out of 10 on the VAS scale and had fallen pregnant with subsequent birthing. A discussion of the potential link between stress and anovulation through altered gonadotropin releasing hormone pulsitile activity and how the use of NET may have resolved the anovulation seen in these 3 patients is presented. Conclusion The success attributed to the NET intervention and the resumption of ovulation warrant the need for further research involving long term prospective randomized controlled trial experiments to determine a direct causal relationship. "
"Background Health Promotion may involve assessing the community and assisting in the formation of coalitions that empower a community to reduce health risks. Objective To describe an intervention lead by a doctor of chiropractic to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in one rural southeast Alabama town. Discussion A coalition influenced the city council to modify an existing ordinance governing smoking in public places. As a secondary goal, the coalition hoped to use the local media to significantly increase public awareness of the dangers of ETS through positive press coverage of their efforts and general media advocacy. City councilmen and the local media were involved in the coalition to use a political process to change the ordinance. Ten months after initiating the project, the existing ordinance was modified. Conclusion Doctors of chiropractic involved as health advocates were able to change the local ordinance pertaining to indoor smoking. "
"Objective To present an overview of symptomatic motion sickness disorder and to propose allopathic and chiropractic approaches for treatment. Clinical Features Three representative cases are presented involving patients with motion sickness. All 3 patients had suffered from this condition throughout their lives. A discussion of the hypothesis of sensory conflict as a causative factor in cases of motion sickness is offered. Intervention and Outcome Following methods founded in applied kinesiology and using spinal and cranial manipulative treatment, the patients were able to travel long distances without nausea, sickness, or dizziness. The evaluation of these patients' responses to treatment was determined by the doctor's observation, the patients' subjective description of symptoms while riding in a motor vehicle, a visual analog scale for neck and associated pain, and applied kinesiology chiropractic physical assessment tools. Conclusion Further studies into chiropractic manipulative treatments for sensory conflict and proprioceptive dysfunctions associated with the problem of motion sickness are indicated. The hypothesis of sensory conflict as the cause of motion sickness should be explored more fully by other chiropractic physicians and researchers. "
"Objective The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate how focused encouragement and support helps ensure a patient's compliance to home protocols and recommended treatment plans with positive outcomes. Clinical Features The patient was experiencing chronic low back pain complicated by diffuse annular bulging of a lumbar disc with radicular left leg pain and foot numbing. The numeric pain scale, positive orthopedic and neurological tests, and the length of time the patient had a chronic low back condition helped to determine when she could start rehabilitation exercises. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated using chiropractic adjustments and active and passive rehabilitation. As the pain scale value decreased and orthopedic tests became negative, more challenging spinal stabilization protocols were introduced. Conclusion A patient with a chronic condition may need extra encouragement along with positive support for a positive outcome to chiropractic care. The need for cooperation from the patient can often be overlooked in treating a chronic condition. Chiropractors should take extra steps to focus on the patient's compliance with the recommended treatment plan and home protocols. "
"Objectives To explicate the relationships among the definitions and practices of chiropractic, wellness and public health and to make recommendations for strengthening these relationships. Background Public health-related topics comprise less than 2% of chiropractic coursework at most chiropractic colleges, and few connections currently exist between chiropractic and public health practice. The concept of well-ness is common to both, and might serve to bridge the gap between the individual health services provided by chiropractors and the community health services provided by public health agencies. Conclusion It is time for chiropractic to join the public health movement to improve the health and promote wellness not just in their patient populations, but in their communities, and demonstrate their commitment to patient wellness by integrating their efforts with the healthcare mainstream. "
"Objective To review current literature regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and conservative treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis. Methods The PubMed database was searched for articles on spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis and their incidence, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, and prognosis. The bibliographies of articles determined to be relevant were also reviewed. Results A PubMed search of spondylolysis or spondylolis-thesis yielded over 800 citations. Sixty-eight articles were selected based on an opinion of perceived relevance to the subjects of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. Conclusions Spondylolysis affects approximately 6% of the population. The lesion likely represents a stress fracture and the typical age of onset is early childhood and adolescence. Most individuals are asymptomatic. Adolescents with low back pain may have an impending or new pars defect. A high index of suspicion for a new pars defect should prompt utilization of physiologic imaging to determine the likelihood of pars union in young patients. Restrictive bracing may lead to healing of the fracture and cessation of pain. Spondylolisthesis is a common complication of spondylolysis. Spondylolisthesis progression is typically small and most likely in young individuals. Significant progression in adults is rare. The finding of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in an adult patient is usually incidental and not likely to be a direct source of pain unless there is concurrent instability. "
"Objective To describe the management of groin pain occurring during pregnancy using a comprehensive conservative approach. Clinical Features A 32-year-old woman 20 weeks into her pregnancy experienced difficulty standing and moving due to groin pain. She also had pain with forward bending and a positive long dorsal ligament test. She had a Quebec Task and Force Disability Scale questionnaire score of 122 and rated her pain as an 8/10 on a visual analog scale. Intervention and Outcome Active Release Technique, home relaxation exercises, patient education, and ergo-nomic training were provided over approximately 3 weeks (3 treatments). Her Quebec score was 62 and she had no pain after treatment. Conclusion A comprehensive treatment plan of soft tissue release, patient education and home exercises appeared to help minimize this patient's groin pain associated with pregnancy. "
"Objective Establishing objective descriptive data regarding manual muscle testing (MMT) as used in Applied Kinesiology, including “patient-started” versus “examiner- started” variations, is necessary before research pertaining to the reliability and clinical significance of this procedure is done. This study measured surface electromyography (sEMG) output from experienced MMT practitioners and their tested subjects during the performance of sequential MMT on the same muscle during 3 styles of MMT: normally-done, examiner-started and patient-started. Methods 21 examiners experienced in MMT and 24 subjects with varying degrees of exposure to MMT were engaged in the study. sEMG was simultaneously recorded from examiner and subject during testing of the middle deltoid muscle. The examiner first tested the middle deltoid muscle of the subject in his/her normal fashion 3 times and identified the MMT style as “examiner-started” or “patient-started.” He/she was then asked to perform the other method of MMT. If the examiner said he/she did not know or did not differentiate which form of testing was initially done, he/she then performed one series each of examiner- and patient started MMT. Results Nine (approximately 43 %) of testers identified their “normally done” muscle test as examiner-started, 4 (19%) as patient-started and 8 (38%) as simultaneous or undifferentiated. In 64.5% of the MMT described as examiner started, sEMG showed that the examiner's contraction started before the patient's. In tests identified as patient started, 54% were indeed patient started. Undifferentiated tests were 45% patient-started, 45% examiner started and 10% exactly simultaneous. Near simultaneous contractions were observed in 55% of all tracings evaluated and 70% of undifferentiated tests. Conclusions While many MMT practitioners consider that they are performing either an examiner- or patient-started muscle test, a significant number do not make this distinction routinely. The majority of testers in this study did near-simultaneous testing regardless of label. Examiner and subject start times alone, as measured by sEMG, did not clearly differentiate between theorized forms of manual muscle testing. "
"Objective To illustrate a case of vertigo in a patient with cervical spine injury and mild traumatic brain injury following a motor vehicle accident and present chiropractic and rehabilitative procedures used for management. Clinical Features A 30-year-old female had neck pain, head pain, a variety of cognitive problems, vertigo, and restricted cervical range of motion following a serious motor vehicle collision. Following several weeks of chiropractic management with positive progress the patient suddenly had worsening of the vertigo and the cognitive problems. Positional vertigo was ruled out by the emergency room doctors and a neurologist. A neuropsychological assessment indicated that mild traumatic brain injury was present. Intervention The patient began chiropractic treatment with both passive and active care, prior to the vertigo incident. Following the vertigo incident, treatment was modified to include 6 weeks of cervical exercises in clinic and at home. The patient reported resolution of the vertigo following the chiropractic treatment plan. Conclusion This case reports presents an example of vertigo that improved under chiropractic management. This case illustrates the benefits of adding mild traumatic brain injury to differential diagnoses, co-managing care with other providers, and modifying treatment when necessary. Further research is suggested to study the contribution that chiropractic management could offer to those with neurological injury. "
"Objective This controlled study was designed to explore the effectiveness of foot orthotics in solving problems of the feet and other parts of the lower extremities and to reduce low back pain. Methods Thirty-two subjects (24 males) were recruited and randomly assigned into 3 study groups. There were 10 subjects in the chiropractic care plus orthotics group, 14 subjects in the orthotics group, and 8 in the control group. All subjects filled out a patient information sheet and pre-screening foot pain questionnaire. Foot orthotics information was collected and the data was sent to Foot Level-ers, Inc. for orthotic fabrication. Chiropractic treatment was performed using Activator Technique. In-home exercise was prescribed to subjects receiving orthotics and chiropractic care. Results The control group did not experience much change during the testing period. The orthotics group showed improvement in symptoms (P = 0.053), activities of daily living (P = 0.058), sport and recreation (P = 0.186) and quality of life (P = 0.085). While trends were apparent, the improvements did not reach statistically significant levels. In contrast, there was no trend with pain (P = 0.492). The orthotics plus chiropractic group showed improvement in the four conditions over the study period. Greater improvement was seen in quality of life (P < 0.05), symptoms (P < 0.05) and activities of daily living (P < 0.05), which were statistically significant. Improvement was also seen in sports and recreation but it did not reach statistical significant level (P = 0.097). Conclusion This study showed that a combination of chiropractic care and orthotics improved symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation and quality of life in workers whose job requires them to stand at least 6 hours daily.

"Objective To discover whether chiropractors consider that emotional factors are associated with pain presentations in their patients and if so, what methods they use to investigate these factors and what strategies they use to manage them. Design A telephone survey of chiropractors in Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) and North America (America and Canada). A database of practitioners was obtained for each region. A phoning protocol was established in each region to standardize the survey approach. Setting Private practice of chiropractic. Method Chiropractic centers were telephoned and the attending chiropractor(s) were asked to complete a phone survey. The survey consisted of a series of short questions designed to establish the main techniques used in the practice. Questions focused on whether emotional factors of the patient were recognized and addressed and what role emotional factors play in the management of the patient. Sample Subjects were registered/licensed chiropractors listed in a publication of the largest association of practitioners in their region. Results In Australasia and North America just under half of practitioners surveyed (45.8% and 50.5% respectively) used a technique to evaluate any impacting emotions on the presenting condition. Additionally, 36.3% of Australasia and 33.3% of North America practitioners had a technique to treat emotional factors in the patient. The study also suggests that over 90% of Australasian chiropractors and 80% of North America chiropractors consider emotional factors important in pain presentations. Conclusion This study found that a substantial number (80–90%) of the chiropractors surveyed believe that emotional factors influence pain syndromes. However, less than half of these practitioners report that they are able to evaluate emotional factors and approximately only a third report that they are able to treat them. This study shows there is a need for further research of chiropractors to be able to evaluate emotional factors and techniques that can be used to rectify emotional components of their patients' pain syndromes.

"Objective To describe the use of chiropractic care for a patient with migraine headache. Clinical Features A patient suffered from migraine headaches after an automobile accident. Neck disability scores, visual analog score, and algometry scores were used to track patient progress. Intervention and Outcome The patient's range of motion, flexibility, and strength improved following a regimen of spinal manipulation and active and passive therapeutic care. After 12 weeks of treatment, the duration, frequency, and intensity of her migraines decreased. Conclusion This case offers an example of the potential effects of chiropractic and rehabilitative treatment for migraine headache sufferers. "
"Objective To identify studies measuring garlic powder tablets effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and to investigate if studies published prior to January 1994 would perform better than those published later. Methods Using MEDLINE (January 1966 through December 2004) studies involving human subjects that examined the effect of garlic (Allium sativum) on serum lipids and blood pressure were obtained. Studies that were conducted using garlic in the form of garlic powder tablets were included in the data extraction. Correlation coefficients were calculated for total serum cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure with respect to date of publication. Trials published prior to January 1994 were placed into an “earlier” group and compared to the “latter” group of studies published from January 1994 onward. Results Eighteen trials were identified whereupon the inverse associations between total serum cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures with respect to time of publication were correlated (−0.614, −0.627, and −0.587 respectively, p < 0.05). No significant associations were observed between systolic and diastolic blood pressure with respect to total serum cholesterol (0.388 and 0.431 respectively). The following differences between the earlier and later groups were observed for total serum cholesterol (31.4 ± 19.0 vs. 3.5 ± 5.8 mg/dl, p = .004); systolic blood pressure (11.0 ± 9.2 vs. 2.0 ± 4.4 mmHg, p = .133) and diastolic blood pressure (5.8 ± 3.4 vs. 0.9 ± 2.4 mmHg, p = .018). Conclusions Publications published prior to January 1994 performed better than those published after January 1994, suggesting that allicin may be responsible for the antihypertensive effects of garlic powder tablets. However, a lack of correlation between changes in total serum cholesterol and blood pressure suggests that other organo-sulfur compounds may also play a role in the antihyper-tensive mechanisms of garlic.

"Objective To discuss the diagnosis and response to treatment of spasmodic dysphonia in a 25-year-old female vocalist following an auto accident. Clinical Features The voice disorder and neck pain appeared after the traumatic incident. Examination of the cervical spine revealed moderate pain, muscle spasm and restricted joint motion at C-1 and C-5 on the left side. Cervical range of motion was reduced on left rotation. Bilateral manual muscle testing of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, which share innervation with the laryngeal muscles by way of the spinal accessory nerve, were weak on the left side. Pre and post accident voice range profiles (phonetograms) that measure singing voice quality were examined. The pre- and post-accident phonetograms revealed significant reduction in voice intensity and fundamental frequency as measured in decibels and hertz. Intervention and Outcome Low-force chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to C-1 and C-5 was employed. Following a course of care, the patient's singing voice returned to normal, as well as a resolution of her musculo- skeletal complaints. Conclusion It appears that in certain cases, the singing voice can be adversely affected if neck or head trauma is severe enough. This case proposes that trauma with irritation to the cervical spine nerve roots as they communicate with the spinal accessory, and in turn the laryngeal nerves, may be contributory in some functional voice disorders or muscle tension dysphonia. "
Outcome measures are helpful in demonstrating patient response to care and therefore an important part of providing best care for our patients. Using paper scoring systems is one way that doctors of chiropractic can document patient progress. This update provides a brief review of the characteristics and applications of the visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric pain scale (NPS). 
"Objective To present a retrospective case report about a patient who suffered from chronic lower back pain for sixteen years, finding little relief from numerous medical and traditional chiropractic interventions, until active patient participation was incorporated in the chiropractic treatment process. Clinical Features A 43-year-old female experienced severe right lumbar, right sacrum, and right acetabular pain and muscle spasms occurring after playing a vigorous tennis match 16 years earlier. Pain intensity was rated as 8 out of 10 on a variable analog scale. Prior treatments included prolonged bed rest, cortisone injection, chiropractic manipulation, stretching, acupuncture, physical therapy, and other rehabilitation interventions. By the time of presentation she also experienced right arm and right upper back pain. A lumbar MRI scan showed an L4/5 disc bulge. Patrick's, Yeoman's and Kemp's tests were positive on her right side. She had an asymmetrical gait pattern with a right hip hike, lateral shift and rotation of the pelvis. Weakness of the left gluteus maxi-mus, gluteus medius, and right erector spinae muscles was present. Motion palpation revealed several fixations. There was tenderness to palpation of the right psoas muscle and a trigger point in the right illiacus muscle. Intervention and Outcome Home-based rehabilitation including low-tech muscle-specific patient controlled dynamic spinal stabilization exercises, cardiovascular training and various stretching techniques was incorporated with chiropractic manipulation. Significant improvement was noted within a 40 week treatment course. Conclusion Incorporation of active patient participation seemed to be a significant factor in the resolution of the patient's low back pain. Active patient participation improved the quality of life for this patient. "
"Background Subjective outcome assessment instruments may be used to determine whether changes occur as a result of a particular treatment intervention. Since 1991, 11 outcome assessment instruments either specific to or validated for use with cervical spine pathologies have been developed and their psychometric properties critically assessed. Though a systematic review of this subject was published in 2002, it included an analysis of only 5 measures available at that time. Objective To present a description of each of the 11 measures and briefly compare their psychometric properties, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change. Methods Computer-based searches of MEDLINE and CINAHL were performed to capture all data relevant to the eleven outcome assessment tools currently available. Results Data regarding descriptions, reliability and validity of 11 outcome measures were found and collated. Conclusion The choice of which outcome measurement to use becomes a matter of preference based on the particular patient population each clinician treats, the ease of use for the patient and ease of scoring for the clinician, and the domains that are most relevant to a particular patient. "
"Objective To illustrate multifaceted clinical components often present with lumbar disc herniation that require concomitant resolution before optimal conservative case management can be achieved. Clinical Features A 33-year-old male with insidious low back pain and a gradual onset of lower extremity symptoms had a declining physical activity lifestyle, diminished fitness level, and weight gain over a 4-year period. Symptoms progressively worsened over a two-year period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a disc herniation with neurological compromise and surgical intervention was medically recommended. Intervention and Outcome Management consisted of patient education, acute inflammation control, closed disc reduction, remedial therapeutic (passive joint movement) care directed at preservation and improvement of joint and soft tissue mobility, low tech physical capacity evaluation and individualized rehabilitation training for home based care exercise. Patient compliance was ultimately achieved with a positive long-term outcome. Conclusion This case illustrates common clinical components of care associated with disc herniation case management, the potential of conservative care, and the benefits of combining manual therapy and rehabilitative exercise.

"Objective To review the epidemiological literature on low back pain in golfers and to review the golf swing and relate the literature on the mechanics of the swing to the lower back. Methods A computer search was conducted of Index Medicus (1966 to 2004), MANTIS (1880 to present) and CINAHL (1982 to 2004) for literature on the following key words: low back, golf, injury. A manual search for relevant references in review papers on the subject was also conducted. The results were collated and literature fitting the criteria were collected and evaluated for suitability. Results The lower back is a common site of golf-related injury and has resulted in much research being conducted on the forces produced by the ‘modern’ swing in the low back. An analysis of the ‘modern’ swing when compared to the ‘classic’ golf swing, demonstrates lower rotational forces on the low back in the ‘classic’ swing. However, no studies exist to compare the different types of swing. Conclusion The back is an area of the body that undergoes significant movement and muscular activity during the golf swing. It is likely that the significant activity and repetitive nature of the swing are associated with the high rate of injury in golfers. Modification of the golf swing has been hypothesized to reduce the incidence of low back injury in golf. Further research needs to be conducted on the various golf swings to evaluate if different swings change low back injury rates in golfers. "
"Introduction Conditions of the hand and wrist often occur in older patients, but decision-making algorithms and manual treatment protocols for this age group have not been developed or assessed. Further, effects of age-related co-morbidities are poorly understood. Objective To build an understanding of an appropriate treatment protocol from the ground up that does not assume that generic spinal or extremity manipulative therapy is indicated. Methods The project was conducted in two phases, involving (1) interviews with chiropractors (reported here) and (2) a single cohort, longitudinal design, identifying the conditions of the hand and wrist and concomitant comorbidities as well as promising accommodations and chiropractic treatments of these symptoms in older people. In the first phase, data were gathered, through in-person focus group and telephone interviews, from 58 chiropractors treating older patients presenting with hand and wrist symptoms. Results Chiropractors indicated they accommodated treatments to the health status and co-morbidities of their older patients and considered “management,” rather than “cure,” a more realistic concept in treating chronic conditions. With older patients, chiropractors recommended using a lighter touch, rehabilitative passive stretching, traction, nutritional counseling, soft-tissue work, and home exercises. Chiropractors also cautioned providers to take extra time in history-taking and extra diligence with older patients, identifying use of medications, and conducting blood pressure, bone density, blood clotting assessments, if indicated, before treatment. Conclusions Chiropractors provided valuable orientation, indicating that caring for older patients requires careful history-taking and treatment plans that accommodate to presenting co-morbidities and the patients' general health statuses.

"Objective To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Arnica at a high potency (200c), on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. Methods Twenty subjects completed a maximal eccentric exercise protocol with the non-dominate elbow flexors to induce delayed onset muscle soreness. Either Arnica or placebo tablets were administered in a random, double- blinded fashion immediately after exercise and at 24 hours and 72 hours after exercise. Before exercise, immediately post-exercise, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-exercise, assessments of delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle function included: 1) muscle soreness and functional impairment; 2) maximum voluntary contraction torque; 3) muscle swelling; and 4) range of motion tests to document spontaneous muscle shortening and muscle shortening ability. Blood samples drawn before exercise and at 24, 48, and 96 hours after exercise were used to measure muscle enzymes as indirect indices of muscle damage. Results Regardless of the intervention, the extent of delayed onset muscle soreness and elevations in muscle enzymes were similar on the days following the eccentric exercise protocol. The post-exercise time profiles of decreases in maximum voluntary contraction torque and muscle shortening ability and increases in muscle swelling and spontaneous muscle shortening were similar for each treatment intervention. Conclusions The results of this study did not substantiate the clinical efficacy of Arnica at a high potency on moderating delayed onset muscle soreness and accompanying symptoms of muscle dysfunction. Despite the findings of this study, future investigations on the clinical efficacy of homeopathic interventions should consider incorporating research strategies that emphasize differential therapeutics for each patient rather than treating a specific disease or symptom complex, such as DOMS, with a single homeopathic remedy. "
"Objective Primary dysmenorrhea and related issues are discussed as they influence the gynecological and social health of females during adolescence, adulthood, and senior maturity. Health practitioners are exposed to multiple approaches towards the management of menstrual pain. Clinical and social viewpoints target the causation, development, diagnosis, manifestation and management of primary dysmenorrhea. This narrative review includes the topic of the doctor-patient relationship in efforts of cultivating effectively communicative health practitioners. Controversial topics related to primary dysmenorrhea and the quality of life for women are addressed. Data Sources A search for literature reviews, case studies, laboratory research, and clinical trials from 1985–2004 was performed using the MEDLINE database. Sources of additional information included textbooks, national organizational literature and contemporary articles. Discussion Menstrual pain is a prevalent experience yet it is socially taboo for conversation; as such, it poses a hindrance to its management. The communication between the doctor and patient is a critical barrier point between establishing a diagnosis and determining an appropriate treatment plan. A multi-disciple treatment plan varies as much as patients themselves vary in personal experiences, needs, and preferences. Conclusions Medicinal prophylactics, physical therapeutics, non-acidic diets, herbal supplements, eastern therapies and the chiropractic manual adjustments of the spine are effective methods for the management of primary dysmenorrhea. The non-invasive management of primary dysmenorrhea includes the chiropractic adjustment with complimentary modalities, and other alternative health care practices. Medicinal prophylactics are invasive and pose a higher risk to long-term chemical exposure, side effects or irreversible conditions. "
"Objective To introduce and describe a standardized protocol for a functional, pre-manipulative assessment procedure for spinal pain. Design Two brief case reports and the clinical utility of this maneuver is compared with another commonly used orthopedic test in a retrospective study involving 50 subjects. Setting Northwestern Health Sciences University's Bloomington Natural Care Center. Results The use of the proposed pre-manipulative orthopedic assessment maneuver may have clinical utility for patients presenting with back and/or leg pain. There were differences in the subjective responses of some subjects between the use of the torsion test and the straight leg raise and some results that suggest a correlation between the two tests. Conclusion The test described may be useful as an additional assessment procedure since it closely reflects those spinal stressors that are commonly present when manual therapy is being employed. Additionally, the torsion test may have practical utility since it can be modified to reflect different techniques employed by different health care providers. "
"It is critical for health care providers to have the skills and composure required to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when necessary. Unfortunately, it is easy to postpone updating one's CPR certification when confronted with the demands of leading a practice. New guidelines for CPR have been in effect since 2000. This clinical update provides a brief overview of the new guidelines, some suggestions for incorporating CPR training into the clinician's practice, and clarification for some common legal misconceptions that doctors may have pertaining to administering CPR. "
"Objective To summarize the literature on stress fractures amongst athletes and to present an unusual case of an L2 stress fracture in a heptathlete who was successfully treated initially with chiropractic care and then aggravated by it. Clinical Features An elite heptathlete was diagnosed with bilateral pars interarticularis stress fractures of the L2 vertebrae. She initially presented for chiropractic treatment with unremitting low back pain. This followed previous successful treatment for back pain. After a series of unsuccessful treatments a second opinion (chiropractor) was sought. After a thorough history and examination, a series of radiographs were performed. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging confirmed the presence of bilateral spondylolysis at L2. Intervention and Outcome The patient began a graduated return to function that was initially based in rest and avoidance of all extension and rotational movement of the lumbar spine. Management gradually returned the patient to general activity followed by more progressive and sport specific activity after the fracture had sufficient time to heal. Conclusions This case highlights the importance of considering the type of pain, its location, the mechanism of injury, imaging studies and the result of the treatment in the short and medium term in establishing an accurate diagnosis of stress fracture of the pars interarticularis. "
"Objective The goals of this study were to measure the kinetic profile of thrust in different groups of subjects with various levels of expertise and to quantify general coordination while performing thoracic spine manipulation. Participants A total of 43 students and chiropractors from the Chiropractic Department of the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières participated in this study. Methods Participants were asked to complete ten consecutive thoracic spine manipulations on an instrumented manikin. Peak force, preload force, time to peak force, time to peak force variability, peak force variability, rate of force production and unloading time were compared between groups. Hand-body delay obtained by calculating the temporal lag between the onset of unloading and the onset of peak force application was also compared between groups. Results No group difference was observed for the peak force, peak force variability and preload force variables. However, group differences were present for variables like time to peak force, time to peak force variability, rate of force production, unloading time and hand-body delay. Conclusion This study demonstrates clear differences between groups of subjects with different levels of expertise in thoracic spine manipulation. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of a simple, instrumented manikin to analyze spinal manipulation and identify important parameters related to expertise. "
"Purpose To determine the self-concepts of chiropractic students as science students and if any personal variable affect their self-concepts. Participants Students in their first trimester and eighth trimester at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic during the 1993 academic year (n=158). Methods Peterson-Yaakobi Q-Sort, National Assessment of Educational Progress, two-tailed T-test, one way analysis of variance and Spearman-rho correlation. Results The majority of students have positive self- concepts as science students and although there was a difference between the 2 trimesters, it was not significant. As a group they generally had less exposure to science compared to undergraduates from a selected science program. Variables of socio-economic status, undergraduate major, and highest completed level of education did not statistically affect their self-concept. Conclusion Chiropractic students had the self-concept that enables them to subscribe to the philosophical foundations of science and better engage in basic sciences and, later, science-based clinical research. Knowledge of this self- concept can be used in the development of a more rigorous basic science curricula and clinical research programs at chiropractic colleges with the ultimate goal of providing a more firm scientifically based foundation for the profession.

"Objective To describe a case report of the use of 3 treatment methods for treatment of cervical radiculitis; manual intermittent traction, instrumental chiropractic spinal manipulation, and interferential therapy. Clinical Features A 54-year-old man experienced neck and left arm pain with positive orthopedic tests indicating cervical spinal nerve root involvement; he was diagnosed with cervical radiculitis Intervention and Outcome The patient received 10 treatments over a period of 8 weeks. Instrumental spinal manipulation, manual intermittent traction, and interferential therapy were integrated as a treatment plan for the patient. The patient's condition appeared to resolve. Outcome measures were evaluated at baseline, weeks 3, 5, and 8. Neck Disability Index scores were 32%, 14%, 8%, and 4% respectively, and the Visual Analog Scales were 8.5/10, 2.0/10, 1.0/10, and 0.5/10. The symptoms of cervical radiculitis was resolved in an 8 week period after 10 treatments. Conclusion The integration of instrumental spinal manipulation, manual intermittent traction, and interferential may work well together for patients with similar signs and symptoms as presented in this case.

"Objective To see if chiropractic manipulative therapy and/or a targeted stabilization training program can help a patient for whom several other treatment methods had failed. Clinical Features The 52-year-old male patient had been unable to stand for prolonged periods and was progressively getting worse for a year under various treatment protocols prior to seeking chiropractic care. His pain had progressed from foot pain to bilateral sciatica, and he was also experiencing thoracic pain and cervicalgia with headaches. He had identifiable muscle weakness, loss of range of motion and paresthesia. He had been unemployed for over a year. Intervention and Outcome The patient underwent an 8-week period of comprehensive chiropractic manipulative therapy followed by an 8-week period of targeted low back stability training designed to address identified muscular weakness with no chiropractic therapy. At the end of each 8-week period, the patient reported significant improvement. At the end of treatment, the patient returned to the workforce. Conclusion The use of chiropractic manipulative therapy and a targeted stabilization program appear to be 2 effective treatment protocols for sciatica and paresthesia. The outcome of this study suggests that combining the 2 protocols may result in quicker, more effective recovery. Further investigation as to the effectiveness of a combined treatment program is suggested. It was also noted that chiropractic manipulative therapy was effective treatment for cervicogenic headaches. "
"Objective To describe a common musculoskeletal disorder from a chiropractic management prospective, subsequently to stimulate further research into the chiropractic therapeutic effects on such cases and to contribute to chiropractic literature. Clinical Features A 27-year-old, 76” male student often involved in athletic activities, had a sudden onset of continuous localized pain in the medial aspect of the mid and forefoot on the right side for 1-and-a half months. The onset of pain was related to an accidental injury while playing basketball. The pain worsened every time during and after playing basketball and other weight-bearing activities such as walking upstairs and is palliated with physical rest. He tried Biofreeze and ice application for several times immediately after the injuries which help to some extent to relieve pain and swelling, but he did not seek any other professional care. The condition had been improving slowly even before he came to the clinic although the patient described the pain as 5/10 on the Borg pain scale when he came to the clinic for the first time. The characteristic local findings were a mildly hyper-pronated right foot, mildly asymmetric soft-tissue and bony contours, tenderness, stiffness and decreased range of motion (ROM) at the first metatarsophalangel and adjacent joints on the medial aspect of the midfoot decreased fluid motions in the concerned joints on the chiropractic evaluation and some abnormal wearing in the shoes. Intervention and Outcome He was managed with chiropractic manipulation combined with other conservative measures. Range of motion (ROM), Borg Pain Scale and an orthopedic test (Morton's Test) were used as the outcome measures. The subject showed a favorable response to the conservative (chiropractic) care. Conclusion Although hallux rigidus is one of the most common musculoskeletal degenerative conditions, our conservative management received a favorable response but there has been little discussion about it in chiropractic literature. It can be hypothesized that the progress of Hallux Rigidus (HR) can be reversed or halted by chiropractic management provided it is started at the early stage of the disease. "

"Objective To demonstrate the benefits of a hyperimmune egg powder supplement for treating irritable bowel syndrome in 2 patients. Clinical Features The first patient, not under chiropractic care, had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome by her primary care physician. She sought care due to failure of several other alternative therapies. Her primary care physician ordered specific dietary modifications, yet this regimen did not appear to improve her symptoms. The second patient, also diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome by her primary care physician, decided to seek care because the attending physician was concurrently treating her for idiopathic scoliosis, and both treatments could be administered at 1 office visit. Her primary reason for seeking this treatment was her longstanding episodic intestinal cramping and diarrhea. She overheard another patient in the same clinic discussing how the hyperimmune egg powder had alleviated her digestive complaints and decided to undergo a 2-week trial of the hyperimmune egg powder. Intervention and Outcome The first subject was given a 31- day supply of the hyperimmune egg powder. She reported significant subjective improvement in frequency of defecation and stool consistency after 48 hours. She kept a daily journal to monitor her bowel habits during the trial period. The second subject was provided a 15-day supply of hyperimmune egg powder and instructed to keep the same daily journal to monitor her bowel habits. During the second week of the trial, she noticed less frequent bowel habits and a more solid stool consistency. However, shortly after she stopped taking the hyperimmune egg powder, the pre-trial symptoms returned. Because of this, she was put back on the hyperimmune egg powder, and the symptoms improved thereafter. Conclusion The addition of hyperimmune egg powder into an ordinary daily diet may have improved bowel function in 2 subjects, at least subjectively. However, it is unclear whether the subjective improvements are due to the hyperimmune egg powder or any psychosomatic effect created by physician contact, regardless of treatment type. This study should be repeated on a larger scale with a control group before any conclusions are made. "
"Functional capacity evaluation (FCE) may be defined as a systematic, comprehensive, and objective measurement of an individual's maximum abilities (ADL or work). The effect of the examinee's impairment on his or her ability to perform purposeful tasks is the focus of functional and/or work capacity evaluation (FCE/WCE). The common thread that connects all FCEs is the need for an evaluation of an individual with an unresolved residual. The forensic examiner must be able to determine the most suitable process from the 5 different types of evaluation processes involving functional capacity evaluations. The College on Forensic Sciences (CFS) has identified that most FCE administrators are not sufficiently grounded in science, case law and forensic issues. Examples may include misquoting standard journal articles and texts, making false statements, providing “junk science” opinions and interpretation, and deliberately omitting important facts and knowledge. In this day and age of managed care, cost containment of workers’ compensation (fee schedules) claims, and economic incentives can change the position of the test administrators, therapists or providers. Through specialized training to better understand the requirements and needs of the courts, the forensic examiner can become a valuable tool in providing an “evidenced-based” opinion regarding FCE/WCE questions. This training should prepare the provider in FCE/WCE methods, forensic analysis and principles that have a reliable evidence-based reasoning and methodology that is scientifically valid. "
"Objective To describe two cases of abrupt resolution of chronic, recurrent, inversion sprain to ankles in young recreational athletes. Clinical Features A 13-year-old, female, avid recreational soccer player with ankles that would spontaneously invert during various inconsistent points in the weight bearing gait cycle, sometimes with acute pain or sprain to the ankle. No intervention was attempted prior to her entry to the chiropractic office. A 17-year-old male avid skate- boarder and snowboarder whose left ankle routinely “gave out” into inversion upon mundane weight bearing activity, usually with pain and with dependence on wearing an ankle support when skateboarding to lessen ankle pain. The patient had used an ankle support prior to seeking chiropractic care. Intervention and Outcome High velocity, low amplitude chiropractic manipulative therapy applied to the spine, pelvis and extremity joints was the primary intervention in both cases, with particular focus on the ankle. Other procedures used included taping and orthotics, but not before the manipulation effect was noted. Conclusion High velocity, low amplitude chiropractic manipulative therapy to the spine, pelvis, and extremities, particularly at the ankle, should be considered when managing young recreational athletes with functional chronic, recurrent, ankle inversion sprains. "
"Objective To present recommendations for conservative strategies to improve the management of uncomplicated back pain and to evaluate the financial crisis currently facing the workers' compensation system due in part to rapidly rising medical costs. Background Medical costs in the workers' compensation system have risen at an alarming rate placing a tremendous burden on the cost of doing business in the United States. Historically, treatment for back pain in the United States has been a pathology-based approach; the literature supports a functional restorative approach for clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. Design Narrative overview of the literature. Methods Computerized databases were searched for relevant literature in the English language from the years 1994–2004, including: Alternative Health Watch; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Pre-CINAHL; CINAHL; MEDLINE; AgeLine; SPORT Discus. A narrative synthesis of the literature was written from retrieved articles. Discussion A history and overview of the workers' compensation system is presented. Concerns regarding rising medical costs and recommendations for strategies to improve cost and quality of care with an emphasis on ergonomic and functional restoration recommendations are made. Conclusion A percentage of costs in the workers' compensation system go towards treating uncomplicated back pain; recurrences and chronicity of back pain are key contributors to these costs, which are currently increasing. Ergonomic advice plays a key role in helping the patient with musculoskeletal injuries heal faster and prevent costly flare-ups. Conservative care, which includes chiropractic manipulation, ergonomic recommendations, and exercise rehabilitation with an emphasis on coordination and endurance training, is supported by the literature as a possible method of cost containment.

"Objective To present a chiropractic treatment plan for a patient with lumbar disc herniation including radicular symptoms below the knee. Clinical Features A 38-year-old male experienced lumbar disc herniation with radicular symptoms to the lower extremities, below the knee. Etiology of this episode included a traumatic injury which was complicated by chronic degenerative joint and disc changes. Intervention and Outcome The treatment regime included chiropractic spinal manipulation, modalities and exercise rehabilitation. Specific rehabilitation exercises were used during various stages of healing in an attempt to stabilize a potential surgical case. Goals of care were to alleviate pain, increase function, and decrease peripheralization related to disc herniation in this case. The patient reached a level of functional biomechanical stability over 15 weeks. Conclusion This case demonstrates that with proper management, rehabilitation of a patient with disc herniation can be reached in a short duration of time. "
"Objective To discuss the treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes presenting with chronic neck and shoulder pain by using chiropractic manipulation and an active rehabilitation program with emphasis on correcting postural imbalances. Clinical Features A 46-year-old insulin dependant (type1) diabetic female presented with neck and right shoulder pain of 6 to 8 months duration. Her history included similar left-sided complaints 2 years prior at which time she underwent 3 months of rehabilitation at a local medical center, which improved her condition. Over time her pain resolved but the residuals of restricted left shoulder range of motion remained. The patient had postural changes consisting of forward head posture, rounded shoulders and internally rotated arms. Intervention and Outcome Treatment included spinal manipulation, ultrasound and active rehabilitation consisting of at home exercises initially and followed with in office low-tech rehabilitation. Rehabilitation was primarily aimed at improving postural abnormalities, muscle imbalances and abnormal movement patterns. The patient improved with this course of treatment. Conclusion Chiropractic care including active rehabilitation may be helpful in treating diabetic patients suffering from chronic neck and shoulder problems. "
"In order to provide better care to patients, doctors of chiropractic should be informed about adverse affects of certain drugs. Presently, questions are being raised about cardiovascular risks, such as increased deaths due to stroke or myocardial infarction, which may be caused from drugs in the same class as Vioxx®.1 Therefore, it is important for doctors of chiropractic to stay apprised of information that may affect the health of their patients, such as COX-2 inhibitor usage. 1 1 "
"Objective To determine the accuracy of instrumented, prone compressive leg checking. Design Point measures (n=29) on single participants. Setting Chiropractic college research clinic. Methods A pair of surgical boots was modified to permit continuous measurement of leg length inequality (LLI). The accuracy of prone leg checking for a masked examiner (n = 29) was determined, against the gold standard of artificial LLI that was created by randomly inserting zero to six 1.6 mm shims in either boot. Accuracy was defined as the examiner's ability to correctly assess the change in the number and side of shims inserted, in two consecutive observations per participant. Linear regression and Bland-Altman statistics were obtained to determine the concurrent validity of compressive leg checking compared to a reference standard. Results The observed and artificial LLI shared 86% of their variation (n = 29) The mean examiner error was 2.7 mm and the accuracy of dichotomous short leg determination for two shim insertions was 86.2%. The 95% confidence interval for the Bland-Altman limits-of-agreement for observed vs. artificial change in LLI was (−7.6, +5.2). Conclusions Instrumented, compressive leg checking seems highly accurate, detecting artificial changes in leg length of 2–3 mm, and thus possesses concurrent validity assessed against artificial LLI. Pre- and post leg check differences should exceed about 4–6 mm to be highly confident a real change has occurred. It is unknown whether compressive leg checking is clinically relevant. "
"Objective To describe a novel program in the area of workers' compensation-based chiropractic care in Alabama developed at the request of third-party administrators handling workers' compensation claims. Discussion The system of workers' compensation in Alabama is unique in that the employer and the insurance carrier or third party administrator can determine where the injured worker is seen, by what doctor and what type of doctor. A medical panel of doctors must be available to the injured but it does not, by law, have to include a doctor of chiropractic. Many injuries on the job are related to the spine and musculoskeletal system, which are commonly treated in the chiropractor's office. This article describes a program that led to doctors of chiropractic having an expanded role in the management of work-related injuries in Alabama, prior to which access to care had been significantly restricted. Conclusion A needs-based system of communication and self- discipline within a group of clinicians can overcome barriers to patient access through improved relationships with third-party administrators in the workers' compensation system.

"Objective To investigate the possible benefits of using Pettibon corrective procedures to reduce the curvature associated with idiopathic scoliosis. These procedures were tested to determine potential effectiveness in a single patient. Clinical Features A patient with a 35° left convex thoracolumbar scoliosis was treated using Pettibon corrective procedures. Initial and follow-up outcome measures included a Borg pain scale, a Functional Rating Index, a balance test, and radiographic analysis. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated using a combination of manipulative and rehabilitative procedures designed to restore normal sagittal curves and reduce the severity of the coronal curvatures. After six weeks of treatment, the post treatment radiograph revealed a 20° left convex thoracolumbar scoliosis, as well as decreases in the Borg pain scale from six to two, and Functional Rating Index score from 18/40 to 7/40 after the trial period. Her balance time increased from 18 seconds to 56 seconds. Conclusion Pettibon corrective procedures seemed to be effective at reducing the thoracolumbar scoliosis 15° (43%) after six weeks. The subjective and objective results of this case study warrant further such investigations. "
"Objective To discuss management of postsurgical lumbar disc herniation using a program of chiropractic manipulation and an active rehabilitation program. Clinical Features The patient was a 54-year-old Caucasian male with a history of acute low back pain and left sciatic pain down the left posterior thigh and lateral calf and numbness in the dorsum of the left foot. Prior medical intervention included treatment with steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and lumbar microdiscectomy surgery, with incomplete resolution of his symptoms. The patient was unable to walk without pain or return to normal activities of daily living. He was antalgic in flexion. His lumbar range of motion was restricted in flexion and extension. He exhibited a positive straight leg raise and exhibited foot drop on the left. Intervention and Outcome The treatment plan and intervention consisted of patient education on proper posture and proper bending and lifting techniques. Rehabilitative exercise began in the office and progressed to home based therapy and exercises. He noticed a decrease in his signs and symptoms after seven visits. Active rehabilitation was continued with the goal of returning lumbar spinal extensor strength. He was released to home therapy and supportive chiropractic care with continued positive response. Conclusion Management of postsurgical lumbar disc herniation with chiropractic and active rehabilitation is discussed. Spinal deconditioning and a weakness of the lumbar spinal extensor muscles appeared to be related to the patient's symptoms. Patient education on proper posture, proper lifting techniques, core stabilization exercises, active strengthening exercise and chiropractic manipulation appeared effective in this case. "
"Objective This case report describes a young adolescent baseball player with right heel pain. Clinical Features An 11 year old male baseball player experiencing right medial calcaneal pain of several days duration. Running increased his pain and he had suffered mild pain in this area 1 year previously. He experienced tenderness to palpation over the right posterior-medial calcaneous and mild pain on toe walking. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated with gentle mobilization to the ankle mortice, subtalar, and fore foot areas and electrical stimulation and ice to the calcaneal area. The patient was instructed in stretching of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia and the use of ice application intermittently especially after aggravating activity. Conclusion The patient had right posterior medial heel pain that was aggravated by running and responded well to physical therapy modalities, stretching and mild modification of aggravating activity. This case illustrates that it is important to consider and recognize early calcaneal apophysitis in the adolescent and prompt conservative treatment generally produces excellent result. "

"Objective To systematically review published prospective trials relating to the homeopathic treatment of tension type, cervicogenic, and migraine headache. Data Sources Pre-MEDLINE, MEDLINE, MANTIS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and AMED were searched from the initial indexing year of each database through May 2002. Studies were further identified through a manual search of obtained article references. Study Selection English and non-English randomized clinical trials and prospective observational trials were included if there were at least ten subjects in the homeopathic portion of the trial and, for randomized clinical trials, if there was a placebo group. Treatment in these studies included single dose and individualized homeopathic prescription. Case studies, homeopathic provings, unpublished material, non-peer reviewed papers, and studies that combined multiple homeopathic remedies, introduced other complementary and alternative medicine therapies and/or introduced additional medical therapy for patients in the homeopathic treatment groups were excluded. Data Extraction Qualitative data were extracted from each paper and entered into an evidence table. Data Synthesis A critical evaluation list of 20 methodological items and their operational definitions was used, resulting in a validity score determined for each paper. Results Six papers met criteria for inclusion. Three out of the six papers studied migraine headache, two studied cervicogenic and tension type headache, and one included all types of headaches. Four studies were randomized clinical trials, and two were prospective observational studies. Validity scores ranged from 25.0% to 63.4%. Homeopathy was superior to placebo in one randomized clinical trial and equal to placebo in three randomized trials. In no study was homeopathy less effective than placebo in treating headache, or harmful. Two prospective observational studies demonstrated improvement in patients receiving homeopathic care. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of homeopathy for managing tension type, cervicogenic, or migraine headache. The studies reviewed possessed several flaws in design. Given these findings, further research is warranted to better investigate the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment of headaches. "
Objective To review the literature of the biomechanics of the windmill fast-pitch and its implications for injury. This information may be utilized in treating youth windmill pitchers. Data Source A MEDLINE search was conducted to retrieve articles regarding the windmill pitch. Key terms were then taken from the pilot search and used to conduct a systematic search and review of the literature. Results Articles containing information on the windmill pitch and injuries associated with the motion were reviewed. Additional information pertaining to the overhand baseball pitch and overuse injuries in youth were analyzed and synthesized into the body of information. Conclusion A complex sequence of actions is required to successfully perform the windmill pitch. Overuse injuries are common in windmill pitchers. A well-designed conditioning schedule and the regulation of the frequency and volume of pitching in youth fast-pitch may assist with managing injury associated with this activity. Further investigation of specific treatment methods is needed. 
"As the profession of chiropractic grows in stature within our society, the morality of each chiropractor's conduct will be increasingly examined and scrutinized by the public, the media, the government and the profession itself. Immoral conduct occurs not by just a few unscrupulous individuals, but by a host of apparently good, successful professionals who lead what appear to be exemplary private lives. Recent increasing examples of professional and corporate moral decay as reported by chiropractic state boards, in print media, etc., should spur chiropractic colleges to make determined efforts to reemphasize ethics as part of the core curriculum. Ethical judgments depend upon both the decision making process itself and the experience, intelligence and integrity of the decision maker. The College on Forensic Sciences (CFS), a subsidiary of the American Chiropractic Association's (ACA's) Council on Chiropractic Orthopedics (CCO), developed a guideline of conduct to assist forensic examiners in making decisions in their every day subspecialty practice. Guidelines provide guideposts that can be helpful in assisting forensic examiners in evaluating the circumstances they are encountering and providing possible approaches that may be taken in addressing the ethical issues involved.

"Objective To discuss attachment disorders; most specifically, Reactive Attachment Disorder, its etiology, background causes, symptoms, and its prevention with the intervention of allopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, and osteopathic physicians. Methods An online search and review of the literature regarding Reactive Attachment Disorder was performed through Pubmed and Google. The articles, interview information, and books utilized for this paper were selected by historical significance, date of publication, pertinent information, and, most specifically, those sources of pertinent data regarding Reactive Attachment Disorder. Discussion Reactive Attachment Disorder is a mental health disease with neurological implications, which may be caused by abuse during the first five years of life. Recognition of this disease, its background causes, and knowledge of effective parenting guidelines, are reasonable expectations for all physicians and mental health care providers. Conclusion A collaborative effort by all physicians to prevent Reactive Attachment Disorder through the implementation of effective parenting might reduce the incidence of this mental health disease in children and adults.

"Objective To describe and discuss the health care needs within the sport of adventure racing, specifically relating to the parameters for sports chiropractors serving at such events, and to help further develop these in a scholarly format to assist in overcoming the paucity of such information. Methods A review of the diminutive literature base available pertaining to adventure racing was used in conjunction with a retrospective analysis of injury statistics from a multi-day adventure race. Discussion Adventure racing is an ultra-endurance, multi-discipline, team sport. Races typically cover great distances, often under brutal conditions and circumstances. Training for and competing in such events frequently causes deleterious health consequences and sports chiropractors are uniquely qualified to provide treatment for most of these problems. Specific preparatory and participatory parameters are discussed to assist the sports chiropractor in his or her health care service role within the sport of adventure racing. Conclusion Adventure racing is a new and expanding sport, and so is chiropractic's role of involvement. Few published papers exist in peer-reviewed journals relative to what health care providers can expect at adventure races, and how they can most effectively participate. This paper adds published material to the scientific literature regarding the health care needs and the treatment parameters within the sport of adventure racing. "

"Measurement of spinal range of motion (ROM) along with strength, endurance, coordination, and sensation are among the essential determinants of musculoskeletal function. These measurements are important to the chiropractic physician concentrating in the fields of impairment rating, disability evaluation and independent medical examination (forensic examiner). An important initial step toward standardizing measurement of joint motion has been undertaken by the American Medical Association with their publication The Practical Guide to Range of Motion Assessment. Their publication is an attempt to provide a detailed and illustrated description of a standardized approach to ROM measurement and recording. The College on Forensic Sciences (CFS) is spear- heading an effort to encourage and provide detailed instruction on measuring range of motion according to this companion book to the AMA Guides. This attempt at providing a systematic format should enable chiropractic (forensic) evaluators to obtain more reliable range of motion measurements/data by using the same standardized protocols, reference tables, and reporting methods.

"Objective This case report describes a long distance runner with low-back pain and sacroiliac pain and proposes iliotibial band tightness as a possible causative factor. Clinical Features A 38-year-old female amateur runner experienced an exacerbation of right-sided lower back and sacroiliac pain, which she had experienced for several months. The problem became worse as she increased the miles she ran. She had a positive Noble compression test and tightness of the iliotibial band on the right. Gaenslen's, Kemp's, and Patrick's tests were negative on the right, but created her pain of chief complaint. Trigger points were found in the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and tensor fascia lata muscles. Intervention and Outcome The patient was treated using chiropractic manipulative therapy, trigger point therapy and stretching of the iliotibial band. Her running schedule was also changed; at the beginning of treatment, she stopped running. As she progressed, she ran on flat surfaces, and with further rehabilitation, she resumed her pre-injury schedule and route. She did not demonstrate much improvement until extensive stretching was included in the treatment plan. Conclusion A patient had low back and sacroiliac pain that seemed to originate from a dysfunctional iliotibial band. This case illustrates that it is important to consider iliotibial band tightness as a possible cause of low back and sacroiliac pain and that proper management may need to include stretching of the iliotibial band along with trigger point therapy and chiropractic manipulation.

"Connective Tissue (CT) is a ubiquitous component of all major tissues and structures of the body (50% of all body protein is CT), including that of the blood, vascular, muscle, tendon, ligament, fascia, bone, joint, IVD's (intervertebral discs) and skin. Because of its ubiquitous nature, CT is an often overlooked component of any essential nutritional program that may address the structure, and/or function of these tissues. The central role of CT in the health of a virtually all cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems, is discussed. General nutritional CT support strategies, as well as specific CT support strategies that focus on blood, vascular, structural system (eg, muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, bone, and joints), integument (skin) and inflammatory and immune mediation will be discussed here and will deal with connective tissue dynamics and dysfunction. An overview of the current scientific understanding and possible options for naturally enhancing the structure and function of CT through the application of these concepts will be discussed in this article, with specific attention on the vascular and hematological systems.

"Objective The purpose of the present study was to examine 1) whether Isometric Handgrip (IHG) training lowers arterial pressure at rest and 2) whether possible reductions in arterial pressure are associated with reductions in the heart rate variability (HRV). Methods This case series consisted of 2 hypertensive female subjects who were trained with four 3-minute bouts of IHG) exercise at 30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) separated by 5-minute rest periods. Training was performed 4 times per week for 4 weeks. Subjects’ resting arterial pressure were measured before and after training each day for 4 consecutive days, with HRV recorded on the third day each week. Results In the first subject, resting diastolic pressure decreased from 120 to 90 mmHg and systolic arterial pressure decreased from 160 to 140 mmHg, whereas heart rate increased from 52 to 55 beats/min, and HRV did not change following training. The decrease in blood pressure was seen after 3 weeks of handgrip exercise. In the second subject, no trend of blood pressure reduction was seen but the systolic arterial pressure decreased before and after the handgrip exercise at 10 training days out of the 17 possible days. In the other 7 days, 6 days showed no blood pressure changes after handgrip exercise. The HRV in the LF, HF, VLF ranges did not change with training. Discussion Handgrip exercise moderately reduced blood pressure in the 2 female hypertensive subjects. The reduction of blood pressure and response to HRV seemed to relate to subject's history of using hypertensive medication. Conclusion IHG training might be an effective nonpharmacological intervention in lowering arterial pressure. Further study is needed. "

"The intent of this article is to provide a format for chiropractors to learn a Sacro-Occipital Technique (SOT) adjusting procedure (known as Disc Technique) for treating patients with lumbar discogenic syndromes. Disc Technique along with the ‘Step Out Toe Out’ procedure (SOTO) are central to the SOT Category III protocol. Other SOT Category III procedures will be discussed so that Disc Technique can be understood in its context. Disc Technique requires only a stool or an armless chair, a willing patient and your thumb. "

"Objective This case presentation describes a method of evaluation and a conservative management plan for a child with probable inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's Disease). Possible causes for this clinical presentation and a brief review of the literature are offered. Clinical Features A 9-year-old female had a history of headaches, stomach ache, foulsmelling soft stools, canker and cold sores, dry skin, stuffy nose with postnasal drip, difficulty concentrating in school, mood swings and growing pains with leg cramps. She also had a trace of fecal blood. A Urine OrganiX Profile and the Food Antibody Assessment was ordered demonstrating metabolic changes and food sensitivities. Intervention and Outcome In this case, following a clinical laboratory assessment, treatment was initiated using nutrients and dietary changes. Fourteen months after consultation, the patient was symptom-free and her final laboratory assessment was essentially negative. She learned to work with her diet and the consequences resulting from breaking it. Conclusions There is the need for a conservative approach to evaluation and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease before considering other more aggressive and potentially hazardous approaches. The patient's signs and symptoms responded to a unique method of evaluation and conservative management when other approaches had failed. "
The exceptional growth of allergies in recent years has been attributed to an increase in hygienic conditions which is linked to an under development of the immune system. This can be counteracted by the use of beneficial bacterial cultures (probiotics) which can provide a safe alternative for immune development. 
"Objective To test the hypothesis that restoring the lumbar lordosis will increase a patient's voluntary muscular strength and decrease back pain symptoms. Clinical Features A patient was diagnosed with mechanical low back pain. The initial radiographic study revealed a loss of the lumbar lordosis. The patient determined his maximum bench press prior to the treatment program. The treatment outcome was based upon post-intervention radiographs, a Borg pain scale, and the patient's post-intervention maximum bench press. Intervention and Outcome The treatment program consisted of warm-up exercises, spinal manipulation, rehabilitative exercises, neuromuscular re-education, and prescribed home care. The treatment period consisted of 12 visits in the first 4 weeks, followed by once weekly for another 12 weeks, for a total of 24 visits in 4 months. In the first month, the Borg scale decreased from 5/10 to 0/10, and after 4 months the lumbar lordosis was increased from 2° to 31°. The sacral base angle (Ferguson's angle) increased from 18° to 31°. The patient's maximum bench press also increased from 245 pounds to 305 pounds. Conclusion Restoration of the lumbar lordosis appears to have a positive effect on muscular strength. This study supports the previous premise that a lumbar lordosis provides an inherent mechanical advantage for strength and stability. "
"Objective To describe a unique method of evaluation and a conservative management plan for patients with shoulder dysfunction of mechanical origin. Possible causes for this clinical presentation and a brief review of the literature are offered. Clinical Features In the 3 cases described here, symptoms included acute shoulder pain, limitation of movement, positive orthopedic tests, palpable tenderness, muscle spasm and muscle weakness. The 3 cases all resulted in differing diagnoses. Intervention and Outcome Following the use of a proposed joint dysfunction isolation test, thrusting forms of manual adjusting procedures, electrical modalities and soft tissue therapy were applied. Three cases representing different common shoulder problems (an acute episode of a chronic problem, a progressive problem resulting in capsulitis, and a occult problem associated with a motor vehicle accident) responded favorably to treatment. Conclusions There is the need for a non-surgical, conservative approach to treatment of shoulder problems before considering the more aggressive treatment approaches that carry greater iatrogenic risks. The patients’ signs and symptoms responded to a unique method of evaluation and manipulative therapy when other approaches had failed. The risk/benefit ratio suggests that conservative care be considered a potential option for similar conditions. "

"Background Cervical spine ROM movements taken accurately with reliable measuring devices are important in outcome measures as well as in measuring disability. Objective To compare the active cervical spine ROM in healthy young adult population using 4 different goniometers. Methods Subjects were tested during active cervical spine ROM. The devices were a single hinge inclinometer, single bubble carpenter's inclinometer, dual bubble goniometers and Cybex EDI 320 electrical inclinometer. All subjects were tested for rotational limits along each of the orthogonal axes of movement. There are 3 trials for each movement direction, except rotation was not measured with the Cybex as per manual suggestions. The subjects were randomly assigned to the sequence of devices. Subjects Twenty-seven student volunteers (19 men and 8 women) were tested. Ages ranged from 21 to 41, mean age of 27.6 years of age. Data Active cervical spine ROM trials for each measurement was used to calculate mean and standard deviation. An overall analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni adjusted T-test were determined in order to calculate reliability and significance. Discussion The cost of the instruments were not used in determining reliability or significance. The single hinge inclinometer was found to be a reliable measure but not likely valid. The Cybex EDI 320 was found to be the best measuring device; however, the 2 instruments whose cost were in-between the single hinge inclinometer and the electrical goniometer were just as reliable as the more expensive device. The AMA Guides of Impairment were used as the normative data to compare these devices. Conclusion Since the devices could measure reliably, whether expensive or more cost effective for students they would likely make adequate devices for training students on the methods for measuring ROM. There is previous data to suggest that older populations have gender differences and age differences with ROM. This study could not measure that and would make a useful follow-up study. "
"Objective To describe the importance of health promotion techniques and use of active disease prevention techniques as part of chiropractic practice through a selective review of literature using a mnemonic device. Discussion There is evidence that doctors of chiropractic use some health promotion techniques in practice such as instruction on exercise, dietary advice, smoking cessation recommendations and the encouraging of preventive chiropractic visits. Healthy People goals for the nation suggest that providers encourage preventive services, work toward better access to care and stress disease prevention. However, information on how this can be routinely done in chiropractic practice is fragmented. This article suggests ways to implement health promotion into the everyday management of the chiropractic patient. Conclusion Health promotion and disease prevention can be easily performed in chiropractic practice. The nature of the chiropractic supportive or maintenance visit gives doctors a unique platform on which they can launch full-scale health promotion efforts on their patients. "
"Objective In this current study, radiographs were taken to determine whether pelvic distortions could be demonstrated on x-ray when pelvic blocks were placed under the patient in the prone position. Methods One patient was placed prone in a neutral position and radiographs were taken in a neutral position, and then with a pair of pelvic blocks placed under the subject in each of 4 different positions: (Right Short Leg - Category One) left iliac crest, right greater trochanter; (Left short Leg – Category One) right iliac crest, left greater trochanter; (SB+) left and right iliac crests; and (SB−) left and right greater trochanters. Results Findings indicated that pelvic block placement could create or affect distortions of the pelvis. Conclusion Further studies are indicated correlating radiographic analysis, pain provocation, and muscle strength to determine if a clear pelvic block preference can be determined definitively. "
"Objective To describe a novel approach to correcting cervical hyperlordosis and forward head posture in the treatment of mid-thoracic pain using specific rehabilitative equipment Clinical Features A 27-yr-old male patient had a chief complaint of intense, episodic mid-thoracic pain. A posture examination revealed several abnormalities, including apparent thoracic humping or buckling, along with significantly rounded shoulders. Radiological study resulted in a finding of a 52° cervical lordosis and forward head posture (FHP) validated by 2 separate measurements. Intervention and Outcome Treatment included 10 visits in 24 days, consisting of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) combined with a 4-lb headweight device and a figure-8 clavicle brace, followed by positional traction on an intersegmental traction table. Specific instructions for home care were provided to the patient. Post-trial radiographs showed a reduced cervical lordosis of 40° and a reduction in FHP of 12mm, according to 1 of the 2 FHP measurements. An incidental improvement was also recorded for the lumbar lordosis. Patient symptoms were alleviated by the end of the trial period. Conclusion This comprehensive approach appeared to correct specific posture abnormalities seen on x-ray, and had an apparent positive effect on the patient's chief complaint. Each procedure in this treatment method needs to be tested separately to determine which procedures had the greatest effect. "
"Objective To discusses management of cervicogenic headache by chiropractic manipulation and an active rehabilitation program. Clinical Features A 28-year-old female had headaches of approximately a 10-year duration that were located on the right occipital-cervical region with radiation into the right paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine. Prior allopathic intervention included pharmaceutical approaches without resolution of symptoms. The area involved demonstrated marked point tenderness to static/motion palpation techniques. Manual resisted muscle testing of the sub-occpitals, upper trapezious, levator scapulae and the rhomboids decreased her pain, while testing of the anterior scalenes and sternocleidomastoids muscles created an increase in her pain. Seated cervical spine range of motion was diminished in all ranges and was limited by an increase in her pain of the right sub-occipital joint. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Intervention and Outcome Treatment plan and intervention included patient education in posture and an in-office treatment program progressing to home therapy was reviewed with the patient. She noticed an increase in signs and symptoms after her first 3 visits followed by a decrease in her primary signs and symptoms during visits 3–5. An in-office active rehabilitation program was included with a continued positive response. She was released to home therapy and supportive chiropractic manipulation with continued positive response. Conclusion Management of cervicogenic headaches with chiropractic manipulation and rehabilitation is discussed. A literature review is included. Past trauma with altered postural biomechanics appeared to be the cause in this particular case. Management strategies including education of proper biomechanics, rehabilitation and chiropractic manipulation were effective in this case. "

"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of Pettibon spinal manipulation and anterior headweighting for correct cervical hypolordosis and forward head posture, quantified by measurements taken from pre and post intervention lateral cervical radiographs. Methods A total of 15 subjects were selected for investigation at random. An initial seated lateral cervical radiograph was taken to evaluate forward head posture and the amount of cervical lordosis. A series of 3 manipulative procedures were performed, followed immediately by introduction of an anterior headweight device. This headweight device was worn for 5 minutes while walking on a treadmill. A post intervention seated lateral cervical radiograph was taken while each subject wore the headweight. Measurements of cervical lordosis and forward head posture were again quantified and compared to the initial radiographs. Results The average overall decrease in forward head posture among all subjects was 0.83 inches. The largest reduction in forward head posture was 1.25 inches. One subject failed to show any reduction. The largest and smallest improvements in the cervical lordosis were 23° and 4°, respectively. The average increase in cervical lordosis for all subjects was 9.9°. Conclusions This specific protocol was able to provide measurable improvement in cervical lordosis and reduction of forward head posture after only 1 session. However, it is not known which component, the spinal manipulation or the anterior headweighting, made the biggest impact. This study shows the immediate effects of spinal manipulation and headweighting combined. Future research should focus on the headweighting effects over a longer period of time. Additionally, anterior headweighting alone needs to be tested to evaluate its effectiveness as a sole treatment intervention. "
"Objective To discuss the case of a patient with myofascial pain syndrome that appeared similar to double crush syndrome. Clinical Features This is a case report of a 45-year old female who presents to the private practice clinic with the same signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 1 year post-carpaltunnel surgery. The history is consistent with injuries that result in double crush syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome. The patient history includes a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in 1963 that resulted in a prolonged hospital stay and fracture of a cervical vertebral (C4) body. She fractured the olecranon process of the right elbow during a fall in 1970's. She has smoked approximately 1 pack a day for 20 years. Her job involves long periods of sitting at a keyboard and in a car. All of these portions of the patient history are possible factors in the clinical signs and symptoms of double crush syndrome. Intervention and Outcome Treatment involved chiropractic manipulation and physical therapy modalities for the elimination of pain and returning the patient's full range of motion in the wrist, elbow, shoulder and cervical spine. After range of motion was restored, a home exercise program was initiated. The home exercise program included a return to past sporting activity and active, resistive (Theraciser band) activities for the elbow and cervical spine. Also a reduction in smoking was initiated as part of the patient's treatment plan. Conclusion It is our contention that patients who have electromyographic (EMG) demonstrable carpal tunnel syndrome need a cervical spine workup and a period of conservative care to include skilled manipulation, physical therapy and home exercises before surgery is recommended. "
"Objective To discuss the case of a patient whose lumbar disc derangement syndrome resolved after treatment that included McKenzie diagnosis and therapy, spinal mobilization, and spinal manipulation. Also, to give an overview of the McKenzie method in general, and more specifically for evaluation and management of derangement syndrome. Clinical Features The patient reported acute onset of left-sided low back pain and superior buttock pain while bending to tie her shoes. The most significant finding on initial McKenzie evaluation was that repetitive patient-generated left-side gliding movements greatly increased lumbar range of motion and decreased the buttock and low back pain, with the pain remaining better after completion of the movements. Intervention and Outcome The case was initially managed with instructions in patient-generated lateral side-gliding movements and spinal mobilization. After 5 treatment visits, the management was changed to patient-generated repetitive extension movements and spinal manipulation. The outcome was complete resolution as per Oswestry Low Back Pain and Disability Index and Visual Analog Scale, and complete resolution of symptoms except for mild pain with sitting over 2 hours. Conclusion This case demonstrated short-term resolution of acute low back pain and buttock pain with patient-generated forces, spinal mobilization and manipulation, and interferential electrical stimulation. McKenzie mechanical diagnosis and therapy may be a beneficial tool in the chiropractic practice. "

"Objective To describe the use of chiropractic rehabilitation, functional assessment methods, and outcome measures in treatment of a single case of chronic recurrent migraine headache. Clinical Features A 22-year-old woman had migraine, recurrent duration 2 years. She had no history of trauma and the symptoms persisted despite multiple medical interventions. She had head pain, primarily left frontal retro-orbital, accompanied by nausea and visual aura of “spots” when severe. Intervention and Outcome This subject was managed with rehabilitative exercises in combination with chiropractic manipulation. Outcome measures, including the Headache Disability Index, are described. Conclusion The chronic recurrent migraine resolved over a 12-week period with use of chiropractic rehabilitation in this patient. More research is necessary to determine whether this approach is consistently reproducible and how it compares with spinal manipulation alone and other forms of treatment. Further investigation of combining rehabilitation with chiropractic manipulation for some migraine patients should be considered. "
"Medical iatrogenesis is at an all-time high with increasing deaths, disability, and costs compounded by unnecessary and ineffective surgeries despite the warnings from WHO, the US Public Health Service, and the Institute of Medicine. One area in particular, failed back surgeries, has drawn increasing attention by researchers due to disproved medical theories and surgical treatments. Paradoxically, while spinal manipulative therapy has been shown to achieve better results for this epidemic of low back pain in particular, medical and insurance programs often limit or boycott this inexpensive and effective treatment, indicating the solution to lowering medical costs and iatrogenesis now rests with political and economic factors primarily. "
"Objective To discuss the general diagnostic and therapeutic considerations involved in managing patients with shoulder injury. Data Sources Medline search going back 10 years, and using the key terms “throwing” and “shoulder injuries.” Data Synthesis Papers which evaluated current treatment protocols as determined by previously published papers in peer reviewed journals or textbooks that had no confounding variables were examined. Results The throwing motion is a complex maneuver which requires coordination of a variety of structures. Depending upon the specific kind of injury, rehabilitation may involve numerous different approaches. A 4-phase rehabilitation program is described. Conclusion Synthesis of the literature regarding management of throwing injuries is described. "

"Asthma is a multifactorial dysfunction of the respiratory system. Nutritional, environmental, genetic, and emotional factors all play animportant part in the etiology of this condition. One form of chiropractic, Sacro Occipital Technique (SOT), offers some conservative alternatives to the treatment of asthma. SOT expands the chiropractic armamentarium of techniques available, allowing methods putatively affecting the viscera, vertebra, post and preganglionic reflexes, as well as cranial and sacral influences on the primary respiratory mechanism. Though more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of chiropractic care of asthma, the conservative nature of chiropractic care with its minimal side effects, warrants patient and a health practitioner's consideration prior to embarking on any course of treatment that might have serious side effects. "
"Objective To review the literature assessing current trends within primary health care and its delivery and the role of the chiropractic primary care physician. Data Sources Select papers which offer definitions of primary care. Data Synthesis Several influential papers offer criteria necessary to be considered primary care practitioners. Results Primary care is comprehensive, coordinated, continuous and accessible. Chiropractic care meets this definition. Conclusion The primary care chiropractic physician is a viable and important part of the primary health care delivery system, with many chiropractic physicians currently prepared to participate effectively and competently in primary care. "
"Objectives To assess the efficacy of spinal manipulation versus ultrasound in the treatment of patients with neck pain. Design Randomized clinical trial. Setting Technikon Natal Chiropractic Clinic—Durban, South Africa Subjects Thirty randomly allocated subjects with neck pain, (aged between 16 and 60 years), responded to advertisements from the “college” (Technikon Natal, Department of Chiropractic), in the local newspapers and from the radio. Method Two groups of subjects were treated. Group 1 received spinal manipulation and Group 2 received ultrasound. Both groups were assessed with a CROM goniometer used for cervical range of motion assessments, algometer measurements (to assess pain thresholds), completion of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale 101 (for intensity of pain), level of disability using the CMCC Neck Disability Index, and the Short Form McGill Questionnaire to assess for the sensory dimension of pain. Results Ultrasound increased only right rotation range of motion of the neck, whereas spinal manipulation increased left rotation, right lateral flexion (ranges of motion of the neck) and decreased disability. Conclusion From the results it appears that both ultrasound and adjustments are useful in treating mechanical neck pain; however, it appears that adjustments were more effective in restoring overall mobility and in decreasing cervical disability than ultrasound alone.

"Objective This review was conducted to analyze the law for the practice of chiropractic throughout the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to determine the legal ability of the Doctor of Chiropractic in each jurisdiction to provide primary care service as described by the 1996 Institute of Medicine Definition of Primary Care. Method The practice acts for each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were reviewed for language that would permit the chiropractic doctor to meet the 9 criteria of primary care practice described by the Institute of Medicine. Forty-four practice acts were cross referenced with the results of a scope of practice survey of State Boards of Chiropractic in 1999. Results The review of the practice acts and the survey on chiropractic scope of practice revealed a varied degree of chiropractic scope of practice with 23 of 53 of the jurisdictions limiting the ability of the chiropractic doctor to fully provide IOM defined primary care. Conclusion The varied practice act definitions for chiropractic practice throughout the United States the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands reveal an inability of the chiropractic profession to respond to a call for a standard nationally-based primary-care policy that could be readily achieved by all chiropractic practitioners throughout the Union. This void of primary-care qualification in many State and Commonwealth practice acts will need to be addressed by the leaders of the profession if government entities and national third party organizations are to utilize chiropractic health care services to the standard of chiropractic education and clinical experience. The need for a broad range chiropractic scope of practice model practice act is suggested. "

"Background Although traditionally cancer has been fought with the usual armamentarium of chemotherapy and high doses of directed radiation, lately there has been more attention devoted to combating cancer through nutritive means. In particular, certain phytochemicals including some vitamins, some minerals and a wide range of other bioactive nutrients have been found useful in the physiological battle against cancer. Objective The objective of this article is to determine which vitamins, minerals and bioactive nutrients may be useful in combating cancer and to give therapeutic dosages of such when known. Data Synthesis The scientific literature is replete with research documenting the link between certain nutritional protocols and inhibition or protection against the disease of cancer. From the landmark article entitled The Causes of Cancer by Richard Doll and Richard Peto which was first commissioned as a report to the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress to the American Cancer Societys Advisory Committee Guidelines on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer Prevention: Reducing the Risk of Cancer with Health Food Choices and Physical Activity, the nutritional literature continues to provide the necessary link for the clinician to justifiably advise patients regarding proper dietary habits in order reduce the patients risk of cancer. Results Although there has been much research regarding the relationship between vitamins, minerals and other bioactive phytonutrients and cancer and protection against cancer, not all of the literature supports a strong and convincing link between the nutrient and cancer protection. This article differentiates the convincing evidence vs. the probable and the possible evidence of the link between the nutrient and its inhibitive effect on cancer. Conclusion Certain vitamins, minerals and bioactive phytonutrients can be used as a first line of therapeutic defense against cancer before chemotherapy and radiation treatment is commenced. "
"Objective To describe a novel orthopedic test (Polk's test) which can assist the clinician in differentiating between me- dial and lateral epicondylitis, 2 of the most common causes of elbow pain. This test has not been previously described in the literature. Clinical Features The testing procedure described in this paper is easy to learn, simple to perform and may provide the clinician with a quick and effective method of differentiating between lateral and medial epicondylitis. The test also helps to elucidate normal activities of daily living that the patient may unknowingly be performing on a repetitive basis that are hindering recovery. The results of this simple test allow the clinician to make immediate lifestyle recommendations to the patient that should improve and hasten the response to subsequent treatment. It may be used in conjunction with other orthopedic testing procedures, as it correlates well with other clinical tests for assessing epicondylitis. Conclusion The use of Polk's Test may help the clinician to diagnostically differentiate between lateral and medial epicondylitis, as well as supply information relative to choosing proper instructions for the patient to follow as part of their treatment program. Further research, performed in an academic setting, should prove helpful in more thoroughly evaluating the merits of this test. In the meantime, clinical experience over the years suggests that the practicing physician should find a great deal of clinical utility in utilizing this simple, yet effective, diagnostic procedure.

"Objective To demonstrate the benefits of reducing forward head posture and restoring the cervical lordosis as a novel approach to treating a patient with mechanical thoracic pain. Clinical Features The patient had thoracolumbar junction pain bilaterally that failed to respond to previous sessions of spinal manipulative therapy. Treatment included both manipulative and rehabilitative procedures designed to correct the forward head posture and cervical kyphosis. Treatment progress was quantified on pre and post lateral cervical radio-graphs. Intervention and Outcome The treatment plan was 30 sessions over an 8-week period that included spinal manipulative therapy, used in concert with a new headweight device applied immediately after the manipulation was performed at each session. The patient was also instructed on the performance of certain rehabilitative procedures to be performed in the home setting. The patient experienced significant symptomatic relief after the 3rd week of care. The cervical lordosis was restored by 144% and the forward head posture was decreased by 56% at the end of the trial period. Conclusion Restoration of the cervical curve and reduction of forward head posture appears to have beneficial effects beyond the cervical spine. The addition of active rehabilitative procedures seems to enhance the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy in the correction of forward head posture and cervical kyphosis. "
"Background The efficiency and efficacy of the chiropractic consultation would be enhanced if patients requiring additional psychological assistance could be identified. Distressed patients and those with a low sense of coherence and/or manageability score may benefit from a more prolonged chiropractic consultation or may require specialist referral. Objective This exploratory study sought to ascertain whether categorization within a particular chiropractic management group could serve as a red flag to alert the practitioner to the likelihood of special patient needs. Research Method A case study to explore the psychological profile of chiropractic patients was undertaken. The DRAM (Distress and Risk Assessment Method) and SOC (Sense of Coherence) questionnaires were used to ascertain the distress and sense of coherence and manageability levels of acute, chronic and maintenance chiropractic patients. Purposive sampling of practitioners and convenience sampling of patients fulfilling the study's inclusion criteria was undertaken. Patients were requested to complete two and chiropractors to complete one questionnaire and an interview. Results Ten chiropractors and 142 patients participated in the study. Of participating patients, 38% had a chronic biomechanical problem, 23% were acute, and 39% were maintenance patients. Acute, chronic and maintenance patients were spread along the entire spectrum of the SOC and manageability scale. Of the 130 patients who completed the DRAM section of the questionnaire, over one in five were distressed. Conclusion Due to the small sample size and the diversity of results it was not possible to identify particular groups of chiropractic patients who require additional consultation time or referral. This study did however demonstrate that some chiropractic patients are distressed and consequently it is important that chiropractors know when to manage and when to refer anxious or depressed patients.

"Objective To describe the components of female athlete triad, the proposed mechanisms that may relate to its causation, and some screening and treatment options that may be used by the clinician who encounters this clinical entity in patients. Data Sources A qualitative review of the literature was performed. Results This article provides the clinician with current information relevant to understanding and recognizing female athlete triad in at-risk patients. The components of the triad—amenorrhea, disordered eating, and osteoporosis—are interrelated in multifactorial etiology, pathogenesis, and consequences. Proposed causal factors include inadequate nutrition, menstrual status, training intensity and frequency, body size and composition, and psychological and physiological stress. There should be a high index of suspicion in all females athletes for the presence of and/or increased risk for female athlete triad. An increased awareness of the existence of the problem and its presenting signs and symptoms is the key to screening for this syndrome. The most efficacious treatment lies in its prevention. Conclusions Female athlete triad is an interrelated, multifactorial syndrome comprised of disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. It is a common entity among female athletes. Prevention, early detection, and early treatment are absolutely essential to maintain the athletes health into maturity and to prevent the serious consequences of this triad. The long-term effects of some triad components are still unknown. "

"Objective Self-care is becoming an important objective for achieving a sustainable health care system. This study examines the health care initiatives of chiropractic patients ascertaining their self-care behaviors, knowledge and information sources. Sample Convenience sampling of chiropractic patients attending 10 chiropractors in 3 states. Of 155 patients invited to participate, 147 agreed. Method Patients were interviewed to determine their smoking, alcohol, maintenance chiropractic care, exercise and nutritional supplementation practices. Data collection included dose/frequency of the activity, expected benefits, concerns about side-effects and sources of information. Data was collated and trends identified. Results Overall, the chiropractic patient sample reported a healthy lifestyle. Seventy-four percent (74%) had maintenance chiropractic; 69%, regular exercise; 40%, nutritional supplements; 84%, were non-smokers; and 86% were teetotallers or drank alcohol within safe limits. Few displayed appreciation of possible side-effects or ‘dose-response’ relationships. Lay persons were important information sources. Conclusion Chiropractic patients' self-care behaviors could be refined by making them more aware of the protean effects of self-care initiatives. "

"Introduction Dural port therapy (DPT) is a chiropractic procedure which can be used effectively with Sacro-Occipital Technique (SOT) procedures and which uses the sacrum as a lever to influence and balance the spine and cranium by way of the meningeal system. Discussion Rationale and research is presented to explain the basis behind DPT's method of affecting the craniospinal system and its relationship to the meninges. Though the procedure can be used with most conditions, DPT appears to be safe to use with osteoporotic conditions, fractured vertebrae, and other conditions where a “thrust” to the spine may be contraindicated. Basic methods of using DPT are presented along with alternative methods which can be applied when the basic methods are not sufficient. Conclusion DPT reduces sacral, spinal, and cranial dura meningeal tension, lesions, torque and stress, as well as dural sleeve vasomotor interference. The possibility that the doctor can influence the nervous system directly in such a powerful manner warrants further investigation. "

"Headaches represent symptom collections reflecting various mechanisms. True pathology causing headache is comparatively rare and therefore headache symptoms generally reflect functional disturbances. Models of headache pathogenesis may lead to therapeutic interventions, or be extrapolated from successful therapeutic interventions. These can provide a basis for research and case management. If we consider symptom expression as a manifestation of a threshold response and headache sufferers as a population with lowered threshold, therapeutic approaches may be oriented to changing the thresholds. Headache symptoms may also represent the sensitivity to other triggers, which make it easier to reach a similar symptom threshold. Treatment would then be oriented to changing the response to the triggers. This paper presents models of manual therapies related to headache treatment and discusses research directions, relation to medical models of headache and a discussion of clinical considerations for treatment. Since individuals with headaches may represent a broad spectrum of etiologies, these models may be utilized in developing and fine-tuning individual programs of treatment as well as guiding future research. Manual therapies have significant potential relative to managing headaches. There are differences in application and technique that may be considered when approaching individual presentations. Understanding the mechanisms behind different models may provide a basis for fine-tuning therapeutic algorithms for individual presentations. "
"AbstractThe ""ambiance"" of a space has an effect on people using the space. In recent years, design for health care environments has begun to include esthetic enhancements in an attempt to reduce stress and anxiety, increase patient satisfaction, and promote health and healing. In this paper, the authors survey the existing research on those elements of the built and natural environment most often asserted by proponents as being inherently healing or promoting health. We postulate a hierarchy of effect of environmental elements ranging from simply nontoxic to safe (both physically and psychologically) to ""providing a positive context"" to being actively salutogenic. Most relevant research has been concentrated on a limited number of settings and is inadequate to inform the creation of design guidelines for the physical elements of an optimal healing environment. Opportunities exist to make meaningful contributions in this area that are likely to make a significant impact on health outcomes of human beings."
"AbstractBackground: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic upper respiratory disease affecting 10–30% of the population worldwide. It associated with significant economic and medical burden. Probiotics have received attention in recent years as a novel strategy to treat infectious/immune conditions, including AR. However, substantiation of these health claims by regulatory bodies has been rejected due, in part, to inadequate clinical trial design. While randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for assessing clinical efficacy, such trials require a priori preclinical data on effect size, which may be a reason for the conflicting results in the probiotic and AR literature. Progressive clinical trial designs, such as the Simon Two-Stage Design, are showing promise within the area of integrative and alternative medicine, particularly in relation to probiotic supplementation, to obtain empirical data for the design of clinical trials that meet regulatory requirements.Methods: This Phase II study uses a Simon Two-Stage Design to determine the response rate of patients with AR to a probiotic supplement. Patients will consume a multispecies probiotic twice daily for 8 weeks, and will attend an allergy clinic at the beginning and end of the intervention period for assessment. Symptom improvement following probiotic supplementation will be measured by the mini-Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include twice-weekly symptom and medication diaries, objective determination of nasal congestion via Nasal Rhinomanometry, and change in frequency of medication usage.Discussion: This study provides an exemplar of the value of using a progressive study design in the complementary and alternative medicine setting. A Simon Two-Stage Design was adopted to investigate whether a multispecies probiotic supplement, not yet trialed in the context of AR, has promise as a therapeutic intervention and warrants the design of larger placebo-controlled studies."
"AbstractStudy of complementary and alternative medicine's mind and body interventions (CAM-MABI) is hindered not only by the inability to mask participants and their teachers to the study intervention but also by the major practical hurdles of long-term study of practices that can be lifelong. Two other important methodological problems are that study of newly trained practitioners cannot directly address long-term practice, and that long-term practitioners likely self-select in ways that make finding appropriate controls (or a comparison group) challenging. The temporary practice pause then resumption study design (TPPR) introduced here is a new tool that extends the withdrawal study design, established in the field of drug evaluation, to the field of CAM-MABI. With the exception of the inability to mask, TPPR can address the other methodological problems noted above. Of great interest to investigators will likely be measures in practitioners of CAM-MABI that change with temporary pausing of CAM-MABI practice, followed by return of the measures to pre-pause levels with resumption of practice; this would suggest a link of the practice to measured changes. Such findings using this tool may enhance our insight into fundamental biological processes, leading to beneficial practical applications."
"AbstractBackground: Interpretation of the efficacy of reflexology is hindered by inconsistent research designs and complicated by professional views that criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)are not ideal to research holistic complementary and alternative medicine practice. The influence of research designs on study outcomes is not known. This integrative review sought to evaluate this possibility.Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven interventional studies (2000–2014) were identified; they had RCT or non-RCT design and compared reflexology outcomes against a control/comparison group. Viability of integrating RCT and non-RCT studies into a single database was first evaluated by appraisal of 16 reporting fields related to study setting and objectives, sample demographics, methodologic design, and treatment fidelity and assessment against Jadad score quality criteria for RCTs. For appraisal, the database was stratified into RCT/non-RCT or Jadad score of 3 or more or less than 3. Deficits in reporting were identified for blind assignment of participants, dropout/completion rate, and School of Reflexology. For comparison purposes, these fields were excluded from subsequent analysis for evidence of association between design fields and of fields with study outcomes.Results: Thirty-one studies applied psychometric tools and 20 applied biometric tools (14 applied both). A total of 116 measures were used. Type of measure was associated with study objectives (p < 0.001; chi-square), in particular of psychometric measures with a collated “behavioral/cognitive” objective. Significant outcomes were more likely (p < 0.001; chi-square) for psychometric than for biometric measures. Neither type of outcome was associated with choice of RCT or non-RCT method, but psychometric responses were associated (p = 0.007) with a nonmassage control strategy.Conclusions: The review supports psychometric responses to reflexology when study design uses a nonmassage control strategy. Findings suggest that an evaluation of outcomes against sham reflexology massage and other forms of massage, as well as a narrower focus of study objective, may clarify whether there is a relationship between study design and efficacy of reflexology."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this article is to present the rationale, study design, and methods of an ongoing randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of an energy psychology intervention, Tapas Acupressure Technique® (TAT®), to prevent weight regain following successful weight loss.Design: This is a randomized controlled trial.Settings/location: The study is being conducted at a large group-model health maintenance organization (HMO).Subjects: The study subjects are adult members of an HMO.Interventions: TAT is being compared to a self-directed social support comparison intervention.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is weight-loss maintenance at 6 and 12 months postrandomization.Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of an energy psychology intervention, TAT, by comparing it with a self-directed social support group intervention. This is, to our knowledge, the largest randomized controlled study to date of an energy psychology intervention. Positive findings would support the use of TAT as a tool to prevent weight regain following successful weight loss."
"AbstractObjective: To design, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive Integrative Pain Management Program (IPMP) for patients with chronic pain in a safety-net primary care clinic.Design: We used a quality improvement “Plan Do Study Act” (PDSA) framework to design, refine, and evaluate an integrative chronic pain program.Setting: An urban federally qualified health center located in a community with high rates of chronic pain, substance use, and opioid overdose.Subjects: Eligible participants included individuals with pain for greater than 3 months who were prescribed opioid therapy.Outcome measures: We designed IPMP using a PDSA framework that promotes continuous evaluation and adaptation of the program to meet the needs of the clinical system. We assessed feasibility and acceptability with program referrals and attendance and evaluated program satisfaction.Results: The IPMP delivered a 12-week group-based intervention that involved group support, education on pain etiology and treatments, movement-based interventions, mindfulness-based therapies, acupuncture, and massage therapy. One hundred forty-six patients were referred to IPMP; 58 individuals participated in one of the first three cohorts of the program. Sixty-two percent of participants attended at least half of the sessions. Staff and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with IPMP and demand for longitudinal services.Conclusions: An IPMP delivered within a safety-net primary care clinic could be implemented in a way feasible and acceptable to staff and participants with the support of the local health care system. The application of a PDSA cycle allowed for rigorous implementation and evaluation of a multimodal pain program. Quality improvement frameworks are a strategy to improve and expand the delivery of high-quality patient-centered integrative pain treatments."
"AbstractObjectives: To describe the importance and process of gathering the perspectives of former patients when designing clinical studies for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies and          to describe how this information was used to guide the planning of a clinical study using complementary modalities to reduce symptom distress and enhance quality of life during the autologous stem cell          transplantation (ASCT) process.Design: Structured interviews with former ASCT patients to identify preferences, opinions, and other issues that may affect a clinical study in this population.Setting: University of Virginia Health System Stem Cell Transplant Clinic.Subjects: Ten (10) patients who had undergone ASCT within the previous year.Results: In general,          the 10 study participants interviewed reported that they would have been more receptive to receiving gentle Swedish massage than using guided imagery tapes during the ASCT process, although neither modality          would have been particularly welcome during those treatment phases with highest physical or emotional/mental stress. Personal experiences, treatment side-effects, ""personality,"" and life situation all had          an influence on not only what was considered most stressful for the patient but also why it was perceived as stressful.Conclusion: Eliciting the views of persons who have undergone significant          medical events is a necessary step in rigorous clinical trial development aimed at testing the efficacy of CAM modalities for symptom management. Consideration of patient preferences and motivations may          ensure the best fit between interventions and the desired outcomes.      "
"AbstractBackground: The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines were developed in 1996 by researchers and journal editors to improve the quality of reporting of biomedical research by providing a standardized format for researchers to present information on randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). This improved data reporting allows readers to independently assess the quality and conclusions of these studies, and has been widely incorporated in contemporary research reports. In 2001, a supplemental set of criteria that specifically address the reporting of design and implementation issues for RCTs involving the use of acupuncture was introduced, termed the STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture) recommendations.The CONSORT guidelines are stated to be part of a broader effort to improve the quality of research, as they can be used by researchers to optimize the design of future trials. Similarly, the STRICTA recommendations outline research reporting standards that are and should be considered when designing controlled clinical trials that involve the use of acupuncture. The CONSORT and STRICTA recommendations thus not only serve to improve research reporting, but also serve to provide guidance for optimizing the designs of future clinical trials.Objectives: This paper presents a review of the STRICTA recommendations for reporting the results of controlled trials utilizing acupuncture, discusses their potential limitations, and offers suggestions for additions/enhancements to those standards based on research issued subsequent to the issuance of the STRICTA recommendations in 2001."
"AbstractAcupuncture has been incorporated as a treatment component in numerous addiction treatment programs in the United States; however, its efficacy has not been demonstrated in large-scale, controlled clinical trials. In this article we discuss the background and design of the Cocaine Alternative Treatments Study (CATS), a randomized, controlled, multisite study of acupuncture that will enroll 500 cocaine-dependent individuals at 6 sites across the country, and that constitutes the largest controlled trial for the treatment of cocaine addiction undertaken to date. After presenting the background of the study, we discuss the approach taken to address several critical issues, including the choice of appropriate control conditions, point location for needle insertion, degree of blinding, and bias checks. Complementary therapies are used by a significant number of individuals, and the need to evaluate them in controlled clinical trials is an ongoing and urgent issue."
"AbstractBackground and objective: This study investigates (1) whether treatment by homeopaths is more efficacious than self-selected conventional health care and (2) whether self-treatment with self-selected homeopathic medicines is more efficacious than placebo in preventing childhood upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).Design: A four-arm randomized controlled trial involving two independent investigations, one open and pragmatic (evaluating the effect of treatment by homeopaths including homeopathic medicines) and one doubleblinded (evaluating the effect of self-treatment with homeopathic medicine).Patients: The planned sample size is 420 children below the age of 10, recruited by a postal invitation to all children diagnosed with URTIs when attending a casualty department in Trondheim, Norway.Interventions: The children are randomly assigned to receive either (1) self-selected homeopathic medicine or placebo (270 patients), (2) treatment by one of four different homeopaths who could prescribe any homeopathic medicine (75 patients), or (3) waiting list control using self-selected conventional health care (75 patients).Main outcome measure: Total URTI symptom scores from patients' diary over 12 weeks.Plan: The results of these two studies (available at the end of 2004) have the potential to provide information about the efficacy of treatment by homeopaths independently from the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in children with URTIs."
"AbstractBackground: Probiotics are purported to reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis. This study sought to determine the proportion of participants with an improvement in the mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (mRQLQ) in response to a multispecies probiotic supplement with a Simon Two-Stage design.Methods: This study was based on a Simon Two-Stage Design for p1-p0 = 0.18 to account for seasonal variation in symptoms. Under this design, ≥10 patients are required to exhibit an improvement in quality-of-life scores to determine that there was sufficient activity for the supplement to be considered effective. Participants consumed a probiotic supplement (Ecologic® AllergyCare; probiotik®pur) twice daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was based on a change in mRQLQ scores following supplementation. Secondary outcomes include assessment of change in symptoms and medication usage with a twice-weekly symptom and medication diary, nasal congestion by rhinomanometry, and total serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE for Bermuda grass.Results: A total of 40 participants completed the study. A total of 25 participants (63%, 49–76%, p < 0.001; mean, 95% confidence interval, p-value) out of 40 participants had a clinically meaningful response to treatment based on assessment of mRQLQ. On average, mRQLQ scores changed from 2.83 ± 1.51 at baseline to 1.66 ± 1.36 at week 4 and 1. 38 ± 1.13 at week 8 (p < 0.01) (mean ± SD, p-value). Sum of individual symptom scores and overall symptom scores over the course of treatment was significantly reduced (p = 0.036 and p = 0.039, respectively). A moderate reduction in frequency of allergy-related medication use in the final 4 weeks of supplementation period was observed (52.5% weeks 0–4 to 41.4% weeks 4–8; average proportion of total diary responses, p = 0.085). The supplement was largely well tolerated by participants at the dose provided.Conclusions: The proportion of participants exhibiting improvement in quality-of-life metrics warrants continued investigation in the form of a phase III placebo-controlled trial."
"AbstractDespite wide use by the public, limited evidence is available for many complementary and integrative health (CIH) practices. Thus, clinical researchers knowledgeable about CIH disciplines are necessary to study the efficacy and effectiveness of CIH practices to benefit the public health. To partially address the need for clinical researchers versed in CIH, the authors of this study report the design of an interprofessional clinical research training program focused on CIH, the Building Research across Interdisciplinary Gaps (BRIDG) program, supported by a 5-year T90/R90 grant from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. The T90-supported arm of the program trains doctoral-level CIH providers in clinical research at the research-intensive University of Washington. The R90-supported arm of the program trains researchers with conventional backgrounds in the practices of CIH at the clinic-intensive National University of Natural Medicine. The “Translational Science Spectrum” provides a common conceptual framework for both programs. Specific program elements include: individualized didactic training in clinical research and CIH disciplines; placement with clinical research mentors; placement with clinical mentors in CIH disciplines; shared and independent research project development; and interdisciplinary experiences through seminars and retreats. Program evaluation includes annual completion of the Clinical Research Appraisal Inventory (CRAI), which queries confidence in research skills and methods and periodic evaluation of training elements using the Supplemental Kellogg Logic–World Health Organization model, which emphasizes relevance, adequacy, efficiency, effectiveness, process, impact, equity, and sustainability. The BRIDG program exemplifies a new standard in interprofessional clinical research training, made possible through strong collaboration between disparate research- and clinically intensive institutions."

"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the proposed manual placebo in terms of success in blinding patients to treatment group assignment and outcomes between the treatment groups.Design: Randomized controlled trial.Setting: A chiropractic college research clinic in the midwestern United States.Subjects: One hundred and eleven (111) individuals aged 18 years and over with subacute or chronic lowback pain.Interventions: The active treatment consisted of flexion-distraction chiropractic manipulation and trigger point therapy and the control treatment of sham manipulation and effleurage; both groups received eight treatments over a 3-week period. The application of prescribed ranges of biomechanical forces for each treatment was standardized using specialized computerized equipment. ""Nontreatment"" aspects of the clinical encounter were to be standardized across groups. A primary clinician blinded to treatment assignment provided interpersonal interactions and treating clinicians delivered treatments with a minimum of interaction.Outcome measures: The accuracy of the patient's perception of group assignment at visit 4 and the mean change in the Pain Disability Index (PDI) over the treatment period were the primary outcome variables.Results: Patients in the control group were more likely to perceive their treatment assignment accurately than those in the active group (78% versus 54%, respectively). Patients in both treatment groups improved on the PDI and the Roland-Morris Questionnaire; there were no significant differences in improvement between the groups. Age, gender, prior chiropractic experience and expectation of treatment at baseline had no effect on outcomes.Conclusions: Patients in the control group were not successfully blinded; however, patients' perceptions of treatment group assignment did not significantly affect outcomes. The clinically significant improvement in both groups, independent of patient or clinician expectations, suggests the presence of therapeutic factors common to both groups, other than biomechanical force. Further studies examining other aspects of the clinical encounter, considered separately from biomechanical force, are warranted before arbitrarily designating any intervention as a ""placebo."""
"AbstractObjective: To assess individual difference characteristics of subgroups of patients with fibromyalgia (FM) patients with respect to the decision to stay in or switch from randomly-assigned verum          or placebo treatment during an optional crossover phase of a double-blinded homeopathy study.Design: Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, optional crossover clinical trial.Participants:          Fifty-three (53) community-recruited patients with FM entered the optional crossover phase.Intervention: Two homeopaths jointly selected an individualized homeopathic remedy for all patients.          The pharmacy dispensed either verum LM remedy or indistinguishable placebo in accord with randomized assignment for 4 months and the patient's optional crossover decision for an additional 2 months.Outcome          measures: Patients completed a battery of baseline state/trait questionnaires, including mood, childhood neglect and abuse, and trait absorption. They rated global health (whole person-centered) and          tender point pain on physical examination (disease-specific) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.Results: Rates of optional crossover from verum to placebo or placebo to verum were comparable          (p = 0.6; 31%, and 41%, respectively). The switch subgroups had greater baseline psychologic issues (emotional neglect in placebo-switch; depression and anger in verum-switch). The verum-stay subgroup          scored highest on treatment helpfulness and included all six exceptional responders who fell, prior to crossover, into the top terciles for improvement in both global health and pain. Patients staying in          their randomly assigned groups, active or placebo (n = 34), scored significantly higher in trait absorption than did those who switched groups (n = 19).Conclusion: Individual difference          factors may predict better and poorer responders with FM to specific and nonspecific effects of homeopathic and placebo treatment.

"AbstractObjective: The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate how the component structure of a complex intervention (CI) can be efficiently exploited for study design and statistical analysis by using concepts of factorial designs. Many studies on CIs in complementary and alternative medicine exhibit the structure of factorial designs, where all possible combinations of the levels of two or more treatments occur together. In this contribution, the treatment arms of CI studies are explicitly viewed as factorial combinations of their components. Experimental design offers the general concept of identifiability of effects, that is, unique estimability of the components' effects from the observed data. For factorial designs, a simple cross table representation of the treatment arms can show the components or sums or interactions of components that are identifiable within a given study design. The question of identifiability arises particularly if some combinations of components are not observed (e.g., individualized homeopathic prescription without consultation). Study designs from published homeopathy studies are used for demonstration.Conclusions: CI studies should explicitly use an intervention's factorial component structure if it is inherent in the treatment arms being compared. In this way, investigators can avoid study designs from which the effects of interest cannot be uniquely estimated and improve the interpretation of estimated effects."
"AbstractAlthough a growing body of clinical research has begun to evaluate the efficacy and safety of t'ai chi as a therapeutic tool for a variety of health conditions, little attention has been devoted to evaluating “how” t'ai chi is scientifically studied, and the advantages or limitations of different methodological approaches. In a companion to this paper (Part I), we argued that t'ai chi is a complex, multicomponent intervention, which poses unique challenges regarding the distinction of specific versus nonspecific effects and limitations regarding the use of reductionistic research frameworks. In this second, companion paper, we discuss additional obstacles inherent in precisely defining the t'ai chi intervention in an experimental paradigm. These challenges include t'ai chi's pluralism, the concept of t'ai chi dosage, and long- versus short-term evaluations of t'ai chi's efficacy and safety. To address these challenges, and with a goal to provide complete and unbiased evidence, we propose a pluralistic methodological approach to clinical research that includes controlled randomized trials of fixed protocols, community-based pragmatic trials, cross-sectional studies of long-term practitioners, and studies that integrate qualitative methods."

"AbstractBackground: A previous case study showed that Guasha, an ancient manual therapeutic technique, could exert hepatoprotective effect in a human chronic active hepatitis B carrier (active-CHB) by modulating the liver enzymes, cytokines, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The present study serves as a control to the aforementioned case report. The controls were chronic inactive carriers (inactive-CHB) and noncarriers of hepatitis B (NCs). Besides showing a difference in biochemical markers between controls and the previously reported active-CHB case, the asymptomatic condition in both inactive- and active-CHB offers an excellent control for the patient's expectation about Guasha's efficacy. The purpose of this case study was to investigate whether hepatoprotective biochemical markers previously measured in active-CHB in response to Guasha were also present in controls.Participants and Methods: Four inactive-CHB and nine NC participants were included. Each participant received a 15-minute Guasha treatment. Blood samples were obtained immediately before Guasha (day 0) and after Guasha (days 2, 5, and 7). Biochemistry values for liver function, HO-1, and T-helper (Th) cytokines were determined from blood tests. Neither the participants nor the investigator who administered Guasha were aware of the blood test results until after all data were collected for all participants.Results: In both inactive-CHB and NC participants, liver function, serum HO-1, and Th1/Th2 cytokines did not significantly differ before and after Guasha.Conclusions: In contrast to results in active-CHB patients, Guasha did not induce any significant modulation of liver enzymes, HO-1, or cytokines in inactive-CHB and NC participants. The current results suggest that a Guasha-induced hepatoprotective effect depends on the inflammatory event or clinical stage of chronic hepatitis B. Because both active and inactive carriers were completely unaware of their liver status at the time of receiving Guasha, the research protocol is effective in discounting the model that attributes the Guasha therapeutic efficacy to a placebo effect due to participants' expectations."
"AbstractBackground: The efficacy of acupuncture treatment for chronic low-back pain has not been reliably proven because of a lack of good quality studies, leading to the necessity of developing the German          Acupuncture Trial for Chronic Low-Back Pain (GERAC-cLBP) study.Objective: The aim is to assess the effectiveness of traditional Chinese acupuncture for chronic low-back pain compared to sham          acupuncture and with a conventional standard therapy.Methods: This trial is a nationwide, multicenter, randomized, prospective, partially blinded study. The primary endpoint is the success rate          after 6 months. Success is defined as an improvement of 33% or more of three pain-related items on the Van-Korff Pain Score or an improvement of 12% or more in the disability measured by the Hanover Functional          Ability Questionnaire. Assessment of the effectiveness of the blinding of patients to the form of acupuncture they received will be conducted. All clinical endpoints are assessed centrally by blinded independent          observers. The sample size, with a total of 1062 patients to be enrolled, is based on power calculations. Independent central randomization, data collection, data processing, and statistical analyzis are          provided. Success rates will be tested for differences using two-sided Fisher exact tests. In the primary analysis, all tests will be carried out on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary          analyses will be conducted according to protocol approaches.Trial status: The pilot phase of the trial started in February 2002, the estimated duration of the study is 2.5 years. Enrollment          is anticipated to be completed in the winter of 2003.Conclusion: The GERAC-cLBP study is currently the world's largest controlled trial of the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for low-back          pain. It will contribute to the evaluation of efficacy by means of evidence based medicine.      "

"AbstractBackground: In the nationwide German Acupuncture Trials (GERAC), verum acupuncture, mirroring the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture style, was tested against sham acupuncture and guideline standard therapy for the entities classified in the West as chronic low back pain (LBP) and gonarthrosis (GON).Objective: The objective was to develop broadly consensual acupuncture and control protocols for the treatment of LBP and GON in the GERAC trials.Methodology: Extensive literature study and consultation with acupuncture experts were consulted. Personal interviews, both free and structured, e-mail discussions, and phone conferences were used as well. Results: Broadly consensual acupuncture protocols for LBP and GON for verum and invasive sham acupuncture were developed. They included semistandardized point combinations with clearly described point selection rules based on TCM acupuncture diagnosis. A procedure was developed to help ensure homogenous treatment quality in a large multicenter trial.Conclusions: With 1162 randomized patients for LBP and 1039 patients for GON, the GERAC study design allowed acupuncture to be tested in a naturalistic environment. The rigorous study design and large number of physician investigators guaranteed a high external validity for the results. The results will help determine the significance of Chinese acupuncture in the context of Western medicine for the treatment of LBP and GON."
"AbstractBackground: Previous reports have suggested that acupressure is effective in reducing pain and improving sleep quality; however, its effects on alertness have not been characterized.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether two different acupressure treatments have opposing effects on alertness in a full-day classroom setting.Design: This was a cross-over (two-treatments; three periods), single-blinded, randomized trial.Setting: The University of Michigan School of Public Health was the setting.Subjects: Students attending a course in clinical research design and statistical analysis at the University of Michigan participated in the study.Interventions and outcome measures: Blinded subjects were randomized to two acupressure treatment sequences: stimulation–relaxation–relaxation or relaxation–stimulation–stimulation. Acupressure treatments were self administered over 3 consecutive days. Pre- and post-treatment alertness scores were assessed each day using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS). Changes in the SSS score (afternoon – morning) were analyzed using a mixed regression model of fixed and random effects. Important factors that were expected to affect alertness, such as caffeine and previous night's sleep, were also assessed.Results: Baseline characteristics and protocol compliance were similar between the two sequences. Stimulation acupressure treatment yielded a 0.56-point greater difference in score on the SSS, corresponding to less fatigue, compared to the relaxation acupressure treatment (p = 0.019). Day of study (p = 0.004) and hours of overnight sleep (p = 0.042) also significantly affected the change in SSS scores. Incorporating participants' beliefs as to which treatment they received did not significantly alter the observed treatment effect.Conclusions: Acupressure at stimulation and relaxation points has differential effects on alertness in a classroom setting. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings and to determine whether stimulation and relaxation acupressure are equally effective in influencing alertness."
"AbstractComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly popular, despite the limited evidence of the efficacy and safety of some forms of CAM. Cancer patients often turn to CAM therapies for the relief of treatment- induced side-effects and comorbidities. Cancer-associated weight loss commonly results in decreased functional status, life expectancy, and quality of life. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with cancer cachexia, mainstream treatments do not sustain weight. Although nutritional supplements are commonly used, many of these have not been tested in clinical trials. The issues faced in dietary supplement research differ from those in pharmaceutical drug trials. These include problems with standardization, contamination, and compliance documentation. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fish oil supplementation for the treatment of cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients. The primary outcome measure will be lean body mass; secondary outcomes include functional status and quality of life. The methodology of the clinical trial is reviewed here and the unique problems faced by investigators in designing studies of dietary supplements are discussed."
"AbstractObjectives: This study was designed to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of self-practiced qigong for treatment of essential hypertension.Methods: Six major electronic databases were searched up to July 2006 to retrieve any potential randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of self-practiced qigong for essential hypertension reported in any language, with main outcome measures as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The quality of included studies were assessed with the Jadad Scale and a customized standard quality assessment scale.Results: Ninety-two (92) studies were identified. Nine (9) of these studies qualified for meta-analysis, comprising a total of 908 cases. Results were as follows: (1) The mean decrease of SBP in those practicing qigong was a 17.03 mm Hg reduction (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.53–22.52) compared with nonspecific intervention controls, but not superior to that in drug controls (1.19 mm Hg, 95% CI −5.40–7.79) and conventional exercise controls (−1.51 mm Hg, 95% CI −6.98–3.95). (2) Mean decrease of DBP in those practicing qigong was 9.98 mm Hg (95% CI 2.55–17.41) compared with nonspecific intervention controls, but not superior to that in drug controls (2.49 mm Hg, 95% CI −0.16–5.13) and conventional exercise controls (−1.59 mm Hg, 95% CI −4.91–1.74). (3) No obvious side effects were identified.Conclusions: Self-practiced qigong for less than 1 year is better in decreasing BP in patients with essential hypertension than in no-treatment controls, but is not superior to that in active controls. More methodologically strict studies are needed to prove real clinical benifits of qigong, and to explore its potential mechanism."
"AbstractThe concept of optimal healing environments (OHE) includes a variety of elements that require exploration, definition, measurement, and interpretation. One key element is the relationships between healer and patient/ client and between healers themselves. These complexities mean that models of OHE that include relationship dynamics as resources in the healing processes need information to help planning, execution and measurement. This paper examines aspects of a proposed model of optimal healing that utilizes relational dynamics as central to healing processes. The dynamics of relationships between healers and clients are critical to the effectiveness of healing as a process of transformation. Conscious examination of healers' emotional availability in relationship-centered care may be important in determining primary roles in delivering care."
"AbstractThe growing popularity of complementary medicine has been accompanied by a call for controlled clinical studies to examine the efficacy and validity of its various methods. The difficulties encountered          in applying the evaluation methods of conventional medicine to complementary medicine are the result of the different paradigms underlying these two methods of medicine, and the differences in the healing          process. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between these two approaches and to suggest a possibility to use conventional research methodology in clinical studies of classical homeopathy. Two methods          are described. One is the randomization into a placebo or a treatment group after an individual remedy is chosen for each patient. This method requires an experienced homeopath and is reproducible only          by the same homeopath in the same population. On the other hand, the expected success rate will be high. Another method is prescribing and treating according to so-called keynotes, a set of symptoms known          to respond to a particular remedy that must be present in a patient in order to elicit a reaction from the remedy. This method is more suitable to a conventional design of a clinical study and is reproducible          by anyone. Yet the expected success rate is much lower. Some general design issues that may have a particular impact on clinical trials of classical homeopathy are discussed, including the need for sufficiently          powered trials to detect relatively small effects, strategies to deal with patient preference and embracing the use of ""active-control"" pragmatic trial designs.

"AbstractObjectives: To introduce a conceptualized visual error matrix tool to overview the validity of evidence by taking Radix Sophorae flavescentis for chronic hepatitis B as an example and to propose recommendations for improving clinical trial design and evidence quality.Methods: The randomized clinical trials and reviews were collected during the conduct of a Cochrane systematic review. The authors used a visual error matrix tool to overview the evidence validity by looking at systematic, random, and design error risks. Systematic errors were measured by the type of evidence. Random errors were expressed by the standard error (SE). Design errors were assessed on the priority of outcome measures and the adequacy of nine design components. Three-dimensional error matrix on benefits and harms were then constructed.Results: The authors included 6 meta-analyses and 28 randomized clinical trials. In terms of systematic errors, all reviews were at critically low quality, and all included randomized trials were assessed at high risk of bias. On this systematic error level, they found that there was substantial risk of random errors regarding all-cause mortality (SE 0.36), moderate risk regarding serious adverse events (SE 0.22), substantial risk regarding nonserious adverse events (SE 0.35), and small to moderate risk regarding surrogate outcomes such as detectable hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) and detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA (SE 0.16 and 0.21). No study reported results on quality of life, hepatitis B-related mortality, and morbidity. The design error risks were mainly misuse of outcomes (14/34), inadequate selection of participants (5/34), inadequate description of intervention (11/34) and control (9/34), single-center setting (33/34), and unclear study objective regarding superiority, equivalence, or noninferiority.Conclusion: The current evidence on Radix S. flavescentis for chronic hepatitis B showed high risks of systematic errors, moderate or high risks of random errors, and high risks of design errors. These findings suggest that more randomized trials at minimum risks of all three errors are needed to assess the benefits and harms of Radix S. flavescentis for chronic hepatitis B. The visual error matrix tool provides an overview of the reliability of evidence and may assist in design and conduct of future randomized trials."
"AbstractTwo distinct positive outcomes are possible with Classical Acupuncture; resolution of the ""main complaint"" for which the patient is seeking treatment and unexpected resolution of health concerns for which the patient is not seeking treatment. Two clinical cases are presented to illustrate this phenomenon clearly. In both cases, the unexpected outcomes follow logically from the central therapeutic imperative of Oriental medicine; treatment of both the patient's root and branch.Research designs focused on single health conditions do little to reflect this central clinical reality. To highlight this problem, the two cases presented here are repositioned within the framework of research designs focused on single health conditions. It becomes clear that any eventual ""gold standard"" of acupuncture-appropriate research designs would reflect the full health care service provided by Classical Acupuncture. This, in turn, would ensure that health care policies based on research results would be appropriate to the realities of clinical acupuncture."
"AbstractWhen multiple treatment choices are available, the question is not just “which treatment is the best?— but more importantly “best or better for whom, when, and why?— Aptitude (or attribute) by treatment interaction (ATI) is a research paradigm that attempts to examine exactly that—how outcome depends on the match or mismatch between patients’ specific characteristics and the treatments they receive. The purpose of this two-part paper is to introduce ATI methods as a conceptual framework into complementary and Alternative medicine/integrative medicine (CAM/IM) outcome research. Part I presented key concepts in ATI research. Part II presents ATI research designs and discusses their applications to the examination of the relationships between individuals and therapies, and the illumination of the mechanisms that make therapies differentially effective. Based on this examination, we conclude that ATI research offers invaluable insights into the multifaceted package of care typically delivered in contemporary medicine and therefore should be included in the portfolio of all CAM/IM outcome research."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aims to investigate the impact of a therapeutic horse riding (HR) intervention and an audiovisual (AV) intervention comprising exposure to equine rhythm and motion on developmental parameters of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD).Design: The study design was a pretest/post-test.Settings/Location: The study took place in three locations across Ireland—St. Michael's Boys School in Mervue, Co Galway, The Hunt Museum in Limerick City, Co. Limerick, and Fettercairn Youth Horse Project in Tallaght, Co. Dublin.Subjects: Eighty-three children (6–14 years) with a primary diagnosis of DCD.Interventions: Children meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into three groups: HR, AV, and a control (C) group. Those in the intervention groups participated in eight 30 min HR lessons or AV screening sessions.Outcome measures: A Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI) measured signs of depression. A Childhood Behavior CheckList (CBCL) determined any behavioral and emotional problems, while a Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) assessed the presence and extent of any social impairment. A GAITRite system provided an overall Functional Ambulation Performance (FAP) score (an automatic accumulated score of gait parameters, including gait speed, symmetry, distance, cadence, tension, support, and velocity), which was used to evaluate gait improvements.Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a main effect of time on all variables. Bonferroni post hoc tests revealed that these effects were due to significant improvements in both HR and AV groups for CDI, CBCL, and SRS, and significant improvements in the HR group only for FAP.Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence to support the value of an equine AV perception intervention at improving developmental parameters in children with DCD and provides additional support for the benefits of therapeutic HR on social, emotional, behavioral, and gait variables in these children."
"AbstractObjectives: This study investigated subjective and physiologic responses of lying on a bed of nails (BN) called the Shakti-mat and of listening to relaxing instructions and music. The BN has 6210 sharp-edge 5-mm plastic nails about 5 mm apart.Design: Thirty-two (32) healthy participants went through four conditions in randomized orders combining BN and relaxing instructions.Results: The subjective pain ratings on the BN increased immediately and reached a peak within 30 seconds. The pain then subsided gradually, indicating a habituation effect. Self-rated relaxation increased over time in all conditions. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher, heart rate was slower, and there was more high-frequency power heart rate variability (HRV), and signs of increasing circulation in the back on the BN. The relaxation instruction especially affected breathing and the HRV-indices standard deviations of normal interbeat intervals and low-frequency power, both known to be responsive to slow breathing. There were no differences in saliva cortisol.Conclusions: Healthy participants habituated to the induced pain on the BN and were able to subjectively relax. When on a BN, signs of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity were observed. The pain may hypothetically have triggered a parasympathetic response."
"AbstractObjectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of the physical motion of a horse (riding therapy) combined with the audiovisual perception of this motion on a group of children with dyspraxia in terms of cognition, mood arousal, and gait variability.Design: The study design was a pretest/post-test.Settings/location: The study was conducted at the Fettercairn Youth Horse Project, Fettercairn, Tallaght, Dublin.Subjects: Forty (40) children ranging from 6 to 15 years of age with a primary diagnosis of dyspraxia were the study subjects.Interventions: Children meeting inclusion criteria participated in six 30-minute horse-riding sessions and two 30-minute audiovisual screening sessions.Outcome measures: A Standard Progressive Matrices test (also known as the Ravens test) was used to measure aspects of general intelligence. A Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI) questionnaire was used to assess cognitive, affective, and behavioral signs of depression. A GAITRite Pressure Mapping System analyzed foot function and gait variability by measuring single and double support, cycle time, cadence, toe in/out, and stride length.Results: Significant improvements were evident on the Ravens test and the CDI by the end of the study period. The amount of both single and double support required while completing the walking task also was significantly reduced. Improvements were visible on toe in/out values, cycle time, and cadence. Changes in stride length did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions: These findings support the theory that riding therapy and/or the perception of beat-based rhythms, as experienced by the rider on the horse, stimulates cognition, mood, and gait parameters. In addition, the data also pointed to the potential value of an audiovisual approach to equine therapy."
"AbstractObjectives: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is very popular in Switzerland. The objective of this work was to find out whether the use of CAM therapies is associated with distinct health characteristics and altered consumption of conventional medications.Design and participants: Self-reported data from the 2007 Swiss Health Survey were analyzed. Two groups of participants were defined and compared with each other: CAM users (those who had used CAM during the last 12 months, n=3333) and nonusers (those who stated they had not used CAM during the last 12 months, n=9821).Outcome measures: Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of CAM use and to address relevance and magnitude of the differences in medication consumption between CAM users and nonusers.Results: Comparatively lower body–mass index (BMI) values and migraine, arthritis, allergies, and depression were associated with increased probability of CAM use. Multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for the effects of relevant demographic factors, BMI, and perceived health status showed that CAM users consumed fewer medications for cardiovascular diseases—high blood pressure and high cholesterol (and, by trend, heart problems and diabetes)—than nonusers. On the other hand, their consumption of analgesics and medications for depression and for constipation (and, by trend, sedatives and soporifics), was higher than that of nonusers.Conclusions: Migraine, arthritis, depression, and constipation might lead patients to use CAM therapies and, in addition, to consume more of some conventional medications. Given the long intake period and considerable adverse effects of medications, the lower consumption of these agents for chronic cardiovascular problems by CAM users might be beneficial and deserves further investigations."
"AbstractBackground: Outcome assessment can support the therapeutic process by providing a way to track symptoms and functionality over time, providing insights to clinicians and patients, as well as offering a common language to discuss patient behavior/functioning.Objectives: In this article, we examine the patient-based outcome assessment (PBOA) instruments that have been used to determine outcomes in acupuncture clinical research and highlight measures that are feasible, practical, economical, reliable, valid, and responsive to clinical change. The aims of this review were to assess and identify the commonly available PBOA measures, describe a framework for identifying appropriate sets of measures, and address the challenges associated with these measures and acupuncture. Instruments were evaluated in terms of feasibility, practicality, economy, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to clinical change.Methods: This study was a systematic review. A total of 582 abstracts were reviewed using PubMed (from inception through April 2009).Results: A total of 582 citations were identified. After screening of title/abstract, 212 articles were excluded. From the remaining 370 citations, 258 manuscripts identified explicit PBOA; 112 abstracts did not include any PBOA. The five most common PBOA instruments identified were the Visual Analog Scale, Symptom Diary, Numerical Pain Rating Scales, SF-36, and depression scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory.Conclusions: The way a questionnaire or scale is administered can have an effect on the outcome. Also, developing and validating outcome measures can be costly and difficult. Therefore, reviewing the literature on existing measures before creating or modifying PBOA instruments can significantly reduce the burden of developing a new measure."
"AbstractBackground: The continuous threat of influenza pandemic, as well as the ongoing costs to human life and health care systems from yearly epidemics, create a continual need for progress in this area of public health. The diversity of available complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment options are well known to the CAM profession, but poorly understood and accepted in mainstream medicine. This situation comes as no surprise given conventional medicine's reliance on repeated, large-scale randomized controlled trials of standardized design to support evidence-based clinical use of influenza antiviral drugs. The relatively low volume of well-conducted clinical trials on the treatment of influenza with CAM therapies compared to the high availability of conventional antiviral drug trials magnifies this problem.Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide structured guidelines for future CAM influenza studies based on a thorough review of consistent and standard design elements present in the controlled-trial design of conventional antiviral influenza therapies.Results: A selection of high-quality, influenza antiviral controlled trials from the published literature is reviewed, and important design elements are extracted and summarized to show both the consistency and the flexibility within study design elements.Conclusions: The standardized elements from influenza antiviral trials can be considered and mirrored in future CAM studies. In this way, CAM therapies might be looked at on similar grounds as conventional medicines in terms of potential usefulness and benefit in the treatment of influenza."

"AbstractObjectives: Patients can have difficulties choosing acupuncturists in the United Kingdom because acupuncturists are not all subject to statutory regulation. Research has identified factors that influence patients' choice of general practitioner. However, how patients choose acupuncturists has not been studied. The aim was to investigate how patients choose acupuncturists and to identify which factors might influence this choice.Design: A mixed-methods design used an exploratory qualitative study followed by a quantitative study. The qualitative study explored patients' experiences of acupuncture. The quantitative vignette study investigated the impact of patient gender and practitioner factors (gender, training location, and qualifications) on choice of acupuncturist.Methods: In the qualitative study, 35 acupuncture patients (recruited through maximum variation sampling from seven clinics and the community) participated in semistructured interviews about their acupuncture experiences. In the quantitative study, 73 participants imagined wanting to consult an acupuncturist for back pain. They rated 8 fictional acupuncturists; ratings were analyzed using analysis of covariance.Results: Patients wanted qualified, personable acupuncturists and valued recommendations from trusted others. Without such recommendations, potential patients preferred female acupuncturists (F(1,69) = 4.504, p < 0.05) and those with medical qualifications (F(1,69) = 44.832, p < 0.01).Conclusions: The decision to consult a particular acupuncturist is not straightforward. Acupuncturists' trustworthiness and technical competence are important to (potential) patients; practitioner gender also influenced preferences. Patients need to be informed about proposals concerning statutory regulation in CAM and its implications; conventional practitioners might be able to better support their patients wanting to consult acupuncturists."
"AbstractObjectives: This research investigates the healing practices of modern Paganism using a randomized controlled trial. Paganism is a burgeoning belief system in the United Kingdom, within which healing is a key aspect. However, Pagan spell-casting practices have received little attention from distance healing researchers. This study aims to address this gap in the literature.Design: This study utilized a randomized, double-blind, delayed intervention design.Settings/Location: Research took place at the University of Northampton.Subjects: Forty-four participants (30 females, 14 males) were recruited using snowball sampling (mean age = 24.30; range = 18–55).Procedure: Participants were randomly allocated to either Group A or B. Participants made written requests to the practitioner about changes they would like to see in their lives and provided a photograph and personal item to be used during the intervention. Participants attended meetings once a week during which they would take part in a guided body scan meditation before completing a quality-of-life measure. Healing practices were conducted for Group A between weeks 1 and 2 and for Group B between weeks 2 and 3.Outcome Measure: Well-being was measured using the 26-item WHOQOL-BREF.Results: Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed a significant, positive change in general health from weeks 1 to 4 (F = 4.02, p = 0.025, η2 = 0.149). Separate analysis of variances of the four WHOQOL domains showed significant improvements across the study in the physical and psychologic domains only; there was no significant group difference on any of the outcomes.Conclusion: All participants showed an increase in health and well-being domains directly related to their spell requests. However, there are no group differences to suggest that the spell-casting intervention was responsible."
"AbstractObjectives: This study was aimed to compare the effectiveness of aromatherapy and acupressure massage intervention strategies on the sleep quality and quality of life (QOL) in career women.Design: The randomized controlled trial experimental design was used in the present study. One hundred and thirty-two career women (24–55 years) voluntarily participated in this study and they were randomly assigned to (1) placebo (distilled water), (2) lavender essential oil (Lavandula angustifolia), (3) blended essential oil (1:1:1 ratio of L. angustifolia, Salvia sclarea, and Origanum majorana), and (4) acupressure massage groups for a 4-week treatment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Short Form 36 Health Survey were used to evaluate the intervention effects at pre- and postintervention.Results: After a 4-week treatment, all experimental groups (blended essential oil, lavender essential oil, and acupressure massage) showed significant improvements in sleep quality and QOL (p < 0.05). Significantly greater improvement in QOL was observed in the participants with blended essential oil treatment compared with those with lavender essential oil (p < 0.05), and a significantly greater improvement in sleep quality was observed in the acupressure massage and blended essential oil groups compared with the lavender essential oil group (p < 0.05).Conclusions: The blended essential oil exhibited greater dual benefits on improving both QOL and sleep quality compared with the interventions of lavender essential oil and acupressure massage in career women. These results suggest that aromatherapy and acupressure massage improve the sleep and QOL and may serve as the optimal means for career women to improve their sleep and QOL."
"AbstractBackground: Subclinical hypothyroidism, a thyroid disorder without obvious symptoms of thyroid deficiency, occurs in 3%–8% of the global population. Ashwagandha [Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal], a traditional medicine in Ayurveda, is often prescribed for thyroid dysfunctions.Objective: This pilot study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ashwagandha root extract in subclinical hypothyroid patients.Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center placebo-controlled study was performed at Sudbhawana Hospital, Varanasi, India between May 2016 and September 2016. Fifty subjects with elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (4.5–10 μIU/L) aged between 18 and 50 were randomized in either treatment (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) groups for an 8-week treatment period.Interventions: Ashwagandha root extract (600 mg daily) or starch as placebo.Efficacy Variables: Serum TSH, serum triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) levels.Results: A total of four subjects (two from each group) withdrew their consent before the second visit. Eight weeks of treatment with ashwagandha improved serum TSH (p < 0.001), T3 (p = 0.0031), and T4 (p = 0.0096) levels significantly compared to placebo. Ashwagandha treatment effectively normalized the serum thyroid indices during the 8-week treatment period in a significant manner (time-effects: TSH [p < 0.001], T3 [p < 0.001], and T4 [p < 0.001]). Four subjects (8%) (ashwagandha: 1[4%]; Placebo: 3[12%]) out of 50 reported few mild and temporary adverse effects during this study.Conclusion: Treatment with ashwagandha may be beneficial for normalizing thyroid indices in subclinical hypothyroid patients."
"AbstractObjectives: This report provides an experimental protocol for a study designed to verify the effects of yoga exercise and a nutritional guidance program during pregnancy on several key pregnancy and birth outcomes among Japanese women.Design: This is a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.Setting/Location: This intervention will be carried out in a university hospital in Tokyo.Subjects: Healthy primiparous women will be recruited at 18–23 gestational weeks in the hospital. A total of 400 participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups in this trial, with 100 participants in each group—group with yoga exercise, with nutritional guidance, with both yoga and nutritional guidance, and with standard care alone, as the control group. Yoga exercise consists of yoga classes held at the hospital 3 or 5 days a month, duration 60 min, and home practice using a digital video disk, duration 30 or 60 min per session. We recommend participants do yoga at least 3 days a week for a total of 60 min per day. Nutritional guidance is based on individual dietary intake assessed using a brief-type diet history questionnaire.Results: The primary outcome is rate of pregnant women with adequate gestational weight gain. Secondary outcomes include physiologic and psychologic status assessed via biomarkers and health-related scales, dietary nutrition intake, and birth outcomes.Conclusions: This study shows the effects of a yoga exercise and nutritional intervention. If the intervention is found to be effective, our results will be useful for healthcare providers and pregnant women."
"AbstractObjectives: To investigate whether Holotropic Breathwork™ (HB; Grof Transpersonal Training, Mill Valley, CA) has any significance in the development of self-awareness.Design: A quasi-experiment design and multiple case studies. A single case design was replicated. The statistical design was a related within-subject and repeated-measures design (pre-during-post design).Setting/location: The study was conducted in Denmark.Participants: The participants (n = 20) were referred from Danish HB facilitators. Nine were novices and 11 had experience with HB.Intervention: Four HB sessions.Outcome measures: The novices (n = 9) underwent positive temperament changes and the experienced participants (n = 11) underwent positive changes in character. Overall, positive self-awareness changes were indicated; the participants' (n = 20) scores for persistence temperament, interpersonal problems, overly accommodating, intrusive/needy, and hostility were reduced. Changes in temperament were followed by changes in paranoid ideation scale, indicating a wary phase.Results: Participants (n = 20) experienced reductions in their persistence temperament scores. The pretest mean (mean ± standard deviation, 114.15 ± 16.884) decreased at post-test (110.40 ± 16.481; pre–during-test p = 0.046, pre–post-test p = 0.048, pre–post-test effect size [d] = 0.2). Temperament changes were followed by an increase in paranoid ideation; the pre-test mean (47.45 ± 8.88) at post-test had increased to a higher but normal score (51.55 ± 7.864; pre–during-test p = 0.0215, pre–post-test p = 0.021, pre–post-test d = 0.5). Pre-test hostility mean (50.50 ± 10.395) decreased at post-test (47.20 ± 9.001; p = 0.0185; d = 0.3). The Inventory of Interpersonal Problems total pre-test mean (59.05 ± 17.139) was decreased at post-test (54.8 ± 12.408; p = 0.044; d = 0.2). Overly accommodating pre-test mean (56.00 ± 12.303) was decreased at post-test (51.55 ± 7.797; p = 0.0085; d = 0.4). The intrusive/needy pre-test score (57.25 ± 13.329) was decreased at post-test (52.85 ± 10.429; p = 0.005; d = 0.4).Conclusions: The theoretical conclusion is that HB can induce very beneficial temperament changes, which can have positive effects on development of character, measured as an increase in self-awareness."
"AbstractBackground: The diagnostic framework and clinical reasoning process of Chinese medicine are central to the practice of acupuncture and other related disciplines. There is growing interest in integrating it into clinical trials of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine to guide individualized treatment protocols and evaluate outcomes. Strategies that enhance diagnostic reliability may contribute to this integration.Objectives: (1) To evaluate inter-rater reliability among practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) when assessing women with dysmenorrhea using a structured assessment questionnaire (Traditional East Asian Medicine Structure Interview [TEAMSI]-TCM) compared to using a TCM questionnaire from routine clinical practice, not developed for research purposes (CONTROL); and (2) To evaluate the impact of training in the use of each approach on reliability.Design: Thirty-eight acupuncturists were asked to complete assessments of 10 subjects based on the viewing of a videotape of the initial assessment interview, a picture of the tongue, and a description of the pulse. Acupuncturists were randomized into one of four groups comparing the use of two questionnaires, TEAMSI-TCM versus CONTROL, and comparing training in the use of each versus no training.Analysis: The authors used Cohen's kappa to estimate agreement on TCM diagnostic categories relevant to dysmenorrhea between 2 practitioners with respect to questionnaires and training over all 10 patients and all 10 TCM diagnostic categories. For all analyses, the authors estimated kappa values for questionnaire, training, and experience level. Analysis of variance was used to test agreement among various groupings.Results: Regardless of the questionnaire used or training, analysis of inter-rater reliability indicated overall agreement to be low among practitioners (median 0.26). Kappa varied slightly by questionnaire and training, among 38 practitioners, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.227 and p = 0.126, respectively).Conclusions: A structured assessment interview instrument designed for research purposes with or without training did not significantly improve reliability of TCM diagnosis of dysmenorrhea compared to a commonly used instrument. Challenges in assessing reliability in TCM remain."
"AbstractObjective: Smoking cessation studies tailored for low-income and racial/ethnic minority cancer patients are limited. African American and low-socioeconomic status (SES) smokers have higher cancer mortality rates and are less likely to use evidence-based smoking cessation treatments compared with white and higher SES counterparts. Mindfulness training is a promising approach to address racial and SES disparities in smoking cessation. The authors assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation (MBSC) medical group visit for low-income and racially diverse smokers with cancer.Design and intervention: The authors adapted the integrative medical group visit model used for chronic pain and included the You Can Quit smoking cessation curriculum used at the study site, Tobacco Treatment Center. The program was conducted in eight weekly 2-h visits. The authors then tested the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention for actively smoking cancer patients and cancer survivors in two pilot groups (N = 18) using a pre–post design.Setting/Location: This study took place at Boston Medical Center, a large urban safety net academic teaching hospital.Outcome measures: The authors used a medical group visit intake form to collect data on weekly cigarette intake and home practice. They also gathered additional qualitative data from focus groups and in-depth interviews.Results: Over 50% of participants (n = 10) self-identified as black and 56% reported an annual income of $20,000 or less. Over two-thirds of the participants attended four or more of the eight group visits. There was a significant decrease in weekly cigarette intake from 75.1 cigarettes at baseline to 44.3 at 3 months (p = 0.039). None of the participants quit smoking. Participants were satisfied with the program and reported positive lifestyle changes.Conclusion: MBSC group visits are feasible and acceptable among racially diverse and low-SES smokers with cancer and should be further studied in a larger cohort."
"AbstractSystematic reviews suggest that homeopathy has a greater effect than placebo, however, the mechanisms of its action are unknown. The clinical effects of homeopathy could be attributed to the specific effects of the remedy and/or to the contextual effects of the consultation process;  these factors have not been critically evaluated. We have developed a model that attempt to separate the consultation effects from the specific effects because of the remedy. We propose to investigate this design in a chronic condition, rheumatoid arthritis, for which previous research has  evaluated both classical and complex homeopathic interventions. The following protocol describes the study design. The aims of this exploratory trial are to assess the feasibility of the study design, identify effect sizes of the consultation, the complex treatment, and the individualized  remedy, as well as possibly efficacy, for the two types of homeopathic treatment and the homeopathic consultation. Data collection will take place in 2004."
"AbstractObjective: To investigate whether the frequency of the practice of each of diet, art, and biofield therapy influences improvement in quality of life (QOL), and to examine whether the simultaneous practice of all three components increasingly improves QOL in a real-world setting.Design: Pre–post-test design using convenience sampling methods.Setting: Home setting.Subjects: A total of 4681 individuals aged 16 years or older who answered the questionnaire appropriately.Intervention: Participants agreed to practice the three components daily and self-evaluated the frequency of their weekly practice for three consecutive months. At the beginning and end of the study, they completed the MOA quality-of-life questionnaire (10-item MOA quality-of-life questionnaire [MQL-10]).Outcome measures: Factors associated with the increase in MQL-10 scores for each component, and the relationship between the simultaneous practice of multiple components and the changes in MQL-10 scores were analyzed.Results: Frequent practice of the diet and/or art components was associated with an increase in the term-end MQL-10 score (p < 0.001); however, receiving biofield therapy frequently was not. Participants' age, gender, and qualification as a practitioner of biofield therapy had no relationship with changes in scores, but the reasons for participation had a significant influence on changes in scores (p < 0.001). Participants who initially did not practice any components frequently but who subsequently increased the number of components and frequency of each practice had a higher likelihood of exhibiting an increase in the term-end score (p < 0.01). Participants who initially practiced all three components frequently but later decreased the number of components practiced frequently had a lower chance of increase and a higher risk of decrease in scores (p < 0.01).Conclusions: The data suggest that the frequent practice of the diet and art components is associated with improvement in QOL. Simultaneous practice of diet, art, and biofield therapy is more likely to improve QOL. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01927250)"
"AbstractObjectives: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an Ayurveda/Yoga intervention for weight loss, using dual-diagnosis inclusion criteria, dual-paradigm outcomes, and a semistandardized protocol with tailoring according to the Ayurvedic constitution/imbalance profile of each participant.Design: Seventeen participants enrolled in a weekly intervention for 3 months. Outcome measurements were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3 and 6 months follow-up.Setting: The intervention was conducted through the University of Arizona, Department of Family and Community Medicine from April through December 2012.Subjects: Participants included 2 men and 15 women recruited from the community of Tucson, AZ using flyers and hospital message boards. Seventeen enrolled and 12 participants provided complete follow-up data.Intervention: Participants met with an Ayurvedic practitioner twice monthly (six times) and followed semistandardized dietary guidelines with individual tailoring to address relevant psychophysiological imbalances obstructing weight loss and a standardized protocol of therapeutic yoga classes three times weekly with recommended home practice of two to four additional sessions.Outcome measures: Primary outcome was weight loss. Other biomedical outcomes included body mass index, body fat percentage, waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure. Unique instruments were designed to collect data on outcomes associated with the Ayurvedic medical paradigm, including dietary changes by food qualities, mood/affect, relationships, and changes in Ayurvedic imbalance profiles.Results: Participants lost an average of 3.5 kg during the 3-month intervention. Weight loss at 3 and 6 months postintervention increased to an average of 5.6 kg and 5.9 kg, respectively. Participants who lost 3% of their body weight during the 12 week intervention, lost on average an additional 3% during the follow-up period. Psychosocial outcomes also improved. No additional services were provided to participants during the follow-up period.Conclusions: A whole-systems Ayurvedic medicine and Yoga therapy approach provides a feasible promising noninvasive low-cost alternative to traditional weight loss interventions with potential added benefits associated with sustainable holistic lifestyle modification and positive psychosocial changes."
"AbstractObjectives: To investigate the effect on patient health status of an outpatient service providing acupuncture, osteopathy, and homeopathy. Design: Pragmatic quasiexperimental design with waiting-list          control group. Setting: A district general hospital in the United Kingdom. Subjects: All patients referred to the service during the study period. Outcome measures: The Short Form 36-Item          Health Status Survey (SF-36). Results: With the exception of the Physical Functioning scale, statistical differences in scores were found between the treatment and control group on all SF-36 scales.          Sensitivity analysis designed to deal with nonresponse supports the robustness of the results. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of an outpatient acupuncture, osteopathy          and homeopathy service in terms of benefits to patients' health status.      "
"AbstractObjectives: Chronic low back (CLBP) pain is prevalent among military veterans and often leads to functional limitations, psychologic symptoms, lower quality of life, and higher health care costs. An increasing proportion of U.S. veterans are women, and women veterans may have different health care needs than men veterans. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a yoga intervention on women and men with CLBP.Subjects/setting/intervention: VA patients with CLBP were referred by primary care providers to a clinical yoga program.Design: Research participants completed a brief battery of questionnaires before their first yoga class and again 10 weeks later in a single-group, pre–post study design.Outcome measures: Questionnaires included measures of pain (Pain Severity Scale), depression (CESD-10), energy/fatigue, and health-related quality of life (SF-12). Yoga attendance and home practice of yoga were also measured. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze group differences over time while controlling for baseline differences.Results: The 53 participants who completed both assessments had a mean age of 53 years, and were well educated, 41% nonwhite, 49% married, and had varying employment status. Women participants had significantly larger decreases in depression (p=0.046) and pain “on average” (p=0.050), and larger increases in energy (p=0.034) and SF-12 Mental Health (p=0.044) than men who participated. The groups did not differ significantly on yoga attendance or home practice of yoga.Conclusions: These results suggest that women veterans may benefit more than men veterans from yoga interventions for chronic back pain. Conclusions are tentative because of the small sample size and quasi-experimental study design. A more rigorous study is being designed to answer these research questions more definitively."
"AbstractBackground: Developing valid control groups that generate similar perceptions and expectations to experimental complementary and alternative (CAM) treatments can be challenging. The perceived credibility of treatment and outcome expectancy often contributes to positive clinical responses to CAM therapies, thereby confounding efficacy data. As part of a clinical feasibility study, credibility and expectancy data were obtained from subjects suffering from migraine who received either CranioSacral therapy (CST) or an attention-control, sham, and low-strength magnet (LSSM) intervention.Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the LSSM intervention generated similar levels of subject credibility and expectancy compared to CST.Design: This was a two-arm randomized controlled trial.Subjects: Sixty-five (65) adults with moderate to severe migraine were the subjects of this study.Interventions: After an 8-week baseline, subjects were randomized to eight weekly treatments of either CST (n=36) or LSSM (n=29). The latter involved the use of a magnet-treatment protocol using inactive and low-strength static magnets designed to mimic the CST protocol in terms of setting, visit timing, body positioning, and therapist–subject interaction.Outcome measures: A four-item, self-administered credibility/expectancy questionnaire, based on a validated instrument, was completed after the first visit.Results: Using a 0–9 rating scale, the mean score for perceived logicality of treatment was significantly less for LSSM (5.03, standard deviation [SD] 2.34) compared to CST (6.64, SD 2.19). Subject confidence that migraine would improve was greater for CST (5.94, SD 2.01) than for LSSM (4.9, SD 2.21), a difference that was not statistically significant. Significantly more subjects receiving CST (6.08, SD 2.27) would confidently recommend treatment to a friend than those receiving LSSM (4.69, SD 2.49).Conclusions: Although LSSM did not achieve a comparable level of credibility and expectancy to the CST, several design and implementation factors may have contributed to the disparity. Based on analysis of these factors, the design and implementation of a future study may be improved."
"AbstractObjective: To pilot an investigation of individualized homeopathy for symptoms of estrogen withdrawal in breast cancer survivors.Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.Setting: Outpatient department of a National Health Service (NHS) homeopathic hospital.Participants: Fifty-seven (57) women met inclusion criteria and 53 were randomized to the study.Intervention: After 2 weeks of baseline assessment, all participants received a consultation plus either oral homeopathic medicine or placebo, assessed every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were the activity score and profile score of the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP).Results: Eighty-five percent (85%) (45/53) of women completed the study. There was no evidence of a difference seen between groups for either activity (adjusted difference =–0.4, 95% confidence interval CI –1.0 to 0.2, p = 0.17) or profile scores (adjusted difference = –0.4, 95% CI –0.9 to 0.1, p = 0.13) using this trial design, although post hoc power calculations suggests that 65–175 would be needed per group to detect differences of this magnitude with sufficient precision. Clinically relevant improvements in symptoms and mood disturbance were seen for both groups over the study period.Conclusion: Improvements were seen for symptom scores over the study period. However, presuming these improvements were caused by the individualized homeopathic approach, the study failed to show clearly that the specific effect of the remedy added further to the nonspecific effects of the consultation. Future trial design must ensure adequate power to account for the nonspecific impact of such complex individualized interventions while pragmatic designs may more readily answer questions of clinical and cost effectiveness."
"AbstractObjective: To explore the safety and efficacy of fish oil to modulate parameters of inflammation and immunosenescence in HIV-infected older adults.Design: This study uses a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.Setting: The study was conducted in an outpatient HIV/AIDS clinic in a large urban Midwestern city in the United States.Subjects: A total of 37 clinically stable HIV-infected adults between the ages of 40 and 70 years of age participated.Interventions: Fish oil 1.6 g/day was administered for 12 weeks or placebo.Outcome measures: Inflammatory cytokine production, surface markers of immunosenescence, and adverse events were measured.Results: After 12 weeks of supplementation, there were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups on any measures of inflammation or immunosenescence in both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. More participants in the treatment group reported adverse gastrointestinal events compared with the control group.Conclusions: A 12-week supplementation regimen of 1.6 g/day of fish oil did not favorably modulate parameters of inflammation or immune senescence in HIV-infected adults. Future studies should test agents that directly target mechanisms that underlie HIV-related inflammation to determine whether reducing inflammation can reverse immunosenescence."
"AbstractObjectives: Naturopathic medicine has demonstrated efficacy at reducing risk factors for chronic disease. Targeting health behaviors of parents and caregivers in a group-based setting may improve the behaviors of children in their care. This study sought to assess the feasibility of such a program.Design: Participants of a six-session health education series were invited to respond to surveys and participate in a focus group about their health behaviors and their experience in the program.Subjects: Caregivers of children aged 0–6 attending publicly funded community centers in Ontario, Canada.Interventions: A 6-week group-based naturopathic education program to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors among caregivers.Outcome measures: Satisfaction with content and delivery, and frequency of healthy behaviors.Results: The majority of responses indicated satisfaction with the program, and an ongoing benefit 6 weeks and more after completion. There was a clear correlation between healthy behaviors of parents and children.Conclusions: A group-based naturopathic education program may be a feasible method of delivering primary-prevention education to caregivers, particularly in the domains of practicality and acceptability."
"AbstractObjectives: Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMS/PMDD) bother a substantial number of women. Homeopathy seems a promising treatment, but it needs investigation using reliable study designs. The feasibility of organizing an international randomized pragmatic trial on a homeopathic add-on treatment (usual care [UC] + HT) compared with UC alone was evaluated.Design: A multicenter, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial with parallel groups.Settings/Location: The study was organized in general and private homeopathic practices in the Netherlands and Sweden and in an outpatient university clinic in Germany.Subjects: Women diagnosed as having PMS/PMDD, based on prospective daily rating by the daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) during a period of 2 months, were included and randomized.Interventions: Women were to receive UC + HT or UC for 4 months. Homeopathic medicine selection was according to a previously tested prognostic questionnaire and electronic algorithm. Usual care was as provided by the women's general practitioner according to their preferences.Outcome measures: Before and after treatment, the women completed diaries (DRSP), the measure yourself concerns and well-being, and other questionnaires. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed.Results: In Germany, the study could not proceed because of legal limitations. In Sweden, recruitment proved extremely difficult. In the Netherlands and Sweden, 60 women were randomized (UC + HT: 28; UC: 32), data of 47/46 women were analyzed (ITT/PP). After 4 months, relative mean change of DRSP scores in the UC + HT group was significantly better than in the UC group (p = 0.03).Conclusions: With respect to recruitment and different legal status, it does not seem feasible to perform a larger, international, pragmatic randomized trial on (semi-)individualized homeopathy for PMS/PMDD. Since the added value of HT compared with UC was demonstrated by significant differences in symptom score changes, further studies are warranted."
"AbstractObjective: Working memory (WM) can influence human thought processes through interactions with perception, long-term memory, and behavior. In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and electric acupuncture have been used to improve the performance of WM. Therefore, due to the n-back task as a continuous performance task that is commonly used to measure WM, the aim of this study is to investigate the differences in short-term efficacy between tDCS and electroacupuncture on WM under n-back task paradigm in healthy subjects.Methods: Forty-four college students (age: 23.70 ± 1.52 years; education: 16.93 ± 2.24 years) were recruited as experimental subjects and randomly divided into two groups by a random double-blind two-stage crossover experiment design. Group A received a tDCS intervention followed by at least 1 week of washout period and then the electroacupuncture intervention. Group B had the opposite sequence of interventions. The WM test under the n-back task paradigm was conducted before and after each intervention, and the changes in the accuracy (number of correct responses) and correct response time (RT) before and after the interventions were detected. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 24.0 to compare the short-term efficacy of tDCS and electroacupuncture on WM under different tasks.Results: In the 0-back task and 1-back tasks, there was no significant difference in the accuracy or RT before and after the interventions between tDCS and electroacupuncture stimulation. In the 2-back task, there was no significant difference in the accuracy before and after interventions between tDCS and electroacupuncture stimulation. However, there was a significant difference in RT (p < 0.05), which was lower after tDCS than after electroacupuncture in the 2-back task.Conclusion: The results show that tDCS with anodal stimulation on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could increase the RT of the 2-back task performance in comparison with electroacupuncture stimulation of the Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints. The present results indicate that tDCS may have greater impact on WM in healthy subjects than electroacupuncture stimulation."
"AbstractBackground: Quality acupuncture influences the outcomes of clinical research, and issues associated with effective administration of acupuncture in randomized controlled trials need to be addressed when appraising studies.Objective: The study objective was to achieve consensus on domains and items for inclusion in a rating scale to assess quality acupuncture administered in clinical research.Study design and subjects: An active group of Australian acupuncture researchers initially identified a pool of items assessing quality. The Delphi consensus process was then used to select and reduce the number of items, and an additional expert panel of 42 researchers were invited to participate. Participants initially ranked items along a five-point scale for the first Delphi round, and indicated an agree or disagree response during the second round. For an item to be retained into the second round, an item had to attain greater than 80% agreement that the item described a dimension of quality acupuncture and related study design.Results: Thirty-two (32) experts agreed to participate in the study. After two rounds of the Delphi process, consensus was reached on 14 domains and 26 items relating to quality acupuncture. Domains, items, and minimum standards related to study design; rationale of the intervention; criteria relating to needling stimulation either manual or electrostimulation; duration and frequency of treatment; and practitioner training.Conclusions: Items for inclusion in an instrument to assess quality acupuncture in clinical research were identified. Further development of the instrument including relative weighting of items and reliability testing is under way."
"AbstractObjectives: Qualitative research has an important part to play in investigating how complex interventions are implemented within randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and what impact the RCT context has on participants, their behavior, and their outcomes. We explored these issues within a randomized sham-acupuncture controlled trial of traditional Chinese acupuncture for people with migraine.Method: All trial participants who consented to take part in this qualitative study were interviewed twice by a researcher who was blind to all trial data. The acupuncture practitioner was interviewed once. Nineteen (19) semistructured interviews, 30–60 minutes long, were transcribed, coded, and analyzed both across and within cases.Results: The 10 participants, 6 female, age 23–70 years had severe migraine and conventional treatment had been of limited benefit. They were satisfied with the organization of the trial and no acupuncture was perceived as obviously “sham.” Most participants, and the practitioner, actively “played their part” in the trial, taking on research roles that differed from their usual roles of “patient” and “doctor.” The resulting changes to their normal expectations and behavior influenced how the intervention was delivered and experienced. There was a reduction in talking, explanations, and participation, and treatment was focused on the migraine and usually excluded other conditions, even if the participants considered them to be a cause or a trigger of the migraine.Conclusions: We conclude that treatment in the trial differed from that described in studies of “real life” traditional acupuncture. These differences affected the needling—the characteristic or specific intervention—as well as contextual factors. This trial design limitation appears to be inevitable when a sham-controlled design is used to research an intervention that is based on a holistic and participative treatment strategy. These findings should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of RCTs of complex interventions such as acupuncture."
"AbstractObjectives: Discrimination in medical settings may influence patient attitudes about health care and health-seeking behaviors. Patients who experience discrimination may seek alternative means of health care, including use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between discrimination in health care and CAM use.Design: Data come from the 2001 Health Care Quality Survey (HCQS), which used a multistage sampling design with random-digit dialing, oversampling telephone exchanges with higher densities of African-American, Hispanic, and Asian households. The 2001 HCQS sample consisted of 6722 adults living in the continental United States. To correct for the disproportionate sample design, data were adjusted using sample weights to make the results representative of the U.S. population 18 years and older. Present analyses were limited to 6008 respondents who had visited a doctor or clinic or had been admitted to the hospital in the last 2 years.Outcome measures: Outcome measures were CAM use, practitioner-provided CAM use, and herbal medicine use.Results: In adjusted logistic regression analyses, discrimination in health care was significantly associated with use of herbal medicines alone (adjusted odds ratio=1.47, confidence interval: 1.05, 2.04), but not with use of practitioner-provided CAM (i.e., use of acupuncture, chiropractor, traditional healer or herbalist, alone or in combination with herbal medicines).Conclusions: Further research is needed to examine the direction of the relationship between discrimination and CAM use and differences by CAM modality."
"AbstractObjective: Primary aims of the proposed protocol are to determine the feasibility/acceptability of the active music engagement intervention protocol during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and clinical feasibility/acceptability of the biological sample collection schedule.Design: The authors propose a single-case, alternating treatment design to compare levels of child and caregiver cortisol in blood and saliva collected on alternating days, when the dyad receives and does not receive AME sessions. Included are the scientific rationale for this design and detailed intervention and sample collection schedules based on transplant type.Setting/Location: Pediatric inpatient HSCT unit.Subjects: Eligible participants are dyads of children 3–8 years old, hospitalized for HSCT, and their caregiver. Children with malignant and nonmalignant conditions will be eligible, regardless of transplant type.Intervention: AME intervention is delivered by a board-certified music therapist who tailors music-based play experiences to encourage active engagement in, and independent use of, music play to manage the inter-related emotional distress experienced by children and their caregivers during HSCT. Dyads will receive two 45-min AME sessions each week during hospitalization.Outcome Measures: Eight collections of blood (child) and saliva (child/caregiver) will be performed for cortisol measurement. The authors will also collect self-report and caregiver proxy measures for dyad emotional distress, quality of life, and family function. At study conclusion, qualitative caregiver interviews will be conducted.Results: Planned analyses will be descriptive and evaluate the feasibility of participant recruitment, cortisol collection, planned evaluations, and AME delivery. Analysis of qualitative interviews will be used to gain an understanding about the ease/burden of biological sample collection and any perceived benefit of AME.Conclusions: Behavioral intervention studies examining biological mechanisms of action in pediatric transplant populations are rare. Findings will provide important information about the feasibility/acceptability of collecting cortisol samples during a high-intensity treatment and advance understanding about the use of active music interventions to mitigate child/caregiver distress during the transplant period."
"AbstractObjectives: To determine the effects of a t'ai chi-applied worksite health promotion program on metabolic syndrome markers, health behaviors, and quality of life in middle-aged male office workers at a high risk of metabolic syndrome.Design: A prospective randomized controlled study.Setting: Health center of a government office building in Korea.Subjects: Forty-three male office workers with two or more metabolic syndrome markers.Interventions: The office workers were randomly assigned either to an experimental group that received t'ai chi combined with health education twice weekly for 12 weeks, or to a control group that received health education only.Outcome measures: Blood sampling for metabolic syndrome markers and structured questionnaires for health behaviors and quality of life.Results: The experimental group showed significant reductions in systolic (t = −3.103, p = 0.003) and diastolic (t = −2.159, p = 0.037) blood pressures and the triglyceride level (t = −2.451, p = 0.019) compared with the control group. Those in the experimental group also performed health behaviors more frequently (t = 4.047, p < 0.001) and reported a significantly better quality of life (t = 3.193, p = 0.003) than those in the control group.Conclusion: The study findings show that t'ai chi was an effective adjunctive intervention in a worksite health promotion program for middle-aged office workers at a high risk of metabolic syndrome. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of t'ai chi-applied worksite health promotion programs in individuals with confirmed metabolic syndrome."
"AbstractObjectives: Our understanding of acupuncture and Chinese medicine is limited by a lack of inquiry into the dynamics of the process. We used a longitudinal research design to investigate how the experience, and the effects, of a course of acupuncture evolved over time.Design and outcome measures: This was a longitudinal qualitative study, using a constant comparative method, informed by grounded theory. Each person was interviewed three times over 6 months. Semistructured interviews explored people's experiences of illness and treatment. Across-case and within-case analysis resulted in themes and individual vignettes.Subjects and settings: Eight (8) professional acupuncturists in seven different settings informed their patients about the study. We interviewed a consecutive sample of 23 people with chronic illness, who were having acupuncture for the first time.Results: People described their experience of acupuncture in terms of the acupuncturist's diagnostic and needling skills; the therapeutic relationship; and a new understanding of the body and self as a whole being. All three of these components were imbued with holistic ideology. Treatment effects were perceived as changes in symptoms, changes in energy, and changes in personal and social identity. The vignettes showed the complexity and the individuality of the experience of acupuncture treatment. The process and outcome components were distinct but not divisible, because they were linked by complex connections. The paper depicts these results as a diagrammatic model that illustrates the components and their interconnections and the cyclical reinforcement, both positive and negative, that can occur over time.Conclusions: The holistic model of acupuncture treatment, in which ""the whole being greater than the sum of the parts,"" has implications for service provision and for research trial design. Research trials that evaluate the needling technique, isolated from other aspects of process, will interfere with treatment outcomes. The model requires testing in different service and research settings."
"AbstractObjective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with block design paradigms with consecutive acupuncture stimulations, has often been used to investigate the neural responses to acupuncture. In this study, we investigated whether previous acupuncture stimulations can affect brain activations of later acupuncture stimulations.Design: All subjects were measured twice in the same scanning session and a block design was used.Setting: The study was conducted at Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.Subjects: Fifteen (15) healthy right-handed male volunteers participated in the study.Intervention: The subjects received two acupuncture stimulations on BL62 (Shenmai) on the right foot with a time interval of 5 minutes. In addition, sham stimulations were tested with the same paradigm.Outcome measures: One-sample t tests were conducted in order to map the brain activations induced by the acupuncture and sham stimulations. Moreover, paired-sample t tests were conducted to investigate the signal changes between the first and second acupuncture stimulation.Results: During the first acupuncture stimulation, in the left hemisphere, significant foci of activation were found in the hypothalamus, thalamus, claustrum, cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus. In the right hemisphere, a significant focus of activation was found in the middle frontal gyrus. In addition, in both hemispheres, a significant focus of activation was found in the inferior parietal lobule. Interestingly, however, during the second acupuncture stimulation, the only areas that were also significantly activated were the cerebellum in the left hemisphere and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere.Conclusions: We found that consecutive acupuncture stimulations on BL62 affected the neural responses in a significant way, resulting in decreased activations during the second acupuncture stimulation. This is an important finding, suggesting that in future fMRI studies on acupuncture, researchers should take this methodological issue more seriously."
"AbstractObjectives: Acupuncture has been gaining popularity among practitioners of modern medicine as an alternative and complementary treatment. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect still remains uncertain. The present study chose the GV20 acupoint to evaluate acupoint effectiveness, hypothesizing that its stimulation induces cerebrovascular responses.Design and setting: The effects of GV20 acupuncture treatment on middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) blood flow velocities, and CO2 reactivity during hypocapnia were evaluated in 10 healthy male subjects (mean age 25.6 ± 0.8 years). Measurements were done at rest and during hypocapnia, and were repeated four times each at different cerebral artery territories with an interval of 1 week. MCA and ACA blood flow velocities were measured with a transcranial Doppler flowmeter. Blood flow velocity was corrected to 40 mm Hg of end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2), and was expressed as CV40. CO2 reactivity was measured as percent change in mean blood flow velocity/mm Hg PETCO2.Results: Mean MCA and ACA blood flow velocities at rest, CV40, and CO2 reactivity during hypocapnia increased significantly after GV20 acupuncture treatment, whereas mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate at rest did not change significantly. The increases in MCA and ACA blood flow velocity were associated with improved CO2 reactivity after GV20 acupuncture treatment.Conclusions: The data suggest that GV20 acupuncture treatment increases cerebral blood flow. The results of this small-scale study provide preliminary evidence for acupuncture effectiveness."
"AbstractObjectives: The present study was performed to determine the effect of 5 weeks of acupuncture treatment in a group setting on pain and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infected individuals. Design: Twenty-one (21) subjects completed  the study that consisted of a pretreatment and post-treatment case series design. The subjects completed the Pain Rating Scale and the Subjective Peripheral Neuropathy Screen (SPNS) before and after 5 weeks of acupuncture. The acupuncture treatments occurred two evenings per week. Each of  the 10 sessions consisted of participants receiving 10–15 needle insertions in acupoints that addressed the individual's changing pattern of pain, sleep problems, or other health issues. The treatment utilized only main or common points located below the elbows and knees, and on the  head, neck, and ears. Only reactive points were used in the acupuncture treatments. Needles were left in situ for 30–45 minutes. Results: Comparison of the pretreatment and post-treatment Pain Rating Scale results indicated a significant reduction in present pain (p  = 0.0002), least and most pain in the last 24 hours (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively) and the total pain summary score (p < 0.0001). Symptoms reported in the SPNS were reduced during the 5 weeks of acupuncture. Scores for pain/aching/burning, pins and needles,  and numbness in the hands and feet were reduced (all significant at less than p 0.0065), as well as the total summary score (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that subjective pain and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were reduced during the  period of individual acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting. While the study design did not allow for control of nonspecific placebo factors, the data support the hypothesis that acupuncture in a group setting can reduce pain and neuropathic symptoms in HIV-infected individuals."
"AbstractObjective: This study's objective was to determine the effect of therapeutic massage on peripheral blood flow utilizing dynamic infrared thermography in a constant temperature/humidity thermal chamber to assess noncontact skin temperature.Design: The design was a repeated-measures crossover experimental design; the independent variable was treatment condition (massage, light touch, control).Setting: The study setting was a university research laboratory.Subjects: Seventeen (17) healthy volunteers (8 males/9 females; age = 23.29 ± 3.06) took part in the study.Interventions: One (1) 20-minute neck and shoulder therapeutic massage treatment was performed for each of the three treatment conditions.Outcome measures: The dependent variable was noncontact, mean skin temperature in 15 regions measured at 6 time points (pretest and 15, 25, 35, 45, and 60 minutes post-test) for each treatment condition.Results: The massage treatment produced significant elevations in temperature in five regions: anterior upper chest (p = 0.04), posterior neck (p = 0.0006), upper back (p = 0.0005), posterior right arm (p = 0.03), and middle back (p = 0.02). Massage therapy produced significant increases in temperature over time, compared to the other conditions, in the anterior upper chest, and posterior neck, upper back, right arm, and the middle back. Additionally, the temperatures remained above baseline levels after 60 minutes. Interestingly, the massage treatment produced significant temperature elevations in two nonmassaged areas posterior right arm and middle back.Conclusions: These changes in temperature suggest corresponding changes in peripheral blood flow in the treated areas as well as in adjacent not-massaged areas. Moreover, the results suggest dynamic infrared thermography as a useful tool to measure noninvasive, noncontact changes in peripheral blood flow for massage therapy research."
"AbstractAim of study: To explore issues that need to be addressed in the design of a clinical trial of acupuncture for people with depression.Methods: In this study we conducted a focus group with 6 volunteer participants with experiences of depression, and a prospective case series of 10 patients who received acupuncture treatment for their depression. In the case series study, 10 patients were referred by their general practitioner, and received up to 10 individualized acupuncture treatments from one of two acupuncturists. Acupuncturists recorded traditional acupuncture diagnoses and details of the treatment provided. Measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and health status (SF-36) were taken at baseline and 10 weeks later. Changes in mean before and after scores were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Adverse events were also monitored.Results: The focus group and the case series both identified considerable heterogeneity among people with depression. In the case series, only 6 patients both received treatment and completed 10-week questionnaires; however, significant improvements between before and after were found in their levels of depression (p < 0.05). Many factors, as well as the acupuncture, may have contributed to these improvements. No serious adverse events occurred. In the context of designing a clinical trial of acupuncture for depression, a series of methodological challenges is explored.Conclusion: This study highlighted the complexities of evaluating acupuncture for patients with depression. Successfully addressing the identified methodological challenges in the design of a trial will increase its relevance and impact."
"AbstractObjectives: To develop and test the safety and effectiveness of an acupressure garment (the Relief Brief) in decreasing the pain and symptom distress associated with dysmenorrhea.Design:          A randomized clinical trial applied a 2 (Relief Brief use or control group) × 3 (baseline and two treatment measurement occasions) mixed factorial design.Participants: Sixty-one (61) women          with moderately severe primary dysmenorrhea were randomly assigned to the standard treatment control group or the Relief Brief acupressure device group after one pretreatment menses, with 58 women reporting          the effect on their pain during two post-treatment menstrual cycles.The acupressure garment: The Relief Brief is a cotton Lycra panty brief with a fixed number of lower abdominal and lower back          latex foam acupads that provide pressure to dysmenorrhea-relieving Chinese acupressure points.Outcome measures: Menstrual pain severity (worst pain and symptom intensity), pain medication use,          and adverse effects were analyzed using between-groups and repeated measures analyses of treatment effects. Statistical and clinical significance criteria were applied a priori.Results:          For pain measures and pain medication use, the group main effect, time main effect and group × time interaction were statistically significant. Median pain medication use, the same for both groups          at baseline (6 pills per day), dropped to 2 pills per day for the Relief Brief group but remained at 6 pills for the control group at the second treatment cycle. Predicted clinical significance criteria          were surpassed: almost all (90%) women wearing the Relief Brief obtained at least a 25% reduction in menstrual pain severity (a 2-3 point drop) compared to only 8% of the control group (z = 6.07;          p < 0.05). Relief Brief use was associated with at least a 50% decline in menstrual pain symptom intensity in more than two thirds of the women.Conclusions: An acupressure device is          an effective and safe nonpharmacologic strategy for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. With design modifications, it could serve as a main treatment modality for women who suffer from primary dysmenorrhea          and do not wish to or cannot use the conventional pharmacologic agents. In addition, this acupressure device may serve as an adjuvant therapy to medication in more severe cases of dysmenorrhea.      "
"AbstractObjectives: Chronic back pain affects a large proportion of both the general population and of military veterans. Although numerous therapies exist for treating chronic back pain, they can be costly and tend to have limited effectiveness. Thus, demonstrating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of additional treatment alternatives is important. The purpose of our study was to examine the benefits of a yoga intervention for Veterans Administration (VA) patients.Subjects/intervention: VA patients with chronic back pain were referred by their primary care providers to a yoga program as part of clinical care. Before starting yoga, a VA physician trained in yoga evaluated each patient to ensure that they could participate safely.Design: The research study consisted of completing a short battery of questionnaires at baseline and again 10 weeks later.Outcome measures: Questionnaires included measures of pain, depression, energy/fatigue, health-related quality of life, and program satisfaction. Paired t-tests were used to compare baseline scores to those at the 10-week follow-up for the single group, pre–post design. Correlations were used to examine whether yoga attendance and home practice were associated with better outcomes.Results: Baseline and follow-up data were available for 33 participants. Participants were VA patients with a mean age of 55 years. They were 21% female, 70% white, 52% married, 68% college graduates, and 44% were retired. Significant improvements were found for pain, depression, energy/fatigue, and the Short Form-12 Mental Health Scale. The number of yoga sessions attended and the frequency of home practice were associated with improved outcomes. Participants appeared highly satisfied with the yoga instructor and moderately satisfied with the ease of participation and health benefits of the yoga program.Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that a yoga intervention for VA patients with chronic back pain may improve the health of veterans. However, the limitations of a pre–post study design make conclusions tentative. A larger randomized, controlled trial of the yoga program is planned."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in cognitive functions.Methods: The study was conducted on 32 healthy adult male student volunteers who had never practiced meditation before the study. The study consisted of practicing 20 minutes of guided meditation and administration of psychologic stress to the subjects. The psychologic stress was administered to the subjects by asking them to play a (preselected) stressful computer game. The subjects were asked to meditate either before or after the administration of psychologic stress. For the control group measurements, the subjects were asked to wait quietly for an equivalent period of meditation time.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG), sympathetic reactivity (QTc/QS2 ratio), cortisol, and acute psychologic stress scores. The central nervous system functions were assessed using Wechsler memory scale and visual-choice reaction time (VCRT). These parameters were measured both at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, using a pre–post experimental test design.Results: Computer game stress was associated with a significant increase in physiologic (GSR, EMG, HR, QTc/QS2) and psychologic (acute stress questionnaire scores) markers of stress. Meditation was associated with relaxation (significant decrease in GSR, EMG, QTc/QS2, and acute stress questionnaire scores). Meditation, if practiced before the stressful event, reduced the adverse effects of stress. Memory quotient significantly increased, whereas cortisol level decreased after both stress and meditation. VCRT showed no significant change.Conclusions: Practice of meditation produced a relaxation response even in the young adult subjects who had never practiced meditation before. The practice of meditation reduced the physiologic stress responses without taking away the beneficial effect of stress, namely, improved memory scores."
"AbstractObjectives: The Oregon Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) conducted focus groups with participants to determine willingness to join a complementary and alternative medicine          (CAM) research study, and to aid in the design of three clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CAM and craniofacial disorders.Setting/location: Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente,          in Portland, Oregon.Subjects: Kaiser Permanente health plan members meeting RCT inclusion criteria.Design: Twelve (12) focus groups were conducted with a total of 85 participants.          Six (6) of the focus groups were with members who self-identified as users of CAM therapies. Focus groups explored participants' experiences of CAM for temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and periodontal disease,          and their reactions to proposed aspects of the trials. Trained facilitators led the focus groups, which lasted approximately 2 hours and were audiotaped for future transcription. Researchers then coded          the transcripts to identify responses to specific questions and to capture emergent themes.Results: Acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage were most frequently accessed and reported as helpful          by participants. Participants who had not used CAM treatments for their condition expressed interest and openness to experiencing CAM treatments through a research study. In general, participants expressed          willingness to be randomly assigned to (rather than choose) a CAM treatment arm. Travel to practitioners' offices and frequent (> 1 per week) visits were acceptable to most participants, if there was          flexibility in appointment scheduling.Conclusions: Findings indicate considerable willingness to engage in CAM trials, even among individuals who have not used CAM. Participants' willingness          to engage in CAM studies was influenced by the nature of their condition, their prior experiences with conventional and CAM treatments, and the possibility of experiencing CAM ""for free"" through participation          in the trial. Their acceptance also was tempered by concerns about particular modalities and the possibility of having to give up aspects of their current health routine. Researchers engaging in CAM studies          should take these factors into consideration as they design studies.      "
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to look at the impact of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment of individuals with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) and to present preliminary results which compare health care utilization pre- and postmanagement of individuals with MCS.Study design: The design for this study was that for a cohort study.Settings/location: The setting for this study was the Nova Scotia Environmental Health Centre (NSEHC; Fall River, Nova Scotia, Canada).Patients and methods: Following ethical approval, individuals who had filled a detailed-symptoms questionnaire and had agreed to participate in research activities were linked to their medical insurance records, using encrypted numbers and a blind procedure for confidentiality. Diagnosis by the NSEHC; physicians followed the consensus criteria for multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). A total of 563 patients formed 3 cohorts (145 in 1998; 181 in 1999; and 237 in 2000).Results: Physicians' visits by general practitioner and by specialists, emergency and hospital separations, and associated costs showed a relative decrease in the years following the consultation at the NSEHC. The overall yearly decline in consultations between the years before the initial consultation until 2002, for each cohort, was: 9.1% for the 1998 cohort; 8% for the 1999 cohort; and 10.6% for the 2000 cohort; compared with 1.3% for the overall Nova Scotia population. Relative to the provincial utilization costs, the standardized average yearly decrease in utilization costs for the 3 cohorts combined was 8.7%, or a total savings of $77,440. The 1998 cohort showed a sustained decrease up to 2002, reaching a level similar to the overall Nova Scotia population. Those with high symptom scores had the highest reduction in mean physician visits (31% for the 1998 cohort) in the following years. Conclusions: Presented in this paper are the preliminary results of the health care utilization costs in the management of individuals with MCS. Despite the limitations of our study design, the initial findings from this study are encouraging and warrant further exploration. These results indicate a possible impact on the long-term health care utilization from the NSEHC's management strategies, although a further controlled study, with a longer follow-up, may be necessary to confirm these findings."
"AbstractConventional opinion states that randomization is the appropriate way to allocate participants to treatments in biomedical studies. The most frequently cited justification is that it is the only method          that guarantees balance between treatment groups with respect to all prognostic factors, whether measured or not. Here it is shown by simple arguments that this justification is false and misleading. Design-adaptive          allocations are an alternative to randomization that are easy to implement, and virtually guarantee better balance than randomization, for both measured and unmeasured factors. The fraction of studies that          will exhibit severe imbalance under randomization is not always trivial. For this reason, in small studies or studies with subgroup analyses or many prognostic factors, design-adaptive allocation is an          attractive alternative to randomization. These considerations are particularly relevant to complementary and alternative medicine studies, where resources are relatively scarce, and otherwise underpowered          studies might lead to premature termination of promising research paths.

"AbstractObjectives: This pilot study aimed to compare the efficacy of manual pressure release (MPR), strain counterstrain (SCS), and integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique (INIT) in the management of chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP).Design: Single-blind, randomized, controlled pilot trial.Setting: Neurosurgery clinic.Subjects: Forty-eight patients (46 women; mean age, 35.47 ± 10.58 years) diagnosed chronic nonspecific LBP and who had at least one active myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in the quadratus lumborum, iliocostalis lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles were included.Interventions: Patients received a standard home exercise program in addition to the MPR technique (MPR group), SCS technique (SCS group), and INIT (INIT group) for 12 sessions (2 days/week for 6 weeks).Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes were MTrP examination, pressure pain threshold, lumbar active range of motion, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Beck depression inventory, and state-trait anxiety inventory.Results: There is no significant difference in terms of the percentage of deactivated MTrPs after 1st session and 12th session between groups (p > 0.05), but the percentage of deactivated MTrPs was less in MPR group than other groups. The overall group-by-time interaction for the repeated measures analysis of variance was not significant for primary and secondary outcomes (p > 0.05), but the improvement in the VAS-activity and the ODI was slightly better in the SCS group compared with other groups.Conclusions: These preliminary findings, which might help provide a glimpse into the clinical effectiveness of three manual therapy techniques (MPR, SCS, and INIT) rather than statistical significance, indicated that SCS or INIT might provide slightly better improvement in pain during activity, deactivation of MTrPs, and disability related to pain in chronic nonspecific LBP."
"AbstractObjectives: This study sought to determine whether participants in taijiquan classes would report increases in mindfulness greater than that of a comparison group, and whether changes in mindfulness were associated with improvements in mood, perceived stress, self-regulatory self-efficacy, and sleep quality.Design: The study design was quasi-experimental with repeated measures.Settings/location: The study was set in a midsized public university.Subjects: Students aged 18–48 years old enrolled in 15-week courses of either taijiquan (n=76) or special recreation (control group, n=132).Intervention: Chen-style taijiquan classes were offered 2 times per week for 50 minutes each time.Outcome measures: Self-report of mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), mood (Four Dimensional Mood Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), self-regulatory self-efficacy (Self-regulatory Self-Efficacy Scale), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).Results: Increases in total mindfulness scores occurred only in the taijiquan group, not in the control group. All well-being variables showed a pattern of improvement in the taijiquan group, with either stability or decline over time in the control group. Increases in mindfulness were significantly correlated with improvements on all well-being measures and with sleep quality.Conclusions: Relative to a recreation control group, taijiquan classes for college students are associated with increased mindfulness and improved sleep quality, mood, and perceived stress, but not self-regulatory self-efficacy. Randomized control design studies are needed to substantiate the causal role of taijiquan exercise in the development of mindfulness and associated improvements in well-being."
"AbstractObjectives: (1) To evaluate the evidence on the effect of chiropractic care, rather than spinal manipulation only, on patients with nonmusculoskeletal conditions; and (2) to identify shortcomings in the evidence base on this topic, from a Whole Systems Research perspective.Design: Systematic review.Methods: Databases included were PubMed, Ovid, Mantis, Index to Chiropractic Literature, and CINAHL. Search restrictions were human subjects, peer-reviewed journal, English language, and publication before May 2005. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and Jadad checklists; a checklist developed from the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines; and one developed by the authors to evaluate studies in terms of Whole Systems Research (WSR) considerations.Results: The search yielded 179 papers addressing 50 different nonmusculoskeletal conditions. There were 122 case reports or case series, 47 experimental designs, including 14 RCTs, 9 systematic reviews, and 1 a large cohort study. The 14 RCTs addressed 10 conditions. Six RCTs were rated “high” on the 3 conventional checklists; one of these 6 was rated “high” in terms of WSR considerations.Conclusions: (1) Adverse effects should be routinely reported. For the few studies that did report, adverse effects of spinal manipulation for all ages and conditions were rare, transient, and not severe. (2) Evidence from controlled studies and usual practice supports chiropractic care (the entire clinical encounter) as providing benefit to patients with asthma, cervicogenic vertigo, and infantile colic. Evidence was promising for potential benefit of manual procedures for children with otitis media and elderly patients with pneumonia. (3) The RCT design is not necessarily incompatible with WSR. RCTs could improve generalizability by basing protocols on usual practice. (4) Case reports could contribute more to WSR by increasing their emphasis on patient characteristics and patient-based outcomes. (5) Chiropractic investigators, practitioners, and funding agencies should increase their attention to observational designs."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to design and implement a practical data collection system capable of obtaining pain and quality-of-life outcome measures in a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) outpatient clinic and (2) to evaluate changes in  patient status over time using these objective measures. Design: A prospective study was carried out in an outpatient practice based setting. Scannable forms were designed utilizing Cardiff's TELEform® system (Cardiff Software, Inc., Vista, CA) for data collection. Setting/location: This study was conducted at Special Care Holistic Wellness Connection, an urban-based, hospital-affiliated, CAM clinic in Connecticut. Subjects: Inclusion criteria consisted of: a starting pain level of 2 or more, subjects receiving 3 or more treatments in  a specific modality, and a completed SF-12v2® Health Survey (Quality Metric Inc., Lincoln, RI). A total of 94 subjects were evaluated for acupuncture, chiropractic, or naturopathy. Outcome measures: The Numeric Pain Analogue Scale and SF-12v2® Health  Survey were used for subject evaluations and were compared from the first to the last treatments. International Classification of Disease codes were utilized to correlate and track the diagnosis. Results: An outcome measures data management system was successfully implemented into  a CAM outpatient clinical setting. Significant decreases in pain were observed in subjects receiving acupuncture, chiropractic, or naturopathy. In addition, improvements in various subscales of the SF-12v2® Physical and Mental Health categories were observed for each CAM treatment  modality studied.Conclusions: This study established that a practical data collection system could be implemented in a CAM clinic utilizing several treatment modalities. In addition, outcome measures demonstrated both a significant reduction in pain and improvement in quality of  life for subjects who utilized acupuncture, chiropractic, or naturopathy treatments."
"AbstractObjectives: Physical therapy (PT) modalities are used in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Acupuncture is a treatment option often sought after by FMS patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of PT modalities with those of acupuncture on pain, daily function, and quality of life in FMS patients.Design: A comparative effectiveness study.Setting and Subjects: Forty-four female patients between the ages of 18–70 years presenting to Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine with a new diagnosis of FMS according to the American College of Rheumatology, with manifestations of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain symptoms, normal routine blood tests, and a desire to receive PT or acupuncture were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included the presence of neurologic, inflammatory, endocrinologic, and other chronic diseases, psychiatric illness, use of antidepressants or analgesics, and contraindication to treatment with PT modalities.Interventions: One group (n = 22) received 15 sessions of hotpack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and ultrasound to the tender points of the cervical and upper back regions. The other group (n = 22) received 10 sessions of formulated acupuncture aimed at treating pain of the neck, upper, and lower back regions.Outcome measures: Pain, functionality, and quality of life measured using the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) before and after treatment.Results: There was a reduction in all SF-MPQ domains and FIQ scores after treatment in both the PT and acupuncture groups. There was no difference in pre- and post-treatment scores between the two groups.Conclusions: PT modalities and acupuncture can be effectively used in the treatment of FMS. Even though one treatment option was not found to be more beneficial than the other, longer post-treatment follow-up may help determine the superior treatment option."
"AbstractThe purpose of this paper is the exploration and explication of the complex phenomena of ""healing presence"" 				 and of appropriately supportive theoretical approaches to integrate emerging models for research design. Healing presence is described as an interpersonal, intrapersonal, and transpersonal to transcendent phenomenon that leads to a beneficial, therapeutic, and/or positive spiritual change within another individual (healee) and also within the healer. An integrated framework merging knowledge from diverse fields of research develops the multiple elements of healing presence, the healer, the healee's capacity for response and the healing effect as an entangled phenomenon. A conceptual systemic model is presented, and questions and dilemmas that emerge are delineated. An integrated qualitative–quantitative research design is proposed. A systemic relationship model, which includes the healer, the healee, and persons within the healee's environment is presented. The challenges are substantial, but the research questions are meaningful and worthwhile. The goal is to foster healing at bio-psycho-social-spiritual levels of the human being."
"AbstractObjectives: To explore the feasibility and acceptability of providing acupuncture treatment to relieve pain and nausea symptoms in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.Design: Prospective feasibility study.Settings/Location: Public safety net hospital with a 20-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU.Subjects: Patients from all services admitted to the ICU from November 14, 2014 to April 2015.Interventions: Three 20 min acupuncture treatments given for consented patients who were experiencing pain and/or nausea, in addition to usual care.Outcome measures: Primary outcomes assessed were the proportion of patients offered acupuncture who accepted it, their perceptions of the effects of acupuncture treatment on pain and nausea, and the incidence of adverse effects related to acupuncture. Secondary outcomes included medication use, ICU and hospital length of stay, and frequency and pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses.Results: Of the 576 patients admitted to the ICU, 32.2% were deemed eligible for acupuncture and 42% of these (8% of total) received it. Self-reported pain level immediately after treatment decreased from the pain score reported immediately before treatment by 2.36 points.The majority of patients reported a benefit from acupuncture on symptoms of pain and also an anxiolytic effect. No major adverse effects were reported. There was a significant decrease in morphine usage after each treatment. The most common single TCM diagnosis was Qi and blood stagnation.Conclusions: Acupuncture is feasible, safe, and acceptable in an ICU setting by patients from diverse backgrounds."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the sleep quality of patients who inhaled placebo and those who inhaled an aroma comprising a mixture of Lavandula x intermedia (Lavandin Super), Citrus bergamia (bergamot), and Cananga odorata (ylang ylang).Design: This was a randomized, double-blind crossover study, which compared a treatment with placebo.Settings/location: The study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation unit located in an urban, private nonprofit hospital in north Texas.Subjects: Participants included 42 adult patients referred to the rehabilitation service following hospitalizations by local cardiologists.Interventions: Cotton balls infused with a combination of lavender, bergamot, and ylang ylang or placebo were placed at subjects' bedsides for five nights. After a washout period, subjects crossed over to the other condition for five nights.Outcome measures: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) after treatment and placebo periods. Lower PSQI scores indicate better sleep quality.Results: The mean PSQI global score was statistically significantly lower when receiving the intervention oil (mean = 4.9) than the mean PSQI global score when receiving placebo (mean = 8). Duration of sleep and the time it took to fall asleep were no different between treatment groups, but patient-reported sleep quality was significantly better when participants were exposed to essential oils (χ2 = 4.5, p = 0.03) than when exposed to placebo. Although sleep efficiency (time asleep while lying in bed) was perceived as the same under both conditions, participants reported that they had to get up to use the bathroom significantly less often when exposed to the treatment than when exposed to placebo (t = −2.04, p = 0.05; Wilcoxon p = 0.05). Participants also reported that they had trouble sleeping because they felt too cold, which occurred significantly less often when exposed to the treatment than when exposed to placebo (t = −2.03, p = 0.05; Wilcoxon p = 0.05).Conclusions: Sleep quality of participants receiving intervention oils was significantly better than the sleep quality of participants receiving the placebo oil. Low-cost, nontraditional aromatherapy treatment is potentially effective for improving sleep quality among cardiac rehabilitation patients."
"AbstractObjectives: This pilot study explores the methodological implications of evaluating the use of acupuncture in the treatment of disabling breathlessness.Design: A randomized, controlled          trial involving three treatments that were used on one occasion, each in random order.Settings: The study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of providing acupuncture treatment on a domiciliary          basis, in Southampton (United Kingdom) to patients with disabling breathlessness.Subjects: Sixteen (16) subjects with disabling breathlessness caused by chronic lung disease (primarily chronic          obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) were recruited from the respiratory medicine clinics of Southampton University Hospitals Trust.Interventions: The treatments were real acupuncture, dummy          acupuncture, and mock trans-electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).Outcomes: To evaluate the respiratory outcome measures, to look at the credibility of the three treatments (using a previously          validated Borkovec and Nau scale), and to calculate the sample size for a larger, more definitive study.Results: Twelve (12) subjects completed the study. The acupuncture was a predefined point          prescription that had been found previously to be of value in this condition, an approach that could be taught to health professionals and provided on a domiciliary basis. The treatment was provided only          on one occasion, therefore, we did not expect a clear therapeutic benefit to emerge, but some nonsignificant benefit was noted as a consequence of acupuncture treatment. The shuttle test that we used as          an objective measure of breathlessness was impractical in a domiciliary environment and will not be used in further studies. Each of the three treatments was equally credible at the outset, although real          and dummy acupuncture were considered by the patients to be preferable choices after the completion of treatment.Conclusions: It was possible to carry out this study on a domiciliary basis.          The information obtained will allow us to design a much clearer definitive study and the small, but statistically insignificant, response to acupuncture has allowed us to estimate sample size.      "
"AbstractObjectives: This exploratory study is the first systematic outcome evaluation to examine the effects of an 8-week meditation-based program in mindfulness in a German sample.Design: Twenty-one          (21) participants with chronic physical, psychologic, or psychosomatic illnesses were examined in a longitudinal pretest and post-treatment design with a 3-month follow-up.Outcome measures:          Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. Emotional and general physical well-being, sense of coherence, overall psychologic distress, and satisfaction with life were measured with standardized          instruments.Results: Overall, the interventions led to high levels of adherence to the meditation practice and satisfaction with the benefits of the course, as well as effective and lasting          reductions of symptoms (especially in psychologic distress, well-being, and quality of life). Changes were of moderate-to-large effect sizes. Positive complementary effects with psychotherapy were also          found.Conclusions: These findings warrant controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction as an intervention for chronic physical and          psychosomatic disorders in Germany.

"AbstractObjectives:Qigong exercise has been shown to improve physical and psychological well-being in adults with chronic conditions, but little is known about the feasibility and acceptability of engaging in a qigong exercise program in community-dwelling older adults in the United States. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility, acceptance, and adherence to an 8-week qigong exercise intervention in community-dwelling American older adults.Design: An exploratory study design.Setting: Two senior centers in southern Connecticut.Subjects: Forty-five community-dwelling older adults aged 65 to 85 years enrolled.Intervention: A supervised 1-h health qigong exercise session twice weekly for 8 weeks.Outcome measures: An investigator-designed questionnaire with seven items that were rated on a 1 to 6 scale, with higher scores indicating better results, and nine open-ended questions were used to obtain data on feasibility and acceptability. Adherence was calculated as the proportion of the 16 planned sessions attended.Results: Of the 45 older adults enrolled, 6 never started and 6 withdrew, with 33 evaluable at the end of the intervention. The mean age of the sample was 74.8 years; the majority were female (84.4%) and white (91.1%). Mean scores on aspects of difficulty, acceptability, suitability, or effectiveness of qigong exercise were all ≥5. Participants identified benefits of qigong exercise, such as calming and relaxing feelings, inner peace, better balance, and flexibility. Attendance rate was 78.8%, with 94% performing qigong exercise at least once weekly outside the class. All participants indicated that they would recommend qigong exercise to others. No adverse events occurred.Conclusion: An 8-week qigong exercise program was feasible, acceptable, and safe for American older adults. Future robust randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings."
"AbstractObjectives: The study of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) using a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design poses challenges, such as treatment standardization and blinding. We designed an RCT, which avoided these two common challenges, to evaluate the effect of adding the relaxation response (RR) to usual acupuncture treatment. In this paper, we report on the feasibility and patients' experience from the study participation.Design, setting, and subjects: Our study was a two-arm, double-blind RCT conducted in an acupuncture clinic in Boston. Study subjects were patients with human immunodeficiency virus/autoimmunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), who reported having at least one of the highly prevalent HIV-related symptoms, and were receiving acupuncture treatment.Intervention: The intervention group wore earphones to listen to tapes with instructions to elicit the RR and also soft music while receiving acupuncture treatment, while the control group only listened to soft music. The intervention group was also required to listen to the RR tapes at home daily.Outcome measures: A study evaluation was completed upon termination of the 12-week study (36 intervention and 44 control patients).Results: A majority of participants in both groups reported: no discomfort wearing earphones (82.9%, 81.8%); the study met their expectations (87.1%, 85.4%); and they would recommend the study to others (91.1%, 90.5%). Intervention participants reported better experiences with the tapes than the control group (p = 0.056) (72.4% versus 52.8% felt better with tapes; 3.5% versus 16.7% felt better without tapes; and 24.1% versus 30.6% felt no difference). Intervention participants were also more likely than the control group (p = 0.02) to report positive emotional/physical/spiritual changes (45.5% vs. 20.9%) and relaxed/peaceful/calm feelings (30.3% vs. 25.6%) from the study participation.Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a unique trial that examined the synergistic effects of two types of CAM practices. The intervention group reported more positive study-related experiences than the control group."
"AbstractObjectives: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of studying whole systems of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Naturopathic medicine (NM) in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMD), and to determine whether there is indication to support further research.Design: A pilot study using a randomized controlled clinical trial design of whole system TCM and NM versus state-of-the-art specialty care (SC).Setting/location: Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), and practitioner offices in Portland, Oregon.Subjects: One hundred and sixty (160) women 25–55 years of age attending a KPNW TMD specialty clinic.Interventions: Whole system TCM and NM, and KPNW TMD clinic SC; the intervention protocols were designed to model the individually tailored type of community care offered in alternative medicine practices in Portland and in the KPNW TMD clinic, using protocols that enhanced similarities among practitioners within each system and permitted full descriptions of the treatments provided.Outcome measures: TMD was ascertained using the Research Diagnostic Criteria/TMD; outcomes were self-reported worst and average facial pain and interference with activities (scaled 0–10 where 10 is worst).Results: Of 948 consecutive eligible patients, 160 were randomized to one of three arms; 128 provided endpoint data. TCM and NM demonstrated significantly greater in-treatment reductions for worst facial pain compared to SC (adjusted regression analysis; higher negative values indicate greater improvement, = −1.11 ± 0.43, p = 0.010 and −1.02 ± 0.45, p = 0.025 for TCM and NM, respectively, compared to SC) and at 3 months post-treatment (−1.07 ± 0.51, p = 0.037 and −1.27 ± 0.54, p = 0.019 for TCM and NM versus SC, respectively). Additionally, TCM provided significantly greater decreases in average pain than SC; NM provided significantly greater decreases than SC or TCM in TMD-related psychosocial interference.Conclusions: These alternative medicine approaches each resulted in significantly greater reduction of pain and psychosocial interference than SC. Further research on the potential benefits of traditional whole systems of medicine for TMD appears warranted."
"AbstractObjective: This study was designed to explore the effects of drinking an average dietary volume of functional water on blood pressure, short-term cardiovascular variables, and salivary immunoglobulin A.Design: Subjects were studied in a randomized pre–post crossover design the morning after an overnight fast.Subjects: Fifteen (15) healthy nonsmoking subjects, 8 males and 7 females, aged between 15 and 49 years, participated in the study.Intervention: Short-term (10 minute) electrocardiography was measured in the participants before and after drinking either control mineral or functional water. The measurements were randomized, double blinded, and held two weeks apart. Saliva was collected for 4 minutes before the start of each electrocardiograph measurement. Blood pressure was monitored at 5 minute intervals for one hour as the mean of triplicate consecutive measurements.Results: Drinking 100 mL of control mineral or functional water did not alter arterial blood pressure in the 60 minutes post-drinking. Drinking control mineral water led to a significant fall in the heart rate, although all time domain and power density parameters remained unaffected. Consumption of functional water resulted in a significant difference in all time domain measures and in three of the power density parameters. The heart rate fell, while RR interbeat intervals, standard deviation of the normal-to-normal heartbeats (SDNN), and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD) increased. A large rise in low (LF) and high frequency (HF) power had a significant effect on total power, indicating homeodynamic balance. Elevated LF power indicated intensified spectral power at frequencies in the range of 0.1 Hz, thus improving autonomic stability. The effect on the heart rate may confirm changes in cellular metabolism. Parasympathetic pathway activation stimulated secretory immunoglobulin A on mucosal surfaces, which protects against pathogenic invasion.Conclusions: The drinking of functional water in healthy subjects elicited a rapid parasympathetic restorative response from the heart as well as stimulating mucosal humoral immunity. Functional water acts as an unconditional natural stimulus that elicits an involuntary response and facilitates physiological homeostasis."
"AbstractAims and Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) chip and turmeric chip as a local drug delivery (LDD) agent in the treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis.Materials and Methods: A total of 120 sites with pocket depths 5–8 mm were chosen as a split mouth design at 3 sites in the same patient. Selected sites were randomly divided into three groups to receive CHX chip in addition to scaling and root planing (SRP) in group A, turmeric chip in addition to SRP in group B, and SRP only in group C. Clinical parameters, that is, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and relative attachment level (RAL) were recorded at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months interval.Result: On applying statistical analysis, results revealed that there was a significant reduction in all the clinical parameters, that is, PI, GI, PPD, and gain in RAL from baseline to 1 month and 3 months in all the three groups. These results were found to be significantly high in the CHX group and turmeric group than in the SRP group. Also, the results in both the test groups were maintained till the end of the study periods, but SRP group showed a significant deterioration after 1 month as was seen by increase in PPD and decrease in RAL scores after 3 months in the SRP group.Conclusion: Both the treatment modalities with the application of LDD as an adjunct to SRP proved to be equally beneficial in the treatment of chronic periodontitis."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a structured, 8-week, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on perceived stress, mood, endocrine function, immunity,          and functional health outcomes in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Design: This study used a quasiexperimental, nonrandomized design.Methods: Subjects          were specifically recruited (nonrandom) for intervention (MBSR) or comparison group. Data were collected at pretest and post-test in the MBSR group and at matched times in the comparison group. t          Tests where performed to determine within-group changes and between-group differences.Results: Natural killer cell activity and number increased significantly in the MBSR group compared to the          comparison group. No significant changes or differences were found for psychological, endocrine, or functional health variables.Conclusions: These results provide tentative evidence that MBSR          may assist in improving immunity in individuals infected with HIV.

"AbstractObjectives: Among different exercise models proposed for individuals with Parkinson's disease (IwPD), the popularity of traditional forms of dance is increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Sardinian folk dance (Ballu Sardu, BS) on functional performance and motor and nonmotor symptoms in IwPD.Design: Single-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial.Settings: Outpatient health clinic.Subjects and interventions: Twenty IwPD (13M, 7F; 67.4 ± 6.1 years) were randomly assigned to BS (n = 10) or usual care (n = 10). The dance program consisted of two sessions/week, 90-min/class, for 12 weeks.Outcome measures: Motor and nonmotor symptoms, as well as functional performance, were evaluated using different questionnaires and tests such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part-III (UPDRS-III), 6-min walking test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST), Back Scratch Test (BST), Sit-and-Reach Test (SRT), instrumented gait analysis, Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale (PFS-16), Beck Depression Inventory, Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale.Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant Time × Group interactions for UPDRS-III and functional variables such as the 6MWT, BBS, FTSST, TUG (all, p < 0.001), BST (p = 0.04), and gait analysis parameters (stride length, p = 0.031; gait speed, p = 0.049; and gait fatigue index (GFI), p = 0.005). For nonmotor symptoms, significant Time × Group interactions for depression (p < 0.001), apathy (p = 0.016), and MOCA scores (p = 0.012) were observed. Of note, for GFI and SAS, the BS group only showed a trend toward improvement, while the condition of the controls worsened significantly. No between-group differences were observed for SRT and PFS-16.Conclusions: BS is an enjoyable activity, which has been proved to be superior to usual care alone in inducing changes in different motor and nonmotor symptoms associated with PD. Results show that BS can be considered a safe tool for contrasting impairments observed in IwPD due to the intrinsic nature of the neurodegenerative disease."
"AbstractObjective: Renal colic caused by ureteral stone is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). This study was designed to measure meridian electrical conductance of patients with ureteral stone in emergency settings.Design: A cohort of patients who had ureteral calculus and acute renal colic and who had visited the ED was enrolled in this study. A device, the design of which is based on the Ryodoraku theory, was used to measure the meridian electrical conductance of patients in the ED. Sixty (60) patients (aged 42.0 ± 12.6 years) who had a primary ED diagnosis of ureteral calculus or renal colic were enrolled. Thirty (30) healthy volunteers (aged 40.8 ± 11.7 years) were recruited to serve as controls.Results: Statistical analysis showed that (1) the average electrical conductance of the patient group was statistically lower than that of the control group (p < 0.01), (2) the average index of sympathovagal balance of the patient group was statistically higher than that of the control group (p < 0.01), (3) the average coefficient of variation of the electrical conductance and index of sympathovagal balance in the patient group was statistically different from that in the control group (p < 0.01), and (4) the patients who needed intervention had a higher autonomic nervous imbalance than the patients who had spontaneous stone passage (p < 0.01).Conclusions: Measures of electrical conductance, especially the index of sympathovagal balance, may be used as valuable supplementary diagnostic methods for selective intervention in patients with acute renal colic."
"AbstractObjectives: While previous studies focused on the effectiveness of individual complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies, the value of providing patients access to an integrated program involving multiple CAM and conventional therapies remains unknown. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility and effects of a model of multidisciplinary integrative care for subacute low-back pain (LBP) in an academic teaching hospital.Design: This was a pilot randomized trial comparing an individualized program of integrative care (IC) plus usual care to usual care (UC) alone for adults with LBP.Subjects: Twenty (20) individuals with LPB of 3–12 weeks' duration were recruited from an occupational health clinic and community health center.Interventions: Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of individualized IC plus usual care versus UC alone. IC was provided by a trained multidisciplinary team offering CAM therapies and conventional medical care.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were symptoms (pain, bothersomeness), functional status (Roland-Morris score), SF-12, worry, and difficulty performing three self-selected activities.Results: Over 12 weeks, participants in the IC group had a median of 12.0 visits (range 5–25). IC participants experienced significantly greater improvements at 12 weeks than those receiving UC alone in symptom bothersomeness (p=0.02) and pain (p=0.005), and showed greater improvement in functional status (p=0.08). Rates of improvement were greater for patients in IC than UC in functional status (p=0.02), bothersomeness (p=0.002), and pain scores (p=0.001). Secondary outcomes of self-selected most challenging activity, worry, and the SF-12 also showed improvement in the IC group at 12 weeks. These differences persisted at 26 weeks, but were no longer statistically significant.Conclusions: It was feasible for a multidisciplinary, outpatient IC team to deliver coordinated, individualized intervention to patients with subacute LBP. Results showed a promising trend for benefit of treating patients with persistent LBP with this IC model, and warrant evaluation in a full-scale study."
"AbstractObjective: Stress is caused when a particular relationship between the individual and the environment emerges. Specifically, stress occurs when an individual's abilities are challenged or when one's well-being is threatened by excessive environmental demands. The aim of this study was to measure the effects of music therapy on stress in university students.Design: Randomized controlled trial.Participants: Sixty-four students were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 33) or the control group (n = 31).Intervention: Music therapy.Outcome measures: Initial measurement included cardiovascular indicators (blood pressure and pulse), autonomic nervous activity (standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals [SDNN], normalized low frequency, normalized high frequency, low/high frequency), and subjective stress. After the first measurement, participants in both groups were exposed to a series of stressful tasks, and then a second measurement was conducted. The experimental group then listened to music for 20 minutes and the control group rested for 20 minutes. A third and final measurement was then taken.Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in the first or second measurement. However, after music therapy, the experimental group and the control group showed significant differences in all variables, including systolic blood pressure (p = .026), diastolic blood pressure (p = .037), pulse (p < .001), SDNN (p = .003), normalized low frequency (p < .001), normalized high frequency (p = .010), and subjective stress (p = .026).Conclusion: Classical music tends to relax the body and may stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. These results suggest music therapy as an intervention for stress reduction."
"AbstractObjective: To demonstrate the effects of a very low-fat, vegan diet on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Design: Single-blind dietary intervention study.Subjects and study          interventions: This study evaluated the influence of a 4-week, very low-fat (~10%), vegan diet on 24 free-living subjects with RA, average age, 56 ± 11 years old.Outcome measurements:          Prestudy and poststudy assessment of RA symptomatology was performed by a rheumatologist blind to the study design. Biochemical measures and 4-day diet data were also collected. Subjects met weekly for          diet instruction, compliance monitoring, and progress assessments.Results: There were significant (p < 0.001) decreases in fat (69%), protein (24%), and energy (22%), and a significant          increase in carbohydrate (55%) intake. All measures of RA symptomatology decreased significantly (p < 0.05), except for duration of morning stiffness (p > 0.05). Weight also decreased          significantly (p < 0.001). At 4 weeks, C-reactive protein decreased 16% (ns, p > 0.05), RA factor decreased 10% (ns, p > 0.05), while erythrocyte sedimentation rate was unchanged          (p > 0.05).Conclusion: This study showed that patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who switch to a very low-fat, vegan diet can experience significant reductions in RA symptoms.

"AbstractObjectives: Geriatric depression is a major public health problem in China. The study compared the intervention and follow-up effects of aromatherapy massage and inhalation on symptoms of depression in community-dwelling older adults after an 8-week intervention.Design: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on community-dwelling adults ≥60 years old, with symptoms of depression. Participants were randomly assigned, by Latin Square, to aromatherapy massage, inhalation, or control groups (each n = 20).Interventions: The aromatherapy massage group received 30 min of aromatherapy massage with 5 mL oil, twice weekly for 8 weeks. The oil contained 50 μL (one drop) of compound essential oils (lavender [Lavandula angustifolia], sweet orange [Citrus sinensis], and bergamot (Citrus bergamia in a 2:1:1 ratio)], diluted in sweet almond oil to a concentration of 1%. The aromatherapy inhalation group received 30 min of nasal inhalation of 50 μL of the compound essential oils blended in 10 mL of purified water, twice weekly for 8 weeks. The control group received no intervention.Outcome measures: The Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used for assessment at pretest, posttest, and 6- and 10-week follow-ups in all groups. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration was assessed pretest and posttest.Results: Postintervention, the aromatherapy massage and inhalation groups demonstrated significantly lower GDS-SF and PHQ-9 scores than control participants. Compared with the pretest, the GDS-SF and PHQ-9 scores for depressive symptoms in both experimental groups remained lower at posttest (8 weeks), 6-week (14 weeks), and 10-week (18 weeks) follow-ups. However, the GDS-SF and PHQ-9 scores did not differ among the four time points in the control group. The posttest 5-HT concentrations in the aromatherapy massage and inhalation groups were increased over pretest values.Conclusions: Both aromatherapy massage and aromatherapy inhalation may have important implications for intervening depression in older adults."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to determine the possible clinical benefit of molasses-based dietary compositions (designated as MSQ 13, MSQ 15, and MSQ 18) in a case of both primary and recurrent adult AML.Design: The design was a single case study.Settings/location: The setting was in the home.Interventions: The regime of dietary compositions initially was administered as follows: MSQ-13 1tbsp t.i.d. for 1 mo, MSQ-15 2tbsp t.i.d. for 3 mo. After recurrence, MSQ-18 was taken at 2 tbsp t.i.d. for 3 mo.Outcome measures: Clinical improvement and regression of AML were the outcome measures.Conclusions: Treatment with the MSQ dietary compositions resulted in disease regression and the reversal of clinical manifestations over two episodes of AML. Therefore, further studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of this approach for the clinical management of AML."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aimed to develop an Internet-assisted smoking cessation program accompanied with auricular acupressure, and compare the quit rate and self-efficacy of youth smokers receiving auricular acupressure with and without the Internet-assisted smoking cessation program.	Design: A Website was constructed on IBM Websphere 5.0 and DB2 database using HTML, Javascript, and JSP. A quasiexperimental research design was adopted. Subjects were assigned nonrandomly to two groups. Group 1 received auricular acupressure plus the Internet-assisted smoking cessation program, whereas group 2 received auricular acupressure only.Measurements: The data of demographic factors, serum cotinine, quitting rate, nicotine dependence, and self-efficacy of subjects were collected before and after a 4-week intervention.Results: After intervention, the quit rate was 15.78% in group 1 and 2.56% in group 2. Nicotine dependence was significantly lowered in group 1, but remained unchanged in group 2. The improvement of self-efficacy between groups 1 and 2 was significantly different.Conclusions: The combination of auricular acupressure and Internet-assisted smoking cessation program was more efficacious than auricular acupressure alone in terms of quit rate."
"AbstractObjectives: The goal of this research is to design a novel model using protein folding to study Therapeutic Touch, a noncontact form of energy manipulation healing. Presented is a feasibility study suggesting that the denaturation path of ribonuclease A may be a useful model to study the energy exchange underlying therapeutic touch.Design: The folding of ribonuclease A serves as a controlled energy-requiring system in which energy manipulation can be measured by the degree of folding achieved. A kinetic assay and fluorescence spectroscopy are used to assess the enzyme-folding state.Results: The data suggest that the kinetic assay is a useful means of assessing the degree of refolding, and specifically, the enzyme function. However, fluorescence spectroscopy was not shown to be an effective measurement of enzyme structure for the purposes of this work.Conclusions: More research is needed to assess the underlying mechanism of therapeutic touch to complement the existing studies. An enzyme-folding model may provide a useful means of studying the energy exchange in therapeutic touch."
"AbstractObjectives: Although there has been much international commentary, little is known about the interface between traditional knowledge and scientific research in modern naturopathic practice. This study aimed to explore this interface from the perspective of naturopaths.Design: Semistructured interviews were conducted with naturopaths in current practice. The participants were selected using purposive sampling, and the data from the interviews were interpreted using thematic analysis.Settings/location: Interviews were conducted in a place suitable to each participant.Subjects: Twelve (12) naturopaths in current clinical practice were interviewed. The participants represented a diversity of characteristics including gender, time in practice, level of qualification, and clinical contact hours per week.Outcome measures: Thematic analysis was used to identify common themes from the interviews.Results: Analysis identified a disparity in practitioner definition of what constitutes traditional information. However, it also identified that traditional knowledge is considered a valid source of information, whereas the validity and value of modern research is questioned. There is also tension between these two information sources, with science being argued to both support traditional knowledge, while also undermining its value. This tension seems to be overcome by practitioners' use of traditional knowledge to direct their own research, as well as drawing upon their knowledge of science to explain traditional knowledge as yet not researched. Conclusions: The findings of this qualitative study reveal tensions and ambiguities around the interface between tradition and science with regard to naturopathic clinical practice. Understanding these findings may assist individuals and groups within the naturopathic profession, as well as those outside the profession engaging and collaborating with naturopaths."
"AbstractContext and objective: Guaraná (Paullinia cupana) has been used medicinally for centuries. The aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of guaraná in the treatment of postradiation depression and fatigue.Design and setting: This study had a double-blind randomized design with crossover between experimental arms, at Faculdade de Medicina da Fundação do ABC.Methods: We conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 36 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy. We randomized patients to either guaraná 75 mg daily p.o. or to placebo. Patients were switched to the other experimental arm at the middle of the radiation treatment, which consisted of 28 daily fractions of 180 cGy. Evaluations were conducted at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of radiation therapy.Results: We were unable to show any statistically significant differences between the guaraná and the placebo-treated group with any of the measured scores. Also, within the same group, we did not see any statistically significant associations during either the guaraná- or placebo-treated periods with any of the aforementioned measures.Conclusions: We were unable to show that patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy derive any advantage with guaraná over placebo for both fatigue and depressive symptoms."
"AbstractObjectives: Exposure to active mobile phones (MP) has been shown to affect human neural function as shown by the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although it has not been determined whether such effects          are harmful, a number of devices have been developed that attempt to minimize these MP-related effects. One such device, the Q Link Ally® (QL; Clarus Products, International, L.L.C., San          Rafael, CA), is argued to affect the human organism in such a way as to attenuate the effect of MPs. The present pilot study was designed to determine whether there is any indication that QL does alter          MP-related effects on the human EEG.Design: Twenty-four (24) subjects participated in a single-blind, fully counterbalanced crossover design in which subjects' resting EEG and phase-locked neural          responses to auditory stimuli were assessed under conditions of either active MP or active MP plus QL.Results: The addition of QL to the MP condition increased resting EEG in the gamma range          and did so as a function of exposure duration, and it attenuated MP-related effects in the delta and alpha range (at trend-level). The addition of the QL also affected phase-locked neural responses, with          a laterality reversal in the alpha range and an alteration to changes over time in the delta range, a reduction of the MP-related beta decrease over time at fronto-posterior sites, and a global reduction          in the gamma range that increased as a function of exposure duration. No unambiguous relations were found between these changes and either performance or psychologic state.Conclusions: This          pilot study suggests that the addition of the QL to active MP-exposure does affect neural function in humans, altering both resting EEG patterns and the evoked neural response to auditory stimuli, and that          there is a tendency for some MP-related changes to the EEG to be attenuated by the QL.

"AbstractObjective: To clarify the physical and psychological effects of head massage performed in the supine position using Ayurveda-based techniques (head treatment).Design: Twenty-four healthy female students were included in the study. Using a crossover study design, the same participants were enrolled in both the head treatment intervention group and control group. There was an interval of 1 week or more between measurements.Outcome measures: The physiologic indices measured included blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations (high frequency and low frequency/high frequency). The psychological markers measured included liveliness, depression, and boredom using the visual analogue scale method. State anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory method.Results: The parasympathetic nerve activity increased immediately after head treatment. Upon completion of head treatment, the parasympathetic nerve predominance tended to gradually ease. Head treatment boosted freshness and relieved anxiety.Conclusions: The results suggest that head treatment has a relaxing and refreshing effect and may be used to provide comfort."
"AbstractObjective: There are an increasing number of clinics providing integrative health care using new and innovative delivery models. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively          evaluate the Integrative Care Program offered at the Tzu Chi Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.Design: At enrollment, data are collected          on demographics, health history, current health concerns and diagnoses, quality of life/health status (SF-36) and patient satisfaction. The measures are repeated 6 months into the program. Descriptive analysis          was used to summarize the data. Focus groups were also included as part of the study design.Results: Patients seeking integrative care are a highly complex population living with numerous comorbid          chronic conditions. Although their baseline scores on the SF-36 are lower than Canadian population norms across all subscales, significant improvement occurred from baseline to 6 months. Qualitative data          support that patients were pleased with the clinical care they received and aligned with the philosophical underpinnings of the program.Discussion: This is one of the first studies to evaluate          integrative health care. Studies like this are needed to develop appropriate methods to assess models of integrative health care delivery.      "
"AbstractBackground: In the medical and scientific literature, there is a dearth of reports about how acupuncturists work and deliver care in practice. An informed characterization of the treatment process is needed to support the appropriate design of evaluative studies in acupuncture.Methods: The design was that of a nested qualitative study within a pragmatic clinical trial. Six acupuncturists who treated up to 25 patients each were interviewed after the treatment phase of the trial to obtain an account of their experiences of providing acupuncture care to patients with low back pain referred by their GP. Using semistructured interviews and a topic guide, data were collected and analyzed for both a priori and emergent themes. This paper focuses on practitioners’ accounts of the goals and processes of care, and describes the strategies employed in addition to needling and other hands-on treatments.Results: From the interview data, it is clear that a coherent body of theoretical knowledge informed clinical decisions and practice, and that the goals of treatment went beyond the alleviation of immediate pain-related symptoms. Acupuncturists in this study all described a pattern of patient-centered care based on a therapeutic partnership. Study participants confirmed the importance of three processes that characterized acupuncture care in this trial, each contributing to the goal of a positive long-term outcome; building a therapeutic relationship; individualizing care; and facilitating the active engagement of patients in their own recovery. Acupuncturists described elements of care that characterized these processes including establishing rapport, facilitating communication throughout the period of care, using an interactive diagnostic process, matching treatment to the individual patient, and the use of explanatory models from Chinese medicine to aid the development of a shared understanding of the patient’s condition and to motivate lifestyle changes that reinforce the potential for a recovery of health. Acupuncturists did not view these therapeutic goals, processes, and strategies as a departure from their usual practice.Conclusions: This study suggests that acupuncture care for patients with chronic conditions such as low back pain is likely to be a complex intervention that utilizes a number of patient-centered strategies to elicit longterm therapeutic benefits. Research designed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as it is practiced in the UK needs to accommodate the full range of therapeutic goals and related treatment processes."
"AbstractObjective: Therapeutic massage has demonstrated positive physical and emotional benefits to offset the effects of treatments associated with breast cancer. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of therapeutic massage on the quality of life of patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer.Design: Using a pre/post intervention assessment design, this prospective, convenience sample pilot study measured anxiety, pain, nausea, sleep quality, and quality of life. Treatment consisted of one 30-minute treatment per week for 3 consecutive weeks.Outcome measures: Instruments selected for this study were used in previous massage therapy studies to measure quality of life/health status and have documented validity and reliability.Results: Participants experienced a reduction in several quality of life symptom concerns after only 3 weeks of massage therapy. Respondents' cumulative pre- and post-massage mean for state anxiety, sleep quality, and quality of life/functioning showed significant improvement. Among study participants, there was variability in reported episodes of nausea, vomiting, and retching; although participants reported decreased pain and distress, changes were non-significant.Conclusions: Therapeutic massage shows potential benefits for ameliorating the effects of breast cancer treatment by reducing side affects of chemotherapy and radiation and improving perceived quality of life and overall functioning."
"AbstractObjectives: The objectives of this study were to explore the association between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use as reported by youth, and parents' and children's reported quality of life in youth with diabetes.Design: The study design was a cross-sectional survey.Setting: Youth in Washington State participated in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, a national, multisite epidemiological study designed to assess the prevalence and incidence of diabetes in U.S. youth. Surveys assessing CAM utilization were mailed in January and April 2006.Participants: One thousand four hundred and thirty-nine (1439) youth were mailed a CAM survey. The final sample consisted of 467 youth with both CAM survey results and quality-of-life data.Outcome measures: Difference in mean scores on Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) between CAM users and nonusers overall, and specific CAM therapies were the outcome measures.Results: Of the 1439 participants approached, 587 (40.8%) returned the CAM survey. In adjusted analyses, children reported any CAM use as associated with more barriers to treatment (difference in mean scores −3.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] −6.65, −0.31). Children following a CAM diet reported higher quality of life (PedsQL Core Total difference 4.01, 95% CI [0.10–7.91]; Core Psychosocial difference was 6.45, 95% CI [1.95 to 10.95]), but those using stress-reduction activities reported poorer quality of life (Diabetes Total difference −4.19, 95% CI [−8.35 to −0.04]). Parent-reported quality of life was lower for children who used “other supplements” (Core Total difference −6.26, 95% CI [−11.29 to −1.24]; Core Psychosocial difference was −5.92, 95% CI [−11.65 to −0.19]).Conclusions: CAM diets were associated with increased quality of life in youth with diabetes, whereas supplement use and stress-reduction activities were associated with decreased quality of life. The temporal sequence between CAM use and quality of life requires further study."
"AbstractBackground and objectives: Patient preferences play an important role when choosing between different treatment options and may have an influence on outcome. We performed a study to investigate (1)          to what extent patients make use of the offer to receive acupuncture as a pretreatment for gastroscopy, (2) whether this is perceived as being as effective as sedation, and (3) whether characteristics and          outcomes differ between patients giving consent to random allocation and patients choosing their pretreatment.Design: Partially randomized patient preference trial. Patients who gave consent          to randomization were allocated randomly while patients who had a preference received the treatment of their choice.Patients: One hundred and six (106) inpatients of a district hospital in southern          Germany undergoing gastroscopy for diagnostic purposes.Interventions: Pretreatment with a sedative (midazolam) or acupuncture.Main outcome measure: Patient's overall assessment on          a visual analogue scale (VAS).Results: Twenty-eight (28) patients (26%) agreed to be randomized, 21 (20%) chose acupuncture, 51 (47%) midazolam, and 8 (7%) did not want pretreatment. Patients          receiving midazolam rated the examination as slightly less troublesome than those receiving acupuncture. Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate were significantly lower in patients receiving          midazolam. Characteristics and outcomes of randomized and nonrandomized patients did not differ significantly.Conclusions: Because of the low number of patients giving consent to random allocation          conclusions on effectiveness are difficult to draw. The partially randomized patient preference design is recommended for use in future trials of acupuncture for gastroscopy. Such trials should be performed          in an outpatient setting.      "
"AbstractObjectives: This prospective long-term study examines the effects of a Pilates training intervention on spinal mobility, disease activity, and functional capacity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).Design: The study design was quasi experimental and single blind.Subjects: 11 subjects were recruited among patients undergoing followup of AS diagnosed according to modified New York criteria at the rheumatology clinic.Interventions: Over a 12-month period, 11 patients completed a training program consisting of two sessions per week of selected Pilates exercises. There was no control group.Outcome measures: The primary outcome variable was functional capacity measured using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) questionnaire. Exploratory outcome measures were Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), and chest expansion and fingertip-to-floor (FTF) test. Baseline and follow-up examinations were performed immediately before the intervention and during the course of treatment at 4, 8, and 12 months.Results: After the exercise intervention, improvements were observed in BASFI (77.51%), BASDAI (64.39%) and BASMI (58.95%) scores, FTF distance (71.92%), and chest expansion (88.74%).Conclusions: These findings suggest that Pilates training could be useful in AS patients and provide direction for larger controlled trials designed to determine the therapeutic benefits of Pilates in the management of these patients."
"AbstractThis paper describes what a primary care-based optimal healing environment (OHE) might look like for chronic low-back pain, and presents a research protocol to evaluate the effect of such an environment on a variety of important patient and clinician outcomes. Such an environment may be conceived of as having three major components: (1) the health care environment in which the primary care team works; (2) the cognitive, technical, clinical and organizational skills of the team, and; (3) the ""healing"" skills of the team members, particularly the primary care physician. A variety of study designs available for evaluating the effects of an OHE on patient and clinical outcomes are described. Decisions about study site and population, appropriate outcome measures, required sample sizes, methods of patient recruitment, treatment protocol and analytic issues would need to be tailored to the specific requirements of the study. Because many elements of an OHE designed for chronic back pain seen in primary care settings would also be relevant for the other 98% of primary care visits, it is preferable to design, implement and evaluate an OHE for primary care practice in general than for only a specific condition."
"AbstractIntroduction: An important methodological challenge encountered in acupuncture clinical research involves the design of treatment protocols that help ensure standardization and replicability while          allowing for the necessary flexibility to tailor treatments to each individual. Manualization of protocols used in clinical trials of acupuncture and other traditionally-based complementary and alternative          medicine (CAM) systems facilitates the systematic delivery of replicable and standardized, yet individually-tailored treatments.Objectives: To facilitate high-quality CAM acupuncture research          by outlining a method for the systematic design and implementation of protocols used in CAM clinical trials based on the concept of treatment manualization.Methods: A series of treatment manuals          was developed to systematically articulate the Chinese medical theoretical and clinical framework for a given Western-defined illness, to increase the quality and consistency of treatment, and to standardize          the technical aspects of the protocol. In all, three manuals were developed for National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded clinical trials of acupuncture for depression, spasticity in cerebral palsy, and          repetitive stress injury. In Part I, the rationale underlying these manuals and the challenges encountered in creating them are discussed, and qualitative assessments of their utility are provided. In Part          II, a methodology to develop treatment manuals for use in clinical trials is detailed, and examples are given.Conclusions: A treatment manual provides a precise way to train and supervise practitioners,          enable evaluation of conformity and competence, facilitate the training process, and increase the ability to identify the active therapeutic ingredients in clinical trials of acupuncture.

"AbstractPurpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Urban Zen Initiative, an “optimal healing environment” intervention, at Beth Israel Medical Center on both quantitative and qualitative measures of the experience of patients admitted for inpatient oncology care.Materials and methods: A quasi-experimental design was used comparing a baseline sample of patients admitted to the oncology floor before the intervention to a similar group admitted during the intervention. Data collected included the Profile of Mood States, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and, on a subset of patients, a semistructured qualitative interview.Results: Patients in the intervention group experienced significantly less emotional distress during their stay when compared to patients in the baseline group. There were also significantly greater improvements in pain and discomfort during the stay in the treatment group as compared to controls. The qualitative analysis described a number of possible explanations for this change including increased sense of connection and control as well as specific techniques for symptom relief.Conclusions: It is possible to improve the experience of patients admitted for inpatient cancer care with a “healing environment” intervention. Further studies are needed that incorporate randomized design and the ability to examine specific components of the intervention independently as well as the impact of the intervention as a whole."
"AbstractObjectives: This study evaluated the change in the concerns, wellbeing, and lifestyle behaviors of informal caregivers of people with cancer attending Penny Brohn UK's Living Well Course (LWC), a self-management education intervention.Design: A pre–postcourse design collected self-reported quantitative and qualitative data from informal caregivers attending a LWC.Setting/Location: Penny Brohn UK is a United Kingdom-based charity (not-for-profit) providing specialist integrative, whole person support, free of charge, to people affected by cancer.Subjects: Informal caregivers taking part in a Penny Brohn UK LWC between June 2014 and May 2016 attending alongside the person with cancer.Intervention: The LWC is a structured 15 h, multimodal group self-management educational course, designed to help people affected by cancer learn tools and techniques to help build resilience. Trained facilitators deliver LWCs to around 12 people with various types and stages of cancer and their informal caregivers.Outcome measures: Measure Yourself Concern and Wellbeing (MYCaW) completed precourse and at 6 weeks postcourse; and bespoke 6-week follow-up Patient Reported Experience Measure.Results: Four hundred eighty informal caregivers attended a LWC June 2014 to May 2016. One hundred eighteen completed a 6-week follow-up MYCaW: MYCaW Concerns 1 and 2 showed statistically significant improvements (p < 0.0001), there was no significant improvement in wellbeing. Informal caregivers' most reported concerns relating to themselves were psychological and emotional issues (59%). The primary concern of the caregiver for the care recipient was related to the physical health of the person with cancer (40%). Eighty-seven percent of responding informal caregivers stated that the LWC enabled health self-management.Conclusions: The LWC was followed by an improvement in informal caregivers' concerns, and increased self-management of their own health needs. More studies, with larger sample size, are needed to explore if better self-management by informal caregivers may also lead to improvements in patients' health and wellbeing."
"AbstractObjective: Findings of existing functional MRI (fMRI) studies on the neural mechanisms that mediate effects of acupuncture analgesia are inconsistent. This study analyzes the effects of manual acupuncture on pain ratings and brain activation in response to experimental, electrical pain stimuli.Design: Fourteen healthy volunteers were examined by using a 1.5-T MRI scanner. The intensity of pain stimuli was adjusted to individual pain ratings on a numeric rating scale. Baseline fMRI was performed during electrical pain stimulation in a blocked design. For the second session, manual acupuncture with repeated stimulation was performed on contralateral acupoints—large intestine 4, liver 3, and stomach 36—before imaging. After imaging, subjective pain ratings and ratings of the de qi sensation were assessed.Results: Compared with baseline, volunteers showed modulated brain activity under pain conditions in the cingulate gyrus, insula, primary somatosensory cortex, and prefrontal areas after the acupuncture session. In accordance with the literature, anterior insular and prefrontal activity seemed to be correlated with acupuncture treatment.Conclusion: This study supports the existence of analgesic acupuncture effects that outlast the needling period. Pain-associated brain areas were modulated in direct response to a preceding acupuncture treatment."
"AbstractPurpose: The purpose of this study is to examine and compare health status across ages using a volunteer sample of U.S. Taijiquan and Qigong (TQG) practitioners (N=120; age range=24–83, M=54.77) and a nationally representative sample (N=414,629; age range=18–99, M=54.86) collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Design: The study design was cross-sectional, between-group comparisons.Methods: An online survey designed to collect data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), lifestyle variables, and TQG practice regimens was administered to a volunteer sample of taijiquan practitioners. A link to the survey was e-mailed to registrants of the International T'ai Chi Symposium who further forwarded (snowballed) the link to other practitioners across the country and around the world. The HRQoL and demographic sections of the survey were adapted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Taiji practitioner data and BRFSS data were then merged and three groups—No Exercise, Some Exercise, and TQG Exercise—were created for the analysis. Health status was regressed on age, exercise group membership, and the interaction between age and group membership while controlling for income and education.Results: After controlling for the effects of income and education, a significant interaction effect (p<0.001) was detected between age and group membership. Group membership was not a substantial predictor of health among younger individuals, but among older adults, substantive and significant between-group differences appeared, with the TQG group evincing the best average health trajectory across ages.Conclusions: Although this cross-sectional comparison cannot establish causality or rule out cohort effects, the extraordinary trajectory of health status among TQG practitioners in this U.S. sample is significantly better than average exercising and nonexercising U.S. Americans, even while controlling for the influence of income and education levels. Lifespan developmental theory is utilized to consider several factors beyond the physical exercise value of TQG that may be responsible for the exercise group differences."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementation with a spearmint (Mentha spicata L.) extract, high in polyphenols including rosmarinic acid, on cognitive performance, sleep, and mood in individuals with age-associated memory impairment (AAMI).Design: Subjects with AAMI (N = 90; 67% female; age = 59.4 ± 0.6 years) were randomly assigned (n = 30/group) to consume 900, 600, or 0 mg/day (two capsules, once daily) spearmint extract for 90 days, in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Assessments were completed for cognition (days 0, 45, and 90), sleep (days 0 and 90), and mood (days 0 and 90) by using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System™, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), and Profile of Mood States (POMS™), respectively.Results: Quality of working memory and spatial working memory accuracy improved after supplementation with 900 mg/day spearmint extract by 15% (p = 0.0469) and 9% (p = 0.0456), respectively, versus placebo. Subjects consuming 900 mg/day spearmint extract reported improvement in their ability to fall asleep, relative to subjects consuming placebo (p = 0.0046). Overall treatment effects were evident for vigor-activity (p = 0.0399), total mood disturbance (p = 0.0374), and alertness and behavior following wakefulness (p = 0.0415), with trends observed for improvements after spearmint supplementation relative to placebo.Conclusions: These results suggest that the distinct spearmint extract may be a beneficial nutritional intervention for cognitive health in older subjects with AAMI."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to compare changes in brain γ-aminobutyric (GABA) levels associated with an acute yoga session versus a reading session. It was hypothesized that an individual yoga session would be associated with an increase in brain GABA levels.Design: This is a parallel-groups design.Settings/location: Screenings, scan acquisitions, and interventions took place at medical school–affiliated centers.Subjects: The sample comprised 8 yoga practitioners and 11 comparison subjects.Interventions: Yoga practitioners completed a 60-minute yoga session and comparison subjects completed a 60-minute reading session.Outcome measures: GABA-to-creatine ratios were measured in a 2-cm axial slab using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging immediately prior to and immediately after interventions.Results: There was a 27% increase in GABA levels in the yoga practitioner group after the yoga session (0.20 mmol/kg) but no change in the comparison subject group after the reading session ( −0.001 mmol/kg) (t = −2.99, df = 7.87, p = 0.018).Conclusions:These findings demonstrate that in experienced yoga practitioners, brain GABA levels increase after a session of yoga. This suggests that the practice of yoga should be explored as a treatment for disorders with low GABA levels such as depression and anxiety disorders. Future studies should compare yoga to other forms of exercise to help determine whether yoga or exercise alone can alter GABA levels. "
"AbstractObjective: To determine whether a course of Feldenkrais bodywork would result in significant improvement in physical, mood symptoms and functioning in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients beyond the effects observed using a sham condition (nontherapeutic bodywork).Design: The bodywork method used was the Feldenkrais method. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups in a crossover design to control for order effects of treatment. Half of the subjects received 8 weeks of sham sessions followed by 8 weeks of Feldenkrais sessions. The other half of the subjects received Feldenkrais sessions first and then sham. All subjects completed the outcome measures prior to the first course of treatment, in between Feldenkrais and sham, and at study completion.Setting: Participants were recruited from a regional MS clinic and were administered bodywork treatment and outcome measures in a bodywork practitioner's office.Subjects: Twenty individuals with clinically definite MS and disability status scores between 2.0 and 6.0 participated.Outcome measures: Nine-hole pegboard test of hand dexterity. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, MS self-efficacy scale, MS Symptom Inventory, MS Performance Scales, and the Perceived Stress Scale.Results: The only significant differences were observed for perceived stress and lowered anxiety after Feldenkrais sessions. There were nonsignificant trends toward higher self-efficacy after both Feldenkrais and sham sessions. MS symptoms, levels of functional ability, and upper extremity performance were not affected by Feldenkrais or sham sessions."
"AbstractObjectives: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of Healing Touch (HT) on variables assumed to be related to health enhancement; (2) to determine whether practitioner training level moderates          treatment effectiveness.Design: Mixed-method repeated measures design with quasi-experimental and naturalistic approaches, paired with nomothetic and idiographic analyses.Setting/Location:          Practitioner's offices or client's home.Subjects: Twenty-two (22) clients who had never experienced HT.Interventions: Three treatment conditions: no treatment (NT), HT only (standard          HT care), and HT+ (Standard HT care plus music plus guided imagery).Outcome measures: Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentrations in saliva, self-reports of stress levels, client perceptions          of health enhancement, and qualitative questionnaires about individual effects.Results: Clients of practitioners with more training experienced statistically significant positive sIgA change          over the HT treatment series, while clients of practitioners with less experience did not. Clients reported a statistically significant reduction of stress level after both HT conditions. Perceived enhancement          of health was reported by 13 of 22 clients (59%). Themes of relaxation, connection, and enhanced awareness were identified in the qualitative analysis of the HT experience. Pain relief was reported by 6          of 11 clients (55%) experiencing pain.Conclusions: The data support the clinical effectiveness of HT in health enhancement, specifically for raising sIgA concentrations, lowering stress perceptions          and relieving pain. The evidence indicates that positive responses were not exclusively as a result of placebo, that is, client beliefs, expectations, and behaviors regarding HT.      "
"AbstractObjective: To examine the effects of a 12-week therapeutic yoga program on gait speed, postural control, and mobility in community-dwelling older adults.Design: Quasi-experimental study with a pretest/post-test design. Researchers evaluated changes over time (pretest to post-test) in all outcome measures. Paired t-tests were used to analyze normal and fast gait speed, Timed Up and Go test, and Timed Up and Go Dual Task. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate scores for the Mini-BESTest (MBT).Setting: Yoga classes were performed at a local senior center. Blind examiners who were previously trained in the outcome measures performed all pretests and post-tests at the site.Participants: Thirteen adults (12 women and 1 man, with a mean age±standard deviation of 72±6.9 years) completed the study. Research participants had minimal to no yoga experience.Interventions: A 12-week, 60-minute, biweekly Kripalu yoga class designed specifically for community-dwelling older adults.Outcome measures: Postural control (MBT), mobility (Timed Up and Go test), and gait speed (normal and fast) were assessed.Results: All 13 participants attended at least 19 of the 24 classes (80% attendance). Statistically significant improvements were seen in the MBT (p=0.039), normal gait speed (p=0.015), fast gait speed (p=0.001), Timed Up and Go test (p=0.045), and Timed Up and Go Dual-Task (p=0.05).Conclusions: Improvements in postural control and mobility as measured by the MBT and Timed Up and Go gait as measured by fast gait speed indicate that research participants benefitted from the therapeutic yoga intervention. The yoga program designed for this study included activities in standing, sitting, and lying on the floor and may be effective in improving mobility, postural control, and gait speed in community-dwelling older adults."
"AbstractObjectives: Decreased quality of life in diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes. Far-infrared sauna treatments improve the quality of life for those with chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and congestive heart failure. The objective of this study is to determine whether far-infrared saunas have a beneficial effect on quality of life in those with type II diabetes.Design: This was a sequential, longitudinal, interrupted time series design study.Setting/location: The setting was Fraser Lake BC, a rural village in central British Columbia, Canada.Subjects: All patients of the Fraser Lake Community Health Center with type II diabetes were invited to participate in this study.Interventions: The study consisted of 20-minute, 3 times weekly infrared sauna sessions, over a period of 3 months.Outcome measures: To assess quality of life, subjects completed the 36-item Short-form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) questionnaire as well as “Zero-to-Ten” Visual Analogue Scales. Baseline study parameters were measured within 1 week prior to commencing sauna sessions. Postintervention measurements were collected between 1 and 3 days after the last sauna session.Results: Physical health, general health, and social functioning indices of the SF-36v2 improved. Visual Analogue Scales for stress and fatigue improved.Conclusions: Far-infrared sauna use maybe associated with improved quality of life in people with type II diabetes mellitus. Uptake of infrared saunas use is greater than the uptake of other lifestyle interventions."
"AbstractObjective: To provide a descriptive overview of the clinical trials assessing meditation practices for health care.Design: Systematic review of the literature. Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic bibliographic databases through September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contacting experts, and gray literature searches. Included studies were clinical trials with 10 or more adult participants using any meditation practice, providing quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies.Results: Four hundred clinical trials on meditation (72% described as randomized) were included in the review (publication years 1956–2005). Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified: mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, yoga, t'ai chi, and qigong. The three most studied clinical conditions were hypertension, miscellaneous cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Psychosocial measures were the most frequently reported outcomes. Outcome measures of psychiatric and psychological symptoms dominate the outcomes of interest. Overall, the methodological quality of clinical trials is poor, but has significantly improved over time by 0.014 points every year (95% CI, 0.005, 0.023).Conclusions: Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed. Despite a statistically significant improvement in the methodological quality over time, it is imperative that future trials on meditation be rigorous in design, execution, analysis, and the reporting of results."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to compare religious characteristics of general internists, rheumatologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists, as well as to examine associations between physicians' religious characteristics and their openness to integrating complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).Design: The design involved a national mail survey. The subjects were internists, rheumatologists, naturopaths, and acupuncturists.Measures: Physician outcome measures were use of and attitudes toward six classes of CAM. Predictors were religious affiliation, intrinsic religiosity, spirituality, and religious traditionalism.Results: There was a 65% response. Naturopaths and acupuncturists were three times as likely as internists and rheumatologists to report no religious affiliation (35% versus 12%, p < 0.001), but were more likely to describe themselves as very spiritual (51% versus 20%, p < 0.001) and to agree they try to carry religious beliefs into life's dealings (51% versus 44%, p < 0.01). Among physicians, increased spirituality and religiosity coincided with more personal use of CAM and willingness to integrate CAM into a treatment program.Conclusions: Current and future integrative medicine will be shaped in part by religious and spiritual characteristics of providers."
"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical application of Herbavate® cream (Troikaa Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Ahmedabad, India), a polyherbal formulation in the management of outpatients with eczema.Design: This was an open label design.Subjects and setting: One hundred and fifty (150) outpatients with a clinical diagnosis of eczema and meeting the eligibility criteria used topical Herbavate twice daily for 4 weeks. Change in symptom score for eczema (erythema, scaling, thickening, and itching) was assessed weekly using a 4-point score. The trial was carried out at Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, Seth V.S. Hospital, Ahmedabad, and Stanley Medical College, Chennai.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was a change in symptom score at 4 weeks as compared to baseline scores. The secondary outcome measure was a weekly change in symptom score as compared to the previous visit. Local tolerance was judged by development of side effects at site of application.Results: Clinical improvement in symptom score at the end of study as compared to baseline was significant for all symptoms assessed (p < 0.001). Significant reduction in symptoms scores was observed from end of week 1. Local tolerance was good, with only 5 patients reporting side effects that improved with continued use. No patient withdrew due to side effects.Conclusions: Herbavate, a topical polyherbal formulation, appears to an attractive alternate option for the management of outpatients with eczema."
"AbstractObjectives: To investigate whether stimulation of the auricular sympathetic acupuncture point would affect the mean maximum amplitude of evoked sudomotor responses. Design: A placebo-controlled trial. Two types of controls were used: no acupuncture and acupuncture of an alternate “non-sympathetic nervous system” related (ie, a non-sympathetic, placebo) point. Subjects were included in either the placebo or the test group. Each subject would have one session of acupuncture and one session without acupuncture, the acupuncture was applied in either the first or the second session. Initially, each group was unaware in which of the two sessions they would receive acupuncture (cross-over design). Each individual was unaware of which group they were to participate in. Settings/location: A quiet, sealed room with a constant temperature, in the research department of the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic. Subjects: Thirty-eight asymptomatic male, white volunteers (18 to 40 years old). Interventions: The two groups underwent two electrodermal response (EDR) recording sessions, at an interval of 5 weeks. During each session, they were also presented with eight stimuli, each of which was designed to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. In each session, subjects either received auricular acupuncture (AA) or did not. Outcome measures: The maximum amplitude of the EDR for each stimulus. Results: AA at the non-sympathetic, placebo point significantly increased EDR both with respect to the individual stimuli (p ≤ 0.05 to ≤ 0.001) and for the pooled data (p = 0.0001). AA to the sympathetic point produced no significant change in EDR for either individual stimuli (p range ≥ 0.8 to ≥ 0.1) or for the pooled data (p > 0.8). A significant difference was found between the results from placebo and sympathetic point stimulated groups during AA for 2 of the 8 stimuli (p < 0.05), and for the pooled data from all 8 stimuli (p = 0.0006). Conclusion: Stimulation of the sympathetic AA point significantly decreased the stimulus-evoked EDR when compared with an AA stimulation to a non-sympathetic (placebo) point. However, it did not significantly alter EDR compared with no treatment. This implies that the increase in response as a result of inserting the needles was negated by placing the electrodes in the AA sympathetic point. Consequently, one might surmise that there may be a specific action of AA in respect to hyperhidrosis resulting from an increase in sympathetic activity."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aims to explore the treatment interventions complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) practitioners use in the management of an emerging health condition, increased intestinal permeability (IP), and the association these methods have on the observed time to resolve this condition.Design and setting: A cross-sectional survey of Australian naturopaths, nutritionists, and Western herbal medicine practitioners was undertaken (n = 227) through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) network.Outcome measures: Frequencies and percentages of the treatment methods, including chi-square analysis to examine the associations between treatment methods and observed time to resolve IP.Results: Thirty-six CIM practitioners responded to the survey (response rate 15.9%). CIM practitioners were found to use a multimodal approach in the management of IP with 92.6% of respondents using three or more categories of treatment interventions (nutritional, herbal, dietary, and lifestyle) with a mean total of 43.0 ± 24.89 single treatment interventions frequently prescribed. The main treatments prescribed in the management of IP were zinc (85.2%), probiotics: multistrain (77.8%), vitamin D (75.0%), glutamine (73.1%), Curcuma longa (73.1%), and Saccharomyces boulardii (70.4%). CIM practitioners also advocate patients with IP to reduce alcohol (96.3%), gluten (85.2%), and dairy (75.0%) consumption. Evaluation of antibiotics (75.0%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (73.1%) prescriptions were frequently advised by CIM practitioners. A longer observed time to resolve IP was seen in CIM practitioners who did not reduce intense exercise in the management of IP (p = 0.02).Conclusions: This study represents the first survey of the treatments prescribed by CIM practitioners for IP and suggests that CIM practitioners use numerous integrative treatment methods for the management of IP. The treatment interventions frequently prescribed by CIM practitioners align with preclinical research, suggesting that CIM practitioners prescribe in accordance with the published literature. The findings of this study contribute to the implementation of clinical research in the management of IP, which considers multiple concurrent treatments."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of manual acupuncture on experimental pain parameters in healthy participants.Design: The experimental design was a repeated-measures, three-group pre- and postprocedure. All subjects participated in a control, sham, and acupuncture procedure, separated by 1 week, in a counterbalanced sequence to forestall an order effect.Settings/location: Data were collected in a laboratory environment.Subjects: The participants included 12 healthy young men (mean age 21.3 ± 2.6 years; height 183.8 ± 5 cm; weight 77.7 ± 9.5 kg).Interventions: The control procedure comprised assessing the experimental pain parameters before and after a quiet rest for 20 minutes. The sham procedure was performed with the needle inserted bilaterally 1–1.5 cm outside each acupoint. The manual acupuncture procedure was performed at two bilateral acupoints of LI–4 (Large Intestine 4, Hegu) and ST-44 (Stomach 44, Nei Ting).Outcome measures: Pain parameters assessed included the pain threshold, nociceptive reflex threshold, and nociceptive reflex amplitude.Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance between pre- and postcontrol, sham, and acupuncture procedures for pain threshold, nociceptive reflex threshold, and nociceptive reflex amplitude revealed no significant difference.Conclusions: Manual acupuncture at bilateral acupoints LI–4 and ST–44 did not show a change in pain threshold, nociceptive flexion reflex threshold, or the nociceptive reflex amplitude in healthy participants."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether two different locations in the same room as tested by dowsers (“geopathic stress zone” [GSZ] versus “more neutral zone” [NZ]) would show significant short-term effects on work performance and well-being. It was also tested whether a device reported to “neutralize” GSZ would influence results obtained with the specific setup used in this study.Design: This was a blinded, randomized, short-term laboratory experiment using a within-subject design.Setting: The study was conducted in the laboratory of the Research Institute for Frontier Questions of Medicine and Biotechnology at Salzburg Federal Hospital.Subjects: The subjects were 26 persons, aged 20–57.Interventions: Participants had to accomplish reaction tasks during three different conditions: GSZ, NZ, and GSZ with a device reported to “neutralize” GSZ. These conditions were counterbalanced into six different sequences and randomized to the subjects. At the end of each condition, a standardized well-being questionnaire had to be completed.Main outcome measures: Dependent variables were reactive stress tolerance (reaction time, timely right answers, right answers, false answers, left out) and well-being (described by six adjectives).Main results: No location-dependent effects on performance during reactive stress tolerance test were seen. For well-being, analysis of variance revealed a trend (p = 0.07) and showed significantly poorer well-being during the GSZ condition compared to NZ (p = 0.01).Conclusions: This study shows that well-being can be location dependent and that this might be caused by a so-called GSZ. However, in our short-term experiment, factors of work performance tested remained unaffected."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of massage on neuromuscular recruitment, mood state, and mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) after high-intensity exercise.Design: This was a prospective randomized clinical trial using between-groups design.Setting: The study was conducted at a university-based sports medicine clinic.Participants: Sixty-two (62) healthy active students age 18–26 participated.Interventions: Participants, randomized into two groups, performed three 30-second Wingate tests and immediately received whole-body massage-myofascial induction or placebo (sham ultrasound/magnetotherapy) treatment. The duration (40 minutes), position, and therapist were the same for both treatments.Main outcome measures: Dependent variables were surface electromyography (sEMG) of quadriceps, profile of mood states (POMS) and mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) of trapezius and masseter muscles. These data were assessed at baseline and after exercise and recovery periods.Results: Generalized estimating equations models were performed on dependent variables to assess differences between groups. Significant differences were found in effects of treatment on sEMG of Vastus Medialis (VM) (p = 0.02) and vigor subscale (p = 0.04). After the recovery period, there was a significant decrease in electromyographic (EMG) activity of VM (p = 0.02) in the myofascial-release group versus a nonsignificant increase in the placebo group (p = 0.32), and a decrease in vigor (p < 0.01) in the massage group versus no change in the placebo group (p = 0.86).Conclusions: Massage reduces EMG amplitude and vigor when applied as a passive recovery technique after a high-intensity exercise protocol. Massage may induce a transient loss of muscle strength or a change in the muscle fiber tension–length relationship, influenced by alterations of muscle function and a psychological state of relaxation."
"AbstractObjectives: Many providers of Ayurvedic massage treatments make unsubstantiated claims regarding their potential psychologic and physiologic benefits. While these claims are based on ancient traditions of the Indian medical system as well as personal experience, no attempt had yet been made to verify the effect of Ayurvedic oil massage within the Western-scientific context. This pilot study assessed the single-dose effect of Abhyanga, the classic Ayurvedic oil massage, in terms of its impact on subjective stress experience.Design: Ten (10) healthy women (mean [M] 36.4 years, standard deviation [SD] 4.62) and 10 healthy men (M 37.0 years, SD 3.23) underwent a 1-hour Abhyanga massage treatment. The study employed a repeated-measures design for the collection of stress data using a validated and published questionnaire, as well as for the collection of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) values, immediately pre- and postintervention.Results:Subjects showed high statistically and clinically significant reductions in subjective stress experience. A consequent analysis of physiologic data indicated likewise reductions in HR, while a BP reduction was not recorded for the total sample, but was only found in the prehypertensive subgroup.Conclusions: Findings indicate that Abhyanga massage is promising in reducing subjective stress experience. It may be beneficial in lowering HR in all, and BP in prehypertensive subjects. The results of this pilot study encourage further research with more stringent methodology."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of meridian acupressure massage on body composition, edema, stress, and fatigue in postpartum women.Design: A quasi-experimental design with a nonequivalent control group was utilized.Settings/Location: The Postpartum Care Center of Women's Hospital in Gwangju City, Republic of Korea.Subjects: The study group consisted of 39 postpartum women, 19 in the experimental group and 20 in the control group, recruited from the postpartum care center of Women's Hospital in Gwangju city, South Korea.Interventions: The experimental group was provided with meridian acupressure massage for 90 min daily over 5 days as an experimental therapy.Outcome measures: Body composition (body weight, BMI, total body water, ECW ratio, LBM, and body fat) Edema (subjective edema, average girth of the upper limbs, and average girth of the lower limbs), Stress (psychological stress and physical stress), and Fatigue.Results: The experimental group demonstrated a significantly larger decrease compared with the control group in measures of body composition, edema, total subjective stress, psychological stress, and subjective fatigue.Conclusions: Meridian acupressure massage can hasten the return to original body composition after childbirth."
"AbstractObjectives: It is unclear whether osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) affects gastric myoelectric activity (GMA), an index of gastric motility. We hypothesized that OMT significantly alters power spectral density (PSD) analyses of electrogastrography (EGG) recordings, an index of GMA, compared with time control OMT.Design: GMA data were obtained from nine subjects before and after OMT and time control on separate days in a cross-over design. Fifteen-minute EGG recordings were obtained before and after each intervention and after a water challenge (WC). Percent power in the normogastric range (PPN) was estimated from PSD analyses. Absolute percent change of PPN and dominant frequency (DF) from baseline to postintervention and baseline to post-WC was computed and compared using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA.Results: OMT altered PPN versus time control (time control: 5.3% ± 1.2%; OMT: 24.5% ± 4.5%; p = 0.015). WC altered PPN compared with time control (post-time control ΔPPN: 5.3% ± 1.2%; post-drink ΔPPN: 30.3% ± 7.2%; p < 0.01). However, WC did not alter PPN with prior OMT treatment (post-OMT ΔPPN: 24.5% ± 4.5%; post-WC ΔPPN: 19.4% ± 5.6%; p = 0.47). Nevertheless, OMT reduced the rate of change for DF compared with time control (WC post-time control: 37.9% ± 7.4%; WC post-OMT: 20.0% ± 5.9%; p = 0.02).Conclusions: We conclude that (1) OMT significantly alters GMA compared with time control and that (2) OMT reduces the rate of change in the frequency response to WC within the normal frequency range of 2–4 cycles per minute, indicating a physiological effect."
"AbstractBackground: Insomnia is the most common of all sleep complaints and is under-researched. The current treatments of choice are conventional hypnotics agents, but these have potential for serious adverse reactions. Uncontrolled and anecdotal evidence suggests that lavender oil is an effective treatment for insomnia, but this has not been formally investigated.Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the proposed trial methodology and the efficacy of Lavandula augustifolia (lavender) on insomnia.Interventions: Interventions consisted of Lavandula augustifolia (treatment) and sweet almond oil as placebo/control. The aroma was supplied via an Aromastream device (Tisserand Aromatherapy, Sussex, UK).Design: This was a pilot study with randomized, single-blind, cross-over design (baseline, two treatment periods, and a washout period, each of 1 week duration).Subjects and setting: Volunteers with defined insomnia treated on a domiciliary basis participated in the study.Outcome measures: Outcomes were assessed with the following: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) indicating insomnia (score > 5 at entry); Borkovec and Nau (B&N) Questionnaire evaluating treatment credibility; and Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (HCAMQ) assessing attitudes to CAM and health beliefs.Results: Ten (10) volunteers (5 male and 5 female) were entered and completed the 4 week study. Lavender created an improvement of –2.5 points in PSQI (p = 0.07, 95% CI – 4.95 to – 0.4). Each intervention was equally credible and belief in CAM did not predict outcome. Women and younger volunteers with a milder insomnia improved more than others. No period or carry-over effect was observed.Conclusion: The methodology for this pilot study appeared to be appropriate. Outcomes favor lavender, and a larger trial is required to draw definitive conclusions."
"AbstractObjectives: This field study investigated the potential stress-reducing effects of exposure to real or artificial nature on patients in a hospital waiting room. Additionally, it was investigated whether perceived attractiveness of the room could explain these effects.Design: In this between-patients experimental design, patients were exposed to one of the following: real plants, posters of plants, or no nature (control). These conditions were alternately applied to two waiting rooms.Location: The location of this study was two waiting rooms at the Radiology Department of a Dutch hospital.Subjects: The subjects comprised 457 patients (60% female and 40% male) who were mostly scheduled for echocardiogram, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scans, or nuclear research.Results: Patients exposed to real plants, as well as patients exposed to posters of plants, report lower levels of experienced stress compared to the control condition. Further analyses show that these small but significant effects of exposure to nature are partially mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the waiting room.Conclusions: Natural elements in hospital environments have the potential to reduce patients' feelings of stress. By increasing the attractiveness of the waiting room by adding either real plants or posters of plants, hospitals can create a pleasant atmosphere that positively influences patients' well-being."
"AbstractBackground: The purpose of this article is to describe the rationale and protocol for a pilot study in women with breast cancer that integrates the two complementary therapies of mindfulness and exercise.Design: A sample of 30 women diagnosed with breast cancer within the previous 12 months who have completed initial treatment for their disease will be recruited from oncology physicians' offices. The pilot will be a pre-post design, and the study will occur within a hospital counseling center for 2 h one day/week for 8 weeks. Participants will complete pre-and post-questionnaires on anxiety, depression, quality of life, and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist. Patients will receive audiotapes and pedometers and will keep detailed logs of their weekly homework assignments.Outcome: Appropriate statistical analyses will be carried out to arrive at data-driven results. If results show significant benefit for the participants, the program will be revised as needed for improvement.Directions: Future directions will be based on findings of the proposed pilot, which will dictate how to proceed after completion of the pilot study. A future goal, if preliminary findings and a replication study are encouraging, will be the development of a Mindfulness-based Exercise Program Manual for dissemination and use by researchers and clinicians to help empower patients with cancer."
"AbstractObjectives: To determine if meridian energy (qi or bioelectricity), as measured by the Apparatus for Measuring the Internal Organs and their Corresponding Meridians (AMI), could distinguish          between gifted and average boys and to gather evidence to assess if the AMI device could be effective as an educational diagnostic tool, specifically for identifying gifted children.Design:          Quasiexperimental design using discriminant analysis to determine how accurately the AMI could predict group membership previously determined by intelligence tests.Settings/location: Practitioner's          office within clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Subjects: Thirty-three (33 boys; gifted, n = 11 and average, n = 22) ranging in age from 9 to 12 years.Outcome measures:          Meridian nervous system energy levels as measured by the AMI.Results: On average, boys in the gifted group had statistically significantly calmer nervous system measures than the boys in the          average group. The discriminant function generated from the AMI nervous system measures accurately predicted group membership 70% of the time. Classification accuracy by groups indicated that 55% of the          gifted cases and 82% of the average cases were correctly classified. Upon cross-validation, accuracy by group stayed consistent with the average group (82%) and improved with the gifted group (64%).Conclusions:          Bioelectrical energy patterns of the nervous system, as measured by the AMI, could distinguish between gifted and average boys. The accuracy found in this current study using the AMI as a screening tool          to detect giftedness is promising, however, further studies will need to be conducted to see if the findings can be replicated.

"AbstractObjective: Unilateral nostril breathing (UNB) is a yogic pranayama technique that has been shown to improve verbal and spatial cognition in neurologically intact individuals. Early study of UNB in healthy individuals has shown benefits for attention and memory. This preliminary study explored whether UNB influenced various measures of attention, language, spatial abilities, depression, and anxiety in post-stroke individuals, both with and without aphasia.Design: A within-subjects repeated-measures design was used to determine whether UNB improved cognitive, linguistic, and affect variables in post-stroke individuals. Within-subjects comparisons determined UNB's effects over time, and between-subjects comparison was used to determine whether changes in these variables differed between post-stroke individuals with and without aphasia.Setting: Athens and Atlanta, Georgia.Participants: Eleven post-stroke individuals participated in a 10-week UNB program. Five individuals had stroke-induced left hemisphere damage with no diagnosis of aphasia (left hemisphere damage control group; LHD), and six individuals experienced left hemisphere damage with a diagnosis of aphasia (individuals with aphasia group; IWA).Measures: Individuals were assessed on measures of attention, language, spatial abilities, depression, and anxiety before, during, and after UNB treatment.Results: UNB significantly decreased levels of anxiety for individuals in both groups. Performance on language measures increased for the individuals with aphasia.Conclusions: Significant findings for language and affect measures indicate that further investigation regarding duration of UNB treatment and use of UNB treatment alongside traditional speech-language therapy in post-stroke individuals is warranted."
"AbstractObjective: The seed extracts from Nigella sativa is used by Unani physicians of traditional medicine (Hakims or Tabibs) and Ayurvedic practitioners (Vaids) in the treatment of several medical disorders including dyslipidemia, obesity, and hypertension. It is, therefore, important to prove or disprove the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of powdered N. sativa (Kalonji) seed in capsules on serum lipid levels, blood sugar, blood pressure, and body weight in adults.Design: The study design was a randomized, double-blind trial.Settings/location: Conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from February 2006 to January 2007.Subjects: Half of the respondents received powdered N. sativa (Kalonji) seed in capsule and the rest received a placebo.Intervention/outcome: Baseline and after-intervention variables recorded were the following: body–mass index, waist–hip ratio, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, serum lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase, and serum creatinine.Results: One hundred and twenty-three (123) patients were recruited. Sixty-four (64) and 59 patients were randomized to the intervention and the control arms, respectively. Thirty-nine (39) patients in the intervention group and 34 in the control group completed the study. Favorable impact of powdered N. sativa (Kalonji) seed in capsule was noted on almost all variables, but results were not statistically significant because of small sample size.Conclusions: Favorable impact of powdered N. sativa (Kalonji) seed in capsule was noted on almost all variables, but results were not statistically significant. A larger study with adequate sample size is recommended."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to determine whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone and leptin concentrations can be influenced by consumption of a probiotic supplement. A secondary focus was to investigate whether male equol excretors have a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk.Design: The design was a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial.Subjects: Thirty-one (31) of the initially enrolled 39 subjects, 18 to 37 years old, completed all study requirements.Intervention: Subjects consumed either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules for 2 months. Fasting plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin were measured on days 1 and 57. Urinary excretion of genistein, glycitein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma), and equol was measured on days 4 and 61 following a 4-day soy challenge.Results: Probiotic consumption did not significantly alter equol excretor status, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. At baseline, there were no differences in plasma hormone concentrations between equol excretors and nonexcretors; however, the low number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding.Conclusions: The 2-month intervention with probiotic capsules did not significantly alter equol excretion, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. A secondary finding was that male equol excretors in this study did not exhibit a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk, although this result should be interpreted with caution."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to test a model of placebo effects in the context of a general model of health care outcomes.Design: The design of this study was a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.Settings: The study was conducted at The University of Washington Hospital, Seattle, Washington, Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center, Camden, New Jersey, and at the Neurology Center of Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia.Subjects: One hundred and seventeen (117) patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis were enrolled in the study.Intervention: Subjects had daily exposure to a pulsing electromagnetic generator.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were the average score of three quality-of-life indices: the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale, and the Spasticity Effects Scale.Results: Placebo responders scored higher in the personality trait of Absorption compared with nonresponders (p<0.01). Placebo responders were more confident that the sham device was active compared to placebo nonresponders (p<0.009). The two factors of confidence in the treatment and Absorption accurately identified 80% of placebo responders in a discriminant analysis (p<0.0004).Conclusions: Placebo effects are best understood when integrated in a general model of health care outcomes."
"AbstractObjectives: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common problem among menstruating adolescents and young women. It may cause physical distress and result in school absenteeism and reduced physical activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure on menstrual pain and distress in adolescents with dysmenorrhea.Design: A single-blind, placebo-controlled design was used.Setting/location: Participants were obtained from one senior high school in northern Taiwan.Subjects: One hundred and thirteen (113) adolescent participants with primary dysmenorrhea were recruited and assigned to the experimental or control group by a coin toss.Intervention: The experimental group received auricular acupressure applied to six true acupoints (shenmen, Kidney, Liver, Internal Genitals, Central Rim, and Endocrine). The control group received six sham acupoints without effects on dysmenorrhea. All participants were instructed to press each acupoint for 1 minute, 4 times a day for 2 days.Outcome measures: The outcomes were assessed by rating dysmenorrhea severity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ).Results: Between-group differences were found in VAS and MDQ after the interventions. Within-group differences were found in the score changes of VAS, MDQ, and SF-MPQ during the interventions for both groups.Conclusions: Auricular acupressure relieves menstrual pain and distress in high-school adolescents. The findings may serve as a basis for using auricular acupressure to treat dysmenorrhea in adolescents. There was pain reduction with sham as well as with true acupoint acupressure, but the latter was significantly greater. The sham acupoint may not be used as a control for auricular acupoint and qualitative evaluation of dysmenorrhea should be added to the evaluation by SF-MPQ in future studies."
"AbstractObjectives: The effects of Okada Purifying Therapy (OPT), a form of subtle energy (biofield) therapy that originated in Japan, were investigated. Electroencephalograms and the Profile of Mood States scores were measured using a crossover design during OPT and placebo sessions.Participants: Nineteen (19) healthy Japanese adults (mean age±standard deviation: 40.8±11.2 years; 10 females) with no previous experience of biofield therapy participated in this study.Methods: Each session lasted 15 minutes. A single-blind, randomized design with a protocol consisting of regular cycles with eyes open followed by eyes closed was used. The power spectral value was calculated in θ (4.0–7.9 Hz), α (8.0–12.9 Hz), and β (13.0–29.9 Hz) frequency ranges.Results: The power spectral value of the α band at Fp1, Fp2, F7, Fz, F8, C3, Cz, C4, and Pz increased significantly in the OPT session compared with the placebo session. Mood state was improved after both sessions, and no significant difference was found between the two sessions.Conclusions: OPT was more effective in increasing α waves in the frontal and central cortex than a placebo treatment."
"AbstractObjective: There are fundamental differences between the administration of medications and the application of manual procedures, such as those used by chiropractors. The objective of this study was          to gather preliminary information on how to address these differences in the design of a multisite, randomized placebo-controlled trial of chiropractic care for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP).Design:          Pilot study for a multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Setting: Three chiropractic research clinics in the midwest United States.Subjects: Thirty-nine (39) women          with CPP of at least 6 months' duration, diagnosed by board-certified gynecologists.Interventions: The active intervention consisted of the chiropractic technique, lumbar spine flexion-distraction,          combined with manual Trigger Point Therapy. The placebo intervention consisted of a sham chiropractic procedure performed with an instrument combined with effleurage (light massage).Outcome measures:          The primary outcome measure was the change in the Pain Disability Index (PDI) from baseline to the end of treatment (6 weeks), assessed by group and site. If the change score was in the same direction at          all sites, the results were to be combined to estimate treatment effect size.Results: Patient characteristics were similar to those of patients with CPP in other studies. Recruitment methods,          particularly in respect to the eligibility criteria and screening protocols, would require modification in order to recruit an adequate sample for the planned randomized controlled trial. Clinicians followed          standardized procedures with apparently minimal deviation, patients in both groups were satisfied with their care and blinding appeared to be successful. PDI change scores were not consistent across sites          and so results were not combined and overall treatment effect sizes were not estimated.Conclusions: The technical and personnel resources required to achieve adequate standardization of procedures          at multiple sites may make a placebo-controlled trial unfeasible, given our current lack of knowledge about the active agent in manual chiropractic procedures.

"AbstractObjectives: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is the precancerous stage of gastric carcinoma. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used in treating CAG. This study aimed to reveal core pathogenesis of CAG by validating the TCM syndrome patterns and provide evidence for optimization of treatment strategies.Design: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in 4 hospitals in China. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and complex system entropy clustering analysis (CSECA) were performed, respectively, to achieve syndrome pattern validation.Results: Based on HCA, 15 common factors were assigned to 6 syndrome patterns: liver depression and spleen deficiency and blood stasis in the stomach collateral, internal harassment of phlegm-heat and blood stasis in the stomach collateral, phlegm-turbidity internal obstruction, spleen yang deficiency, internal harassment of phlegm-heat and spleen deficiency, and spleen qi deficiency. By CSECA, 22 common factors were assigned to 7 syndrome patterns: qi deficiency, qi stagnation, blood stasis, phlegm turbidity, heat, yang deficiency, and yin deficiency.Conclusions: Combination of qi deficiency, qi stagnation, blood stasis, phlegm turbidity, heat, yang deficiency, and yin deficiency may play a crucial role in CAG pathogenesis. In accord with this, treatment strategies by TCM herbal prescriptions should be targeted to regulating qi, activating blood, resolving turbidity, clearing heat, removing toxin, nourishing yin, and warming yang. Further explorations are needed to verify and expand the current conclusions."
"AbstractObjective: To evaluate a simulated acupuncture technique for use in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acupuncture for low-back pain.Setting: The clinic of an accredited          acupuncture college in Seattle, Washington.Subjects: Acupuncture-naïve enrollees of Group Health Cooperative who had visited their primary care provider with a complaint of back pain that          persisted for at least 3 months.Experimental design: In the first experiment, subjects received six insertions of real needles and six pokes with a toothpick in a guidetube in a two-period crossover          design. In the second experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a complete treatment with real acupuncture needles or a simulated treatment using a toothpick in a guidetube.Outcomes:          In the first experiment, we compared subjects' perceptions about which implement was used for each ""insertion"" while in the second, we compared the perceptions (e.g., acupuncturist's warmth and caring,          the reasonableness of acupuncture as a treatment) and pain relief of those who received an acupuncture treatment using needles to those receiving simulated acupuncture.Results: In the first          experiment, the toothpick insertions were perceived as slightly more like real needling than the real needling (mean ratings of 2.8 and 2.1, respectively; p = 0.08). In the second experiment, 52%          percent of those receiving the simulated needling versus 65% of those receiving real acupuncture believed they were ""definitely"" or ""probably"" receiving real acupuncture (p = 0.33). Perceptions of          acupuncture, as measured by a credibility questionnaire, were similar in the two groups. Those receiving real acupuncture were more likely to report immediate pain relief, and this was the factor most predictive          of the subject's belief about which treatment they had received (p = 0.02).Conclusions: The simulated acupuncture procedure evaluated in this study represents a reasonable control treatment          for acupuncture-naïve individuals in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acupuncture for low-back pain.

"AbstractObjective: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a major, costly public health issue that could be dramatically affected by the identification of additional conservative care treatment options. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct massage therapy protocols on strength, function, and symptoms associated with CTS.Design: This was a randomized pilot study design with double pre-tests and subjects blinded to treatment group assignment.Setting/location: The setting for this study was a wellness clinic at a teaching institution in the United States.Subjects: Twenty-seven (27) subjects with a clinical diagnosis of CTS were included in the study.Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of twice-weekly massage consisting of either a general (GM) or CTS-targeted (TM) massage treatment program.Outcome measures: Dependent variables included hand grip and key pinch dynamometers, Levine Symptom and Function evaluations, and the Grooved Pegboard test. Evaluations were conducted twice during baseline, 2 days after the 7th and 11th massages, and at a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the 12th massage treatment.Results: A main effect of time was noted on all outcome measures across the study time frame (p < 0.001); improvements persist at least 4 weeks post-treatment. Comparatively, TM resulted in greater gains in grip strength than GM (p = 0.04), with a 17.3% increase over baseline (p < 0.001), but only a 4.8% gain for the GM group (p = 0.21). Significant improvement in grip strength was observed following the 7th massage. No other comparisons between treatment groups attained statistical significance.Conclusions: Both GM and TM treatments resulted in an improvement of subjective measures associated with CTS, but improvement in grip strength was only detected with the TM protocol. Massage therapy may be a practical conservative intervention for compression neuropathies, such as CTS, although additional research is needed."
"AbstractObjective: This research examined the relationship between plasma oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), cortisol, and anxiety before, during, and after a massage in healthy adult men.Design: A randomized, controlled, crossover, repeated-measures, prospective experimental design with subjects acting as their own controls was used.Setting: The research was conducted at a Midwestern University.Subjects: Fourteen (14) healthy men between the ages of 19 and 45 years of age were randomly assigned to the order of two conditions: a 20-minute massage (experimental condition) or a 20-minute reading period (control condition).Methods: Blood samples were collected at time intervals during each data collection session. Plasma OT, AVP, and cortisol levels were evaluated by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and autonomic measures were recorded pre- and postcondition.Results: Both experimental (massage) and control (reading) conditions elicited a significant increase in plasma OT levels (p < 0.05) and a decrease in SAI score (p < 0.05) from pre- to postintervention. A significant positive correlation was detected between plasma AVP and plasma cortisol (r = 0.63, n = 24, p = 0.001) in the massage group, whereas a significant positive correlation between plasma AVP and the SAI (r = 0.47, n = 25, p = 0.016) was observed in the reading group. No significant differences were observed for the autonomic measures between conditions.Conclusions: The finding that plasma OT levels increased in both the massage and reading groups, suggests that tactile stimulus is not necessary for OT release. The results suggest that another unknown factor associated with reduction of anxiety may be involved."
"AbstractObjective: We conducted this study to gain an insight into the experiences and views of practitioners of urut Melayu, the traditional Malay massage, which will be used in developing a preliminary framework of the urut Melayu process.Design: We adopted a qualitative study design. We carried out a total of five focus group discussions (FGDs) comprising 6–10 urut Melayu practitioners each.Location: We carried out three FGDs at the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Division, Ministry of Health and two FGDs at a district Health Clinic.Subjects: All participants of the FGDs were urut Melayu practitioners registered with the Ministry of Health. Three (3) FGDs comprised all females while two comprised all males. A total of 12 males and 24 females participated in the study.Results: We identified six themes from the study, namely, indications for urut Melayu, the urut Melayu technique, other treatments in conjunction with urut Melayu, outcome of urut Melayu, ethics of urut Melayu, and practitioners' source of skills and knowledge.Conclusions:Urut Melayu is a unique form of massage carried out for various purposes. Although it is common belief that there are vast differences in the way it is performed from one practitioner to another, this study revealed that similarities do exist and there is potential to develop a standard framework for urut Melayu for regulation and training purposes."
"AbstractObjectives: Two controlled trials of aromatherapy to decrease agitation in persons with dementia have recently produced promising results. However, both studies combined the use of essential oils with massage. Thus, it is unclear if the effect of the aromatherapy intervention  was the result of smelling or the cutaneous absorption of the oils. The purpose of this study was to determine whether smelling lavender oil decreases the frequency of agitated behaviors in patients with dementia. Design: The study design was within-subjects ABCBA (A = lavender  oil, B = thyme oil, C = unscented grapeseed oil): 4 weeks of baseline measurement, 2 weeks for each of the five treatment conditions (10-week total intervention time), and 2 weeks of postintervention measurement. Oil was placed every 3 hours on an absorbent fabric sachet pinned near the collarbone  of each participant's shirt. Setting: A long-term care facility specifically for persons with dementia. Participants: Seven agitated nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Measurements: Agitation was assessed every 2 days using a modified Cohen-Mansfield  Agitation Inventory. Olfactory functioning was assessed with structured olfactory identification and discrimination tasks, and with qualitative behavioral observation during those tasks. Results: Split-middle analyses conducted separately for each patient revealed no treatment effects  specific to lavender, no treatment effects nonspecific to pleasant smelling substances, and no treatment effects dependent on order of treatment administration. There were no differences between participants with more and less intact olfactory abilities. Conclusion: There is significant  evidence in the neurologic and neuropsychologic literature that persons with dementia have impaired olfactory abilities. Concordant with this literature, this study found no support for the use of a purely olfactory form of aromatherapy to decrease agitation in severely demented patients.  Cutaneous application of the essential oil may be necessary to achieve the effects reported in previous controlled studies."
"AbstractObjectives: To use a psychosocial framework to examine the pain experiences of low-income, ethnically diverse patients before and after an Integrative Pain Management Program (IPMP).Design and methods: IPMP is a 12-week, multimodal pain group incorporating mindfulness, acupuncture, massage, education, movement, and health coaching. The authors conducted semistructured interviews at the beginning, end, and 3 months following completion of IPMP. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed and analyzed using inductive coding methods.Setting: A primary care clinic in San Francisco, CA, serving low-income, ethnically diverse patients, many of whom are marginally housed and living with disabilities.Subjects: Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of chronic pain, currently receiving prescription opioids and referred by their primary care provider, who participated in IPMP.Results: Authors thematically analyzed 104 individual interviews with 41 IPMP participants, including 41 baseline, 35 three-month follow-up, and 28 six-month follow-up. Before IPMP, participants described a psychologic “vicious cycle” of pain symptoms that worsened with movement and anxiety, while increasing their sense of disempowerment and social isolation. Following IPMP, patients reported using new strategies to manage pain, including lowering medication use, resulting in an emerging sense of psychologic resilience, and more social connections.Conclusions: IPMP offers an accessible model for addressing psychosocial aspects of chronic pain. Vulnerable patients engaged with integrative medicine groups and developed new perspectives and tools for managing their pain; they emerged feeling hopeful and resilient. These results support the use of integrative medicine groups for targeting psychosocial aspects of chronic pain within primary care."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographics, training, and practice patterns of folk medicine practitioners, their opinions toward statutory regulation of folk medicine, and the formal education and credentialing for folk medicine providers in the metropolitan Taipei area.Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used.Subjects: Included in the survey were 200 folk medicine practitioners in Taipei city and 200 folk medicine practitioners in Taipei county.Instrument: The survey questionnaire consisted of 3 domains including demographics and training; practice patterns; and opinions toward statutory regulation of folk medicine and formal education and credentialing for Tuina, Ba Guan, Gua Sha, and reflexology providers.Results: The response rates ranged from 86.3% to 99.5%. A typical folk medicine provider in the Taipei metropolitan area was a middle-aged man with a high school degree who worked about 50 hours a week. The majority of the providers in the Taipei metropolitan area received their training through apprenticeship. Years of training and experience varied widely among these practitioners. About 80% had received more than one year of training prior to starting their practice. Adult men and women were their major clientele. The major treatment modalities they offered were Tuina, Gua Sha, Ba Guan, reflexology, and meridian massage. The majority of the respondents agreed that practitioners should receive formal education and training and agreed that certifying the qualifications of folk medicine practitioners is necessary.Conclusion: Findings from the present survey provide an understanding of the training and practice patterns of Taiwanese folk medicine practitioners, highlight folk medicine practitioners' needs for formal education and training, and stress the importance of statutory regulation of folk medicine in Taiwan."
"AbstractObjectives: To provide insight into client and practitioner perceptions of the effects of shiatsu, in the short and longer term, and positive and negative in nature.Design: A two-country,          exploratory study was undertaken in the United Kingdom and Germany. In-depth interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of 14 shiatsu practitioners and 15 clients. Client interviews focused          on the experience of shiatsu and perceptions of its effects, both positive and negative. Practitioners were also asked about factors that enhanced or inhibited successful treatment. The taped and          transcribed data were analyzed using grounded theory, assisted by NVivo (QSR, Markham, Ontario, Canada) software. To enhance generalizability, the findings from the alternative country data set were presented          to a further set of practitioners in each country and as a whole to an international meeting of practitioners from seven European countries.Results: There was similarity in the perspectives          of the clients and practitioners and participants from the United Kingdom and Germany. Both described a wide range of common, immediate and longer term effects. These included effects on initial symptoms,          relaxation, sleeping, posture, and experiences of the body. A category of transitional effect arose, describing an effect that was not particularly positive and did not last long. Practitioners characterized          this as being part of the healing response. Only a few negative effects were described by clients. One mentioned a negative physical reaction and two indicated difficulties coping with emotional reactions.          While most practitioners conceived negative effects to be possible, these were more likely to be described as negative reactions.Conclusion: This exploratory study has shed greater light on          the effects of shiatsu. The sample findings provide a user and practitioner grounded base for the design of appropriate questions for exploration in a larger and more generalizable study of the effects          of shiatsu.

"AbstractObjectives: Biofield energy healing involves controversial concepts, and although numerous controlled trials have evaluated the effects, little attention has been paid to the phenomenon from the perspective of the therapists themselves.Design: Qualitative research.Settings/location: Large Midwest metropolitan area. Interviews were generally conducted in the therapists' place of business.Subjects: Experienced biofield energy therapists from several different disciplines.Interventions: Indepth semistructured interviews, tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, videotapes of demonstrations.Outcome measures: We used a grounded theory approach to uncover relevant dimensions and themes related to the process of biofield energy healing.Results: Major overall themes related to the ""nature of energy"" and the ""healer–client relationship."" Seven dimensions of the nature of energy include sources of energy, entities with energy, human energy anatomy, descriptions of energy, movement of energy, action of energy, and perception of energy. The dimensions build on one another to describe an energetic world view. The other major theme, the healer–client relationship, contains the central concept of healing facilitation as the goal of the experience. Compatibility and collaboration are critical to that process, as are creating a sense of trust and adhering to ethical standards. Communication underpins the whole process.Conclusions: The biofield energy therapists share a common energetic world view, wherein they must surrender to a universal energy while simultaneously creating a therapeutic alliance with the client who is also an active agent in healing process. This understanding has the potential to alter our assumptions about research design in biofield energy healing."
"AbstractObjectives: Qigong Yangsheng, the health-promoting method of traditional Chinese medicine that combines movement, mental exercise, and breathing technique, is used in China for the therapy of bronchial asthma, and for some time now has been enjoying an ever-widening acceptance in the Western world as well. This pilot study investigates if Qigong Yangsheng could be used as a complementary therapeutic measure to treat asthma patients in a Western industrialized country. Design: Thirty asthma patients, with varying degrees of illness severity, were taught Qigong Yangsheng under medical supervision. They were asked to exercise independently, if possible, on a daily basis and to keep a diary of their symptoms for half a year including peak-flow measurements three times daily, use of medication, frequency and length of exercise as well as five asthma-relevant symptoms (sleeping through the night, coughing, expectoration, dyspnea, and general well-being). The concept of this study was based on a single-case research design series with baseline, one teaching phase, a phase of self-practice and a refresher teaching course. A 4-week follow-up period was carried out in the same season as the original baseline phase 52 weeks later. Results: An improvement was indicated if subjects showed a decrease of at least 10 percent in peak-flow variability between the 1st and the 52nd week. This occurred more frequently in the group of the exercisers (n = 17) than in the group of nonexercisers (n = 13) (p < 0.01 chi-square with Yates correction). When comparing the study year with the year before the study, there was improvement also in reduced hospitalization rate, less sickness leave, reduced antibiotic use and fewer emergency consultations resulting in reduced treatment costs. Conclusion: Qigong Yangsheng is recommended for asthma patients with professional supervision. An improvement in airway capability and a decrease in illness severity can be achieved by regular self-conducted Qigong exercises. "
"AbstractObjective: To analyze how acupuncture therapy affects balance in patients experiencing their first stroke and to identify the stroke group with greatest improvement in balance after acupuncture intervention.Design: Retrospective case–control study.Setting: Ward of a medical university hospital.Participants: A total of 629 stroke patients were enrolled initially; 345 patients met the study criteria and 132 were analyzed (66 each in the study and control groups).Interventions: The study group received physiotherapy combined with acupuncture and the control group received only physiotherapy.Main outcome measures: The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke patients (PASS) was used to evaluate balance. This balance scale system can be subdivided into static balance (PASS-MP, maintain posture) and dynamic balance (PASS-CP, change posture).Results: This study revealed no statistically significant improvement of balance in the study group (t test). When patients with high Brunnstrom stage (Br stage) and low Br stage were analyzed separately, once again no statistical difference was detected between the study and control groups of those with high Br stage. However, among low–Br stage patients, the study group showed significant improvement in static balance (mean PASS-MP score±standard deviation: 4.7±3.7) compared with the control group (PASS-MP score: 2.8±2.7) (p<0.05).Conclusions: In first-ever stroke patients with a low Br stage, acupuncture therapy can improve static balance during rehabilitation. However, the effect on balance was limited among high–Br stage patients. This study provides information valuable to patients with hemiplegic stroke because it suggests that acupuncture can be used to improve balance. A prospective double-blind, randomized, controlled study design is recommended for future studies in patients with hemiplegic stroke."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity of survey questions about the use of herbal and other nonvitamin/nonmineral dietary supplements.Design: We conducted one-on-one, in-depth cognitive interviews with 32 respondents to test questions from the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) supplement for the 2007 National Health Interview Survey. Respondents were sampled purposively according to their use of CAM. Interviewers probed respondents for their understanding of the questions, and analysis was guided by grounded theory, an approach that generates explanations of response error that are closely tied to the empirical data.Results: We found two sources of misinterpretation of CAM questions. First, some respondents did not have any pre-established definition of what constitutes an herbal supplement while others had interpretations that did not match the intended definitions. These problems are common to many survey questions. However, a second finding is that misinterpretation also arose when respondents incorporated notions of self-concept into the act of taking “natural herbs,” and answered based on their understanding of this image rather than on actual behavior.Conclusions: There are several sources of misinterpretation of CAM questions. One of the most important sources is whether or not the respondent has created a concept of self-image that includes the use of herbal supplements. Common questionnaire design techniques such as providing definitions to respondents will not help to eliminate misinterpretation due to self-image. We found that careful question wording that does not evoke definitions of self, combined with visual aids that narrow the focus of the questions, can lead to more accurate answers."
"AbstractObjective: Many patients with cancer, women more often than men, use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and care. Our aim was to examine coping over 5 years (November 1995 to January 1999) in two samples of women with breast cancer who were treated with anthroposophic care or conventional medical treatment. The present study is part of a larger study of the outcome of anthroposophic care for women with breast cancer.Design: A nonrandomized controlled trial design was used with individual matching and repeated measurements on six occasions (at admission, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years). The matching was based on the following variables: stage of disease at entry, age, treatment during the 3 months before entering the study, and prognosis.Setting: An anthroposophic hospital and conventional hospitals in Sweden.Subjects: Sixty (60) women treated with anthroposophic medicine and 60 women from an oncology outpatient department participated. Forty-nine (49) women in anthroposophic care and 51 in the outpatient group survived 1 year; 26 women in anthroposophic care and 31 in the outpatient group survived 5 years.Intervention: An anthroposophic care program.Outcome measure: Coping was measured using the Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale. Repeat measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for within-group comparisons, and effect size (ES) was used for between-group comparisons.Results: The women in anthroposophic care showed more passive and anxious coping on admission, but this decreased over time. In the women in anthroposophic care, there were small ES improvements in fighting spirit and passive, anxious coping at 4 of the measured timepoints compared to admission.Conclusion: The choice of anthroposophic care could be seen as a possible way to cope with emotional distress in this group of women with breast cancer."
"AbstractObjective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine for treating chronic prostatitis (CPT) in China.Design: Electronic medical database from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was searched, language is Chinese; date is from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2003. A total of 108 trials were found, and all studies with words like ""randomization"" or ""quasi-randomization"" in their abstracts were included, whether they used blinding or not. Nineteen theses that met the entry criteria were downloaded and fully printed. Four groups were divided: Chinese herbs orally treated group (based on syndrome differentiation), Chinese herbs externally treated group, Chinese herbs orally and externally treated group, and integrated Western with Chinese herbs treated group.Results: All 19 articles that met the entry criteria were clinical trial studies with low quality (Jadad Score <3). The results showed that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may benefit the patients who had CPT. However, from the results of the funnel plots analysis of all four groups of clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria in this systematic review are distant asymmetrical and irregular plots, which indicate that a positive publication bias may exist. There was no obvious evidence indicating that the efficacy of the therapy in the treated groups using TCM was superior to that of the control group (Western medicine treatment group).Conclusions: All of the four groups in the clinical trials have not provided evidence of evidence-based medicine (EBM) A class (including 1a, 1b, 1c level), failed to prove that the TCM may have beneficial effects for patients with CPT, because of low quality in all the trials and a positive publication bias. Therefore, in light of some positive outcomes, a good design of multicentered, randomized, parallel-controlled and blinding trials is needed in order to make further studies, and deserve further examination for the treatment of CPT with TCM."
"AbstractBackground: Observational studies suggest that dietary isoflavones reduce breast cancer risk, and this may be caused in part by effects on endogenous hormone concentrations. Because intestinal bacteria metabolize isoflavones, it was hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would enhance the biologic effects of isoflavones, including effects on endogenous hormones.Design: Twenty (20) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors and 20 healthy postmenopausal women completed four 42-day diet periods in a randomized, crossover design. They received one of the following: isolated soy protein; isolated milk protein; soy + probiotic capsules; or milk + probiotic capsules. Each protein supplement provided 0.38 g protein/(kg body weight/day) (26.6 ± 4.5 g protein/day) and soy protein provided 0.64 mg isoflavones/(kg body weight/day) (44.4 ± 7.5 mg isoflavones/day). Probiotic capsules provided 109 colonyforming units Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain DDS™-1), Bifidobacterium longum, and 15–20 mg fructooligosaccharide.Measures: Plasma samples were collected at baseline and after each diet for analysis of estrogens, folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), androgens, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG).Results: Hormone levels were not affected by soy, probiotic supplements, or equol producer status, and neither cancer status nor equol producer status altered the effects of soy or probiotics. Furthermore probiotics did not alter the effects of soy consumption. Soy protein tended to decrease SHBG compared to milk protein diets (p = 0.05), although both proteins significantly decreased SHBG relative to baseline (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03).Conclusions: These data suggest that short-term, moderate consumption of isoflavone-containing soy protein and consumption of these particular probiotic capsules do not significantly alter reproductive hormone concentrations in breast cancer survivors or controls, regardless of equol producer status."
"AbstractObjectives: The study objectives were to evaluate outcomes in patients who have received dry needling treatments and to identify predictors of pain and disability.Design: The study was a prospective cohort follow-up design.Setting: The study was conducted at the Pain Clinic at Pingtung Christian Hospital, Taiwan.Subjects: Ninety-two (92) patients sick-listed for 3 months or longer for myofascial pain syndrome.Interventions: From February to October 2008, participants were treated at the pain clinic with dry needling of trigger points and muscle stretches of the involved muscles.Outcome measures: Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires to assess changes in pain intensity and pain interference. Data collection was performed at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Sociodemographic variables, symptom characteristics, and baseline outcome measures were analyzed using generalized estimating equation methodology.Results: The proposed dry-needling protocol reduced pain intensity and pain interference. Long duration of pain symptoms, high pain intensity, poor quality of sleep, and repetitive stress were associated with poor outcomes.Conclusions: Dry needling is an effective treatment for reducing pain and pain interference. However, long pain duration, high pain intensity, poor quality of sleep, and repetitive stress are associated with poor outcomes. Treatment outcome depends not only on the dry needling protocol, but also on disease characteristics and patient demographic profile."
"AbstractObjectives: Little research has investigated how micronutrients (minerals and vitamins) affect cognitive functioning, despite preliminary studies showing they may improve psychiatric functioning.Intervention: This pilot study investigated the impact of a 36-ingredient micronutrient formula consisting mainly of vitamins and minerals on neurocognitive functioning in 14 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and severe mood dysregulation.Design: The formula was consumed in an open-label trial over an 8-week period.Outcome measures: The participants completed tests of memory (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning) and executive functioning (Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System and Conners Continuous Performance Test) at baseline and at the end of the trial. A gender- and age-matched control group of 14 non-ADHD adults not taking the formula were assessed on the same tests 8 weeks apart in order to investigate the impact of practice on the results.Results: There were no group differences in ethnicity, socio-economic status and estimated IQ. Significant improvement was observed in the ADHD group, but not the control group, across a range of verbal abilities including verbal learning, verbal cognitive flexibility and fluency, and verbal inhibition. These neurocognitive improvements were large and consistent with improved psychiatric functioning. No changes were noted above a practice effect in visual–spatial memory and there were no improvements noted in reaction time, working memory, or rapid naming for either groups.Conclusions: Although the pilot and open-label design of the study limits the generalizability of the results, it supports a growing body of literature recognizing the importance of nutrients for mental health and cognition. The results also provide evidence supporting the need for randomized clinical trials of micronutrients as well as other experimental studies in order to better assess whether improved neurocognitive functioning may contribute to improved psychiatric symptoms."
"AbstractObjectives: CaringBridge (CB) is a web-based social network where people share information, enlist support, and access resources following a difficult diagnosis; it can also be used to disseminate supportive self-care tools, such as a gratitude practice, for its users. Gratitude practices are shown to reduce stress and fear, improve sleep, and increase positive emotions and overall well-being. The purpose of this article was to report the findings of a brief gratitude intervention delivered to CB users.Design, setting/location, subjects: This is a nonrandomized, prospective, pre- and post-evaluation study in an online community. Inclusion criteria were adults 18 years or older, English literate, willingness to participate in a mind–body practice, and active users of CB: patient, caregiver, or visitor to a site.Interventions: Participants were engaged in a daily, 21-day brief gratitude practice and were given weekly automated reminders to do their practice.Outcome measures: Outcomes included perceived stress, gratitude, social connectedness, and social assurance scales. Paired t tests were used to assess changes in outcomes; multivariate regression models were used to assess the relationship between the frequency of gratitude practice and change in outcomes.Results: Follow-up data were collected from 882/1598 participants, and nearly 70% self-reported engaging in the gratitude practice five or more days/week. Participants reported statistically significant improvement in all outcomes with small standardized effect sizes for gratitude (0.39), social connectedness (0.24), and social assurance (0.10). Changes in perceived stress (−0.73) were larger in magnitude and increased with more frequent practice.Conclusions: Among this online community, there was a high level of engagement with a brief gratitude practice, and improvements in stress, gratitude, and social support were observed. This design did not control for changes in outcomes that may be due to time trends, placebo or contextual effects, regression to the mean, or selection bias."
"AbstractBackground: Sustained and subtle hyperventilation can result in a wide variety of symptoms, leading to a chronic condition that has been termed hyperventilation syndrome (HVS). Treatment options include physiotherapy, in the form of breathing retraining (BR), but additional approaches aim to reduce the anxiety that is recognized as being a frequent component of this condition.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether acupuncture is an appropriate treatment for HVS to reduce anxiety, and whether a crossover trial is an appropriate study design to evaluate acupuncture in this condition.Design: A single-blind crossover trial was carried out comparing the effects of 4 weeks (30 minutes twice weekly) acupuncture and BR on patients with HVS. Subjects: Ten (10) patients diagnosed with HVS were recruited to the trial and randomized into two groups. Both groups received acupuncture and BR with a washout period of 1 week.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure used was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale. Other outcome measures used were the Nijmegen questionnaire and Medical Research Council Dyspnea scale.Results: The results showed statistically significant treatment differences between acupuncture and breathing retraining, in favor of acupuncture. Reductions were found in the HAD A (anxiety) (p = 0.02) and Nijmegen (symptoms) (p = 0.03) scores. There was no statistical evidence of any carryover effects. However, when graphically examining individual anxiety scores, in those who received acupuncture first, there was a reduction in anxiety levels which persisted through the washout period, suggesting that there may have been some carryover effect from this treatment.Conclusions: This study suggests that acupuncture may be beneficial in the management of HVS in terms of reducing anxiety levels and symptom severity. However, there may be some carryover effect, after acupuncture treatment, which went undetected because the small sample size. This preliminary study provides the basis for a larger, sufficiently powered and methodologically sound trial."
"AbstractObjectives: In Iranian folklore medicine, boiled extract of Stachys lavandulifolia Vahl is reputed to have therapeutic effects in painful disorders. This study evaluated the efficacy of the standardized formulation of S. lavandulifolia Vahl in reducing pain in primary dysmenorrhea, which is known to be a common disorder with significant impact on quality of life.Design: A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study.Settings/Location: Bu-Ali Hospital affiliated with Tehran Medical Branch, Islamic Azad University.Subjects: Twenty-nine patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Patients were enrolled according to medical history and gynecologic sonography.Interventions: Standardized capsules of S. lavandulifolia were prepared. All the patients were allowed to take mefenamic acid up to 250 mg/q6h if they needed, in the first menstruation cycle to estimate the analgesic consumption at baseline. By the use of an add-on design in the next cycle, they were randomly assigned to receive either herbal or placebo capsules every 4–6 h. Then, they were crossed over to the other group during the course of the trial.Outcome measures: At the end of the fourth day of each cycle, the intensity of pain was measured by visual analogue scale and McGill pain questionnaire. Statistical significance was evaluated using repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance.Results: Pain intensity was significantly decreased during consumption of Stachys lavandulifolia capsules in comparison with basic and placebo cycles (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the consumption of mefenamic acid capsules was reduced dramatically in the S. lavandulifolia cycle in comparison with basic and placebo cycles (p < 0.001).Conclusions: It was demonstrated that S. lavandulifolia-prepared formulation can reduce menstrual pain, and can probably be recommended as an add-on therapy or even an alternative remedy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with fewer side effects in primary dysmenorrhea."
"AbstractObjectives: Breathing exercises practiced in various forms of meditations such as yoga may influence autonomic functions. This may be the basis of therapeutic benefit to hypertensive patients.Design: The study design was a randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study using three groups.Subjects: The subjects comprised 60 male and female patients aged 20–60 years with stage 1 essential hypertension.Intervention: Patients were randomly and equally divided into the control and other two intervention groups, who were advised to do 3 months of slow-breathing and fast-breathing exercises, respectively. Baseline and postintervention recording of blood pressure (BP), autonomic function tests such as standing-to-lying ratio (S/L ratio), immediate heart rate response to standing (30:15 ratio), Valsalva ratio, heart rate variation with respiration (E/I ratio), hand-grip test, and cold presser response were done in all subjects.Results: Slow breathing had a stronger effect than fast breathing. BP decreased longitudinally over a 3-month period with both interventions. S/L ratio, 30:15 ratio, E/I ratio, and BP response in the hand grip and cold pressor test showed significant change only in patients practicing the slow-breathing exercise.Conclusions: Both types of breathing exercises benefit patients with hypertension. However, improvement in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity may be the mechanism that is associated in those practicing the slow-breathing exercise."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this study was to describe patients who seek treatment at an acupuncture and Oriental medicine teaching clinic in the United States, and to systematically measure and describe patients' responses after treatment using a prospective study design.Design: This is a prospective survey of clinic patients at intake and one month following the initial treatment.Settings and location: Data were collected in an acupuncture and Oriental medicine teaching clinic located in Bloomington, Minnesota.Subjects: Of 661 new patients who met eligibility criteria, 485 consented to participate.Interventions: Patients were administered two self-report questionnaires: one prior to their initial treatment, and a second sent by mail one month later.Outcome measures: Data collected at intake included demographics such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and employment, as well as main presenting complaint and chronicity. Patients were also asked at intake whether they had consulted with another health care provider, if they were under continued care, and if they had previous experience with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. Outcome measures included severity, improvement, and satisfaction. Patients were additionally asked if they continued with TCM care for their presenting condition.Results: Demographics of patients presenting to this teaching clinic were similar to those reported in other outpatient TCM settings. The majority of patients had no previous experience with TCM, and a large percentage was referred by students. Pain was the most common presenting condition, followed closely by wellness care. One month following treatment, most patients reported improvement and satisfaction with care.Conclusions: Standardized data collection and follow-up resulted in a description of patients and outcomes in an acupuncture and Oriental medicine teaching clinic, which can be used for research, educational, quality assurance, and marketing purposes."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of Curcuma domestica extracts in pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis.Study design and setting: The design and setting were a randomized controlled study at a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.Methods: One-hundred and seven (107) patients with primary knee osteoarthritis (OA) with pain score of ≥5 were randomized to receive ibuprofen 800 mg per day or C. domestica extracts 2 g per day for 6 weeks. The main outcomes were improvement in pain on level walking, pain on stairs, and functions of knee assessed by time spent during 100-m walk and going up and down a flight of stairs. The adverse events were also recorded.Results: Fifty-two (52) and 55 patients were randomized to C. domestica extracts and ibuprofen groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics of the patients in both groups were not different. The mean scores of the aforementioned outcomes at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 were significantly improved when compared with the baseline values in both groups. There was no difference in those parameters between the patients receiving ibuprofen and C. domestica extracts, except pain on stairs (p = 0.016). No significant difference of adverse events between both groups was found (33.3% versus 44.2%, p = 0.36 in C. domestica extracts and ibuprofen groups, respectively).Conclusions:C. domestica extracts seem to be similarly efficacious and safe as ibuprofen for the treatment of knee OA."
"AbstractA series of five innovative experiments conducted by Wirth et al. which examined the effect of various complementary healing interventions on the reepithelialization rate of full thickness human dermal wounds was assessed as to specific methodological and related factors. The treatment interventions utilized in the series included experimental derivatives of the Therapeutic Touch (TT), Reiki, LeShan, and Intercessory Prayer techniques. The results of the series indicated statistical significance for the initial two experiments and nonsignificance or reverse significance for the remaining three studies. This review article examines the methodological designs of the series of studies, along with the TT practitioners' phenomenologically based journal reports, to provide potential contributing correlative factors for the differential results obtained. These factors include: (1) methodological design restrictions, (2) a transference/inhibitory effect (3) the influence of experimental assistants, (4) healer visualization/ imagery techniques, (5) variations in subject populations, and (6) a potential cancellation effect. While the placebo controlled double-blind methodological designs used in the series were as stringent as those used in other fields of scientific inquiry, the overall results of the experiments were inconclusive in establishing the efficacy of the treatment interventions for accelerating the rate of reepithelialization of full thickness dermal wounds."
"AbstractObjective: The objective was to explore various methods of assessing clinically meaningful change associated with a course of acupuncture treatments.Design: The design was a prospective cohort study.Setting: The setting was an acupuncture clinic staffed by two physician acupuncturists in a university-affiliated family practice center.Subjects: Subjects consisted of consecutive new patients to an acupuncture clinic.Outcome measures: Outcomes were measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and Measure Your Own Medical Outcomes Profile (MYMOP). Outcomes measured were global clinical change and patient satisfaction.Results: Out of 112 eligible patients, 110 consented to the study and contributed baseline data. Of these, 80 (71%) completed the 2-month follow-up questionnaire. Mean age of study subjects was 54.5 (standard deviation, SD 17.6) years; 85 (77%) were female, and 75 (68%) were married. Mean number of acupuncture treatments during the 2-month follow-up period was 5.8 (SD, 3.5, range, 1 to 16). Statistically significant improvement from baseline to follow-up was observed with the bodily pain subscale of the SF-36 and with the MYMOP. Among those who completed the study, 52 (67%) felt that the main symptom for which they sought acupuncture had improved over the course of the study and 72 (90%) were satisfied with their treatment in the acupuncture clinic.Conclusions: The MYMOP instrument appears to be the most useful of the four measures used to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with a course of acupuncture treatments (SF-36, MYMOP, global clinical change, and patient satisfaction). This easy-to-administer instrument appears to be sensitive to clinical change over a 2-month period among patients who sought acupuncture for a wide variety of clinical conditions."
"AbstractObjectives: The onset of depression is often triggered by breathlessness in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is hypothesized that these are the psychologic consequences of chronic dyspnea. Lessening dyspnea might alleviate depressive symptoms. Acupressure has been shown in other studies to produce relaxation. The aim of this study was to determine if it would lessen dyspnea and reduce depression in patients with COPD.Subjects and Design: Subjects diagnosed with COPD were chosen from one medical center and three regional hospitals in Taipei, Taiwan. A randomized, block experimental design was used, with subjects and the data collector blinded. Using age, gender, pulmonary function, smoking, and steroid use as matching factors, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to either the true acupressure or the sham acupressure groups. The true acupressure group received a program of acupressure using appropriate acupoints that promote relaxation and relieve  dyspnea.  The  sham  acupressure  group  received  acupressure  using  sham  acupoints  different  from  the meridians and ganglionic sections of the true acupressure group. Both acupressure programs lasted 4 weeks, with five sessions per week that lasted 16 minutes per session.Outcome Measures: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Dyspnea Visual Analogue Scale (DVAS) were administered prior to the program as a baseline, and again following the completion of the 4-week program. Oxygen saturation and other physiological indicators were measured before and after each session.Results: The results of this study showed that the GDS scores, DVAS scores, oxygen saturation, and physiological indicators of the true acupressure group were significantly improved, compared to those of the sham acupressure group.Conclusions: These findings provide health professionals with an evidence-based intervention to use with persons with COPD. Applying this acupressure program in clinical practice, communities, and long-term care units may lessen chronic dyspnea and depression in persons with COPD."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim was to assess the effect of wool use in patients with fibromyalgia.Background: Various studies concerning the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia using nonpharmacological methods have been carried out. There are, however, no reports on the use of wool clothing and bedding in treating these patients.Design and methods: The study employed two-group, experimental design. A total of 50 patients with fibromyalgia, based on the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, were selected for the study. They were distributed equally into two groups: a control group and a treatment group. The 25 patients in each group were randomly selected and the compositions of the two groups were statistically identical. The patients in the treatment group wore woolen underwear (which covered the body from the shoulders to the thighs) and used woolen bedding such as woolen bed liner, woolen quilt and pillow during the experimental period of 6 weeks. All patients were assessed at the beginning the trial (pre-test) and the end of 6th (post-test) week. Data were collected using the visual analogue scale (0–10), tender points count, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.Results: Patients in the treatment group reported significant improvements in their conditions including a reduction in pain levels, tender point counts, and all scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (p ≤ 0.001).Conclusions: The use of woolen underwear and woolen bedding were effective in reducing the symptoms of patients suffering from fibromyalgia. The use of wool is recommended as a means of treatment for alleviating the pain of fibromyalgia.Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses provide professional support to patients with fibromyalgia. They select suitable clothes and sleeping materials for their patients with this object in mind: to keep their patients warm and to protect them from the cold."
"AbstractObjective: To investigate whether a training process that focused on consensus on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnostic criteria will improve the agreement of TCM diagnosis on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Design: The design was a prospective survey.Setting: The study was conducted at the General Clinical Research Center, University of Maryland Hospital System, Baltimore, MD.Subjects: The participants were 42 patients with RA.Practitioners: The practitioners included 3 licensed acupuncturists with a minimum of 5 years' licensure and education in Chinese herbs.Methods: A training session of TCM diagnostic procedures was conducted with an open case discussion and “real time” practice. After the training, 3 TCM practitioners examined the same 42 patients with RA separately. Patients filled out a questionnaire to serve as the data for the “Inquiry” component while physical examinations, including observations of tongue and palpation of radial pulse, were conducted by the 3 practitioners. Each practitioner provided a TCM diagnosis based upon the examination results. These diagnoses were then examined with respect to the rate of agreement among the 3 practitioners.Results: The average agreement with respect to the TCM diagnoses among the 3 pairs of TCM practitioners was 73% (64.3%–85.7%). Statistically significant differences were found between this study and the two previous studies (p < 0.001).Conclusions: After training focused on consensus on TCM diagnostic criteria, we found that these 3 same TCM practitioners who were used in phase II of the study produced a significantly higher agreement when compared to study phase I or phase II. Our study suggests that improved consensus on TCM diagnostic criteria results in increased agreement of diagnosis."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate a classroom-based Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA) program on social functioning in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Design: This was a multisite, control-to-intervention design study.Settings/location: The study was conducted in 41 classrooms in 15 schools in Brisbane, Australia.Subjects: Sixty-four (64) 5- to 12-year-old children diagnosed with ASD comprised the study group.Intervention: The AAA program consisted of 8 weeks of animal exposure in the school classroom in addition to 16 20-minute animal-interaction sessions.Outcome measures: Teacher- and parent-reported child behavior and social functioning were assessed through standardized instruments at three time points: upon study entry (Time 1), after an 8-week waiting period during the week prior to the AAA program (Time 2), and during the week following the 8-week AAA program (Time 3).Results: Significant improvements were identified in social functioning, including increases in social approach behaviors and social skills, and decreases in social withdrawal behaviors, from before to after the AAA program, but not during the waitlist period. Over half of parents also reported that participants demonstrated an increased interest in attending school during the program.Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility and potential efficacy of a new classroom-based Animal-Assisted Activities model, which may provide a relatively simple and cost-effective means of helping educators and families to improve the social functioning of children with ASD."
"AbstractObjective: To compare biologically targeted imagery (BTI) and critical thinking asthma management (CTAM) outcomes.Design: Participants were randomized to BTI (group 1, G1) or CTAM (group 2, G2) in a 2 × 2 × 4 design (BTI/CTAM × pretest/post-test × weeks [3 week averaged intervals of symptoms and peak flows]). Interventions were asthma education plus treatment (BTI or CTAM for two 2-hour sessions per week for 6 weeks). For BTI, data collection (symptoms, lung function) occurred preintervention (3 week baseline), during the intervention (6 weeks), and postintervention (6 weeks). For CTAM, data collection occurred at wait-list control (WLC) (12 weeks extended baseline), preintervention (3 weeks), during the intervention (6 weeks), and postintervention (6 weeks).Setting: Alaska Regional Hospital, Anchorage.Subjects: Seventy (70) adults (53 women, 17 men) with asthma.Interventions: WLC record keeping, BTI, or CTAM.Outcome measures: Dependent variables included asthma symptoms (wheezing, coughing, sleep, activity, attacks, peak flow) and self-report assessments of Profiles of Mood States (POMS-BI) (anxiety, hostility, depression, uncertainty, fatigue, confusion); Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-Efficacy Asthma Questionnaire (KASE-AQ); Health Attribution Test (HAT) for locus of control (LoC); and the Revised Asthma Problem Behavior Checklist (RAPBC).Results: Analyses of covariance with repeated measures contrasted BTI pre- to post-tests, time periods, and WLC; CTAM pre- to post-tests, time periods, and extended baseline WLC; and BTI to CTAM outcomes. WLC improved all POMS-BI scores except anxiety, increased internal LoC, and reduced problematic behaviors. Compared to WLC, BTI reduced wheezing, anxiety, and chance LoC, and increased asthma knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy. Compared to CTAM, BTI reduced wheezing and chance LoC, increased internal LoC, and improved 6 POMS-BI scores. Compared to extended baseline WLC, CTAM increased asthma knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, internal LoC, and peak flow.Conclusions: Both interventions significantly improved symptoms and asthma management more than record keeping. Contrary to hypothesis, BTI produced better outcomes than CTAM."
"AbstractObjectives: Cancer is an important public health concern, with millions of patients affected worldwide. Given the physical, psychological, and physiologic changes associated with cancer, holistic therapies are needed to treat all aspect of the disease.Design: A systematic review was conducted to determine the efficacy of yoga as a treatment option for cancer since 2010. Included studies were published from January 2010 to July 2012 and were indexed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Alt HealthWatch.Results: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight of these studies were performed in the United States, and one each was conducted in Slovenia, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Turkey.Conclusions: The evidence for efficacy of yoga as an alternative and complementary treatment for cancer is mixed, although generally positive. Limitations of the reviewed interventions included a mixed use of instruments, weak quantitative designs, small sample sizes, and a lack of theory-based studies."
"AbstractObjectives: To characterize the brain activation patterns evoked by manual and electroacupuncture on normal human subjects.Design: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)          to investigate the brain regions involved in electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture needle stimulation. A block design was adopted for the study. Each functional run consists of 5 minutes, starting with          1-minute baseline and two 1-minute stimulation, the interval between the two stimuli was 1 minute. Four functional runs were performed on each subject, two runs for electroacupuncture and two runs for manual          acupuncture. The order of the two modalities was randomized among subjects. During the experiment, acupuncture needle manipulation was performed at Large Intestine 4 (LI4, Hegu) on the left hand. For each          subject, before scanning started, the needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin surface to a depth of approximately 1.0 cm. Electroacupuncture stimulation was delivered using a continuous rectangular          wave form (pulse width 30 ms) at a frequency of 3 Hz. For manual acupuncture, the needle was rotated manually clockwise and counterclockwise at a rate of about 180 times per minute (3 Hz).Subjects:          Eleven right-handed, normal, healthy volunteer adults, 6 male and 5 female, ages 21-64 participated in the experiment.Results: Results showed that electroacupuncture mainly produced fMRI signal          increases in precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus/inferior parietal lobule, and putamen/insula; in contrast, manual needle manipulation produced prominent decreases of fMRI signals in posterior cingulate,          superior temporal gyrus, putamen/insula.Conclusion: These results indicate that different brain networks are involved during manual and electroacupuncture stimulation. It suggests that different          brain mechanisms may be recruited during manual and electroacupuncture.      "
"AbstractObjectives: To assess the feasibility, safety, and initial estimates of efficacy of a yoga program in postoperative care for women at high risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).Design: Single-group pretest–post-test design.Settings/Location: Patients were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center.Subjects: Twenty-one women were enrolled in the study. Women were >18 years of age, had undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer, and were at high risk for BCRL.Intervention: The women participated in an Ashtanga yoga intervention for 8 weeks. Sessions consisted of once/week instructor-led practice and once/week home practice. Particular attention was given to poses that emphasized upper body strength and flexibility, while avoiding significant time with the upper extremity (UE) in a dependent position.Outcome measures: UE volume was assessed through circumferential forearm measurement, which was converted to volume using the formula for a truncated cone. Range of motion (ROM) was assessed for the shoulders, elbows, and wrists, using a standard goniometer. UE strength was assessed for shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist flexion, and grip using a dynamometer.Results: Twenty women completed the yoga intervention, with 17 returning for final assessment. Mean age was 52 (±9.1) years and body mass index was 24.8 (±5.1) kg/m2. Postintervention, mean volume in the at-risk UE was slightly reduced (p = 0.397). ROM for shoulder flexion (p < 0.01) and external rotation (p < 0.05) significantly increased bilaterally. Shoulder abduction ROM significantly improved for the unaffected limb (p = 0.001). Following intervention, strength improved on the affected side for shoulder abduction and grip strength, and bilaterally for elbow flexion (p < 0.05 for all).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga is feasible and safe for women who are at risk for BCRL and may result in small improvements in shoulder ROM and UE strength."
"AbstractObjectives: The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of specific Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) activities (yoga, sitting and informal meditation, body scan) on immune function, circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 concentrations, and positive affect among older adults.Design: The study design comprised longitudinal analyses of data from subjects in an 8-week MBSR program.Setting: The study was conducted at a University-affiliated health center.Subjects: This study involved 100 community-dwelling older adults. Inclusion criteria were as follows: ≥65 years of age and English-speaking.Intervention: This was an 8-week MBSR program.Outcome measures: Interleukin (IL)-6 and IGF-1 levels were assayed from blood collected at postintervention assessments. Participants were immunized postintervention with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG KLH-specific antibody responses were measured prior to immunization as well as 3 weeks and 24 weeks postintervention. Participants completed a 10-item measure of positive affect at study entry and postintervention.Results: Participants maintained weekly practice logs documenting participation in yoga, sitting meditation, informal meditation, and body scan. More practice of yoga was associated with higher post-treatment IGF-1 levels and greater improvement in positive affect from study entry to postintervention. Sitting meditation was positively associated with post-treatment IGF-1. Greater use of body scanning was associated with reduced antigen-specific IgM and IgG 3 weeks postintervention but not 24 weeks. No associations were found between MBSR activities and IL-6 levels.Conclusions: Practice of MBSR activities, particularly yoga, could provide benefits for specific aspects of physiologic function and positive affect. Changes in adaptive immunity in older adult MBSR practitioners warrant further study."
"AbstractObjectives: The study objectives were to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture for reducing infertility-related stress.Design: The study design was a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture compared with a wait-list control.Setting: The study was conducted at The University of Western Sydney.Subjects: Thirty-two (32) women aged 20–45 years, with a diagnosis of infertility, or a history of unsuccessfully trying to conceive for 12 months or more, were the subjects of the study.Interventions: Women received six sessions of acupuncture over 8 weeks.Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were infertility self-efficacy, anxiety, and infertility-related stress. The women's experience of infertility and acupuncture is also reported.Results: At the end of the 8-week intervention, women in the acupuncture group reported significant changes on two domains on the Fertility Problem Inventory with less social concern (mean difference [MD] −3.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] −7.58 to 0.84, p=0.05), and less relationship concern (MD −3.66, 95% CI −6.80 to −0.052, p=0.02). There were also trends toward a reduction of infertility stress on other domains, and a trend toward improved self-efficacy (MD 11.9, 95% CI −2.20 to 26.0, p=0.09) and less anxiety (MD −2.54, 95% CI −5.95 to 0.86, p=0.08) in the acupuncture group compared with the wait-list control. Women described the experience and impact of acupuncture as positive relating to a sense of relaxation and time out, the engagement with the practitioner, and an intervention that had very few negative side-effects. Changes were also perceived after treatment with women describing a physical and psychologic sense of relaxation and calmness, and a changed perspective in relation to coping.Conclusions: Acupuncture may be a useful intervention to assist with the reduction of infertility-related stress. Further research is justified."
"AbstractBackground: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs have consistently been shown to enhance the psychosocial well-being of participants. Given the well-established association between psychosocial factors and immunologic functioning, it has been hypothesized that enhanced psychosocial well-being among MBSR participants would be associated with corresponding changes in markers of immune activity.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine changes in psychosocial and immunologic measures in a heterogeneous patient sample following participation in a MBSR program.Design: A single-group, pretest/post-test design was utilized.Setting: The intervention was conducted at an academic health center.Subjects: This pilot study involved 24 participants (aged 28–72 years). Inclusion criteria were as follows: ≥18 years of age, English-speaking, and no known autoimmune disorder.Intervention: The intervention was an 8-week MBSR program.Outcome measures: Distress and quality of life (QOL) measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form Health Survey, respectively. Immunologic measures included natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity and C-reactive protein (CRP).Results: Patients completed psychosocial assessments and provided a blood sample at baseline (pre-MBSR) and within 2 weeks post-MBSR. Significant improvements in anxiety and overall distress as well as across multiple domains of QOL were observed from baseline to post-MBSR. Reductions in anxiety and overall distress were associated with reductions in CRP. Patients who reported improvement in overall mental well-being also showed increased NK cytolytic activity from pre- to post-MBSR, whereas patients who reported no improvement in mental well-being showed no change in NK cytolytic activity.Conclusions: Positive improvement in psychologic well-being following MBSR was associated with increased NK cytolytic activity and decreased levels of CRP."
"AbstractObjective: The objective was to assess the efficacy of a yoga meditation protocol (YMP) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with drug-resistant chronic epilepsy.Design: The design was a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, add-on trial with a 12-week baseline period, followed by a 12-week supervised YMP administration phase. The frequency of complex partial seizures (CPS) was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months of the treatment period.Setting: The setting was a comprehensive epilepsy care center attached to a tertiary referral medical institution situated on the southwest coast of the Indian peninsula.Subjects: The subjects were 20 patients (14 males and 6 females, age range 15 to 47 years, median 27 years) with unequivocally established diagnoses of epilepsy with at least 4 CPS (with or without secondary generalization) during the preceding 3 months.ntervention: Intervention consisted of a YMP 20 minutes twice daily (mornings and evenings) at home, and supervised sessions of a YMP every week for 3 months. Continuation of the YMP beyond 3 months was optional.Outcome measure: The outcome measure was the seizure frequency at 3, 6, and 12 months of the treatment period. The subjects with ≥50% reduction in monthly seizure rate from baseline were classified as responders, and subjects with <50% seizure reduction as nonresponders.Results: At 3 months, a reduction in seizure frequency was noted in all except 1 patient, six of whom had ≥50% seizure reduction. Of 16 patients who continued the YMP beyond 3 months, 14 patients responded at 6 months; 6 of them were seizure-free for 3 months. All eight patients who continued the YMP beyond 6 months responded; three of them were seizure free for 6 months.Conclusions: If confirmed through randomized trials involving a larger number of patients, this YMP may become a cost-effective and adverse effect-free adjunctive treatment in patients with drug-resistant epilepsies."
"AbstractObjectives: To describe in detail the questions and deliberations leading to the development of a methodologically rigorous protocol to test the effectiveness of acupuncture on painful shoulder.Design: Randomized controlled trial using three groups, including one control group.Settings/location: A hospital in the north of Italy treating at least 8-10 painful shoulders a day, with physician/acupuncturists, physiotherapists, and assessors available to participate in the study. Subjects: Sixty patients with monolateral painful shoulder. A list of exclusion criteria is given. Interventions: Acupuncture + mobilization; mobilization alone (control); ear acupuncture + mobilization.Outcome measures: Severity of pain, scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and on the McGill Pain Questionnaire and restriction of range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder joint. Voluntary use of pain medication, Tenoxicam 20 mg, was added to the protocol.Results: The research team developed a protocol and methodology that avoids the common flaws and difficulties of previous clinical trials on acupuncture.Conclusions: Physicians and acupuncture specialists will benefit from the advice and support of a project group consisting of experienced clinicians, researchers, and statisticians when designing and preparing clinical trials on acupuncture and other complementary and alternative therapies."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different acupuncture insertion velocities.Design: This study was performed as a within-subject design to control for individual differences. The biomechanical properties of needle insertion and accompanying subjective acupuncture perception was compared between different insertion velocities.Setting: The setting for this study was the laboratory of acupuncture meridian and functional neurology, Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center, Kyung Hee University.Subjects: Sixteen (16) healthy volunteers participated in the study.Intervention: An acupuncture needle was inserted to the acupoint LI4 by an acupuncture needle insertion device (ANI-KY) at high or low speed of needle insertion.Outcome measures: Biomechanical properties such as force and depth were measured online by sensors equipped with the ANI-KY device. Participants filled out a questionnaire about acupuncture sensation or perception.Results: Acupuncture needle insertion at a higher velocity was linked with higher maximum power, lower level of pain, and de qi–like perceptions such as “compressing” and “heavy” (p < 0.05).Conclusions: These results suggest that needle insertion velocity might be a factor for controlling inadvertent pain during the acupuncture needling process and that biomechanical properties of needling may be related to acupuncture perception or sensation."
"AbstractObjective: Reports correlating total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations with arteriosclerosis have become a matter of interest amongst healthcare professionals and the public. Several commercial preparations of vitamin B complexes have been marketed as supplements intended to reduce elevated levels of tHcy. Among these preparations are those that have been specifically designed for sublingual administration. This study is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of sublingually versus orally delivered vitamin B complex in reducing serum tHcy levels.Design: Forty-one (41) subjects, between the ages of 50 and 80 years with total serum tHcy concentrations exceeding 11 µmol/L, were treated with a six-week regimen of vitamin B complex. Each B complex consisted of 1000 µg vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin), 400 µg folate (as folic acid), and 5 mg vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine HCl). Participants in the study were randomized into two groups designated, retrospectively, as SL and PO. Members of group SL were given a sublingually delivered vitamin B complex and a matching orally delivered placebo. Members of group PO were given an orally delivered vitamin complex and a matching sublingually delivered placebo. A statistically significant reduction in tHcy values was observed in both groups upon completion of the 6-week protocol.Results: There was no statistically significant difference in serum tHcy concentrations between SL and PO groups either before or after treatment, substantiating the idea that there is no difference in efficacy between the two methods of vitamin complex delivery."
"AbstractObjective: To assess existing reported human trials of Withania somnifera (WS; common name, ashwagandha) for the treatment of anxiety.Design: Systematic review of the literature, with searches conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Google Scholar by a medical librarian. Additionally, the reference lists of studies identified in these databases were searched by a research assistant, and queries were conducted in the AYUSH Research Portal. Search terms included “ashwagandha,” “Withania somnifera,” and terms related to anxiety and stress. Inclusion criteria were human randomized controlled trials with a treatment arm that included WS as a remedy for anxiety or stress. The study team members applied inclusion criteria while screening the records by abstract review.Intervention: Treatment with any regimen of WS.Outcome measures: Number and results of studies identified in the review.Results: Sixty-two abstracts were screened; five human trials met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared several dosage levels of WS extract with placebos using versions of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, with two demonstrating significant benefit of WS versus placebo, and the third demonstrating beneficial effects that approached but did not achieve significance (p=0.05). A fourth study compared naturopathic care with WS versus psychotherapy by using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores as an outcome; BAI scores decreased by 56.5% in the WS group and decreased 30.5% for psychotherapy (p<0.0001). A fifth study measured changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores in WS group versus placebo; there was a 44.0% reduction in PSS scores in the WS group and a 5.5% reduction in the placebo group (p<0.0001). All studies exhibited unclear or high risk of bias, and heterogenous design and reporting prevented the possibility of meta-analysis.Conclusions: All five studies concluded that WS intervention resulted in greater score improvements (significantly in most cases) than placebo in outcomes on anxiety or stress scales. Current evidence should be received with caution because of an assortment of study methods and cases of potential bias."
"AbstractObjectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate parental attitudes toward acupuncture for their child. No known research has explored how medical providers discuss acupuncture with families or specific concerns parents have about acupuncture. This study examined whether acupuncture attitudes were influenced by (1) the way acupuncture is explained to parents by a physician and (2) parental experience with acupuncture.Design: Parents (N = 240) read vignettes that varied in a 2 (Physician Description of Acupuncture: Traditional Chinese Medicine versus biomedical) × 2 (Gender: male versus female) design and responded to questions assessing their attitudes toward acupuncture.Results: A factor analysis of the vignette questions resulted in two factors: acupuncture acceptability (α = 0.88) and information seeking (α = 0.70). Previous experience with acupuncture significantly increased acupuncture acceptability and reduced interest in information seeking. Parents with experience were more likely to report wanting to pursue acupuncture for their child. A biomedical explanation led to increased acceptability and interest in pursuing information among parents with experience (d = 0.36), and significantly predicted parental agreement with the vignette item, “I would have my child receive acupuncture treatment.” Common acupuncture concerns included fear of needles and acupuncture ineffectiveness.Conclusions: Parents' experience with acupuncture, regardless of its perceived helpfulness, appears to play an important role in their consideration of acupuncture for their child. Additional research is needed to fully understand the importance of the way acupuncture is presented to families, as it appears to impact parental attitudes in subtle ways. Parents have numerous concerns regarding acupuncture. Our findings suggest that providers would benefit from increased awareness of families' interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine so as to better monitor safety, provide advice, and discuss treatment expectations and misconceptions."
"AbstractObjectives: Previously it was shown that a brief yoga-based lifestyle intervention was efficacious in reducing oxidative stress and risk of chronic diseases even in a short duration. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of this intervention in reducing stress and inflammation in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.Design: This study reports preliminary results from a nonrandomized prospective ongoing study with pre–post design.Setting/location: The study was conducted at the Integral Health Clinic, an outpatient facility conducting these yoga-based lifestyle intervention programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases.Subjects: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and overweight/obese subjects were included while physically challenged, and those on other interventions were excluded from the study.Intervention: A pretested intervention program included asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), stress management, group discussions, lectures, and individualized advice.Outcome measures: There was a reduction in stress (plasma cortisol and β-endorphin) and inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) at day 0 versus day 10.Results: Eighty-six (86) patients (44 female, 42 male, 40.07±13.91 years) attended this program. Overall, the mean level of cortisol decreased from baseline to day 10 (149.95±46.07, 129.07±33.30 ng/mL; p=0.001) while β-endorphins increased from baseline to day 10 (3.53±0.88, 4.06±0.79 ng/mL; p=0.024). Also, there was reduction from baseline to day 10 in mean levels of IL-6 (2.16±0.42, 1.94±0.10 pg/mL, p=0.036) and TNF-α (2.85±0.59, 1.95±0.32 pg/mL, p=0.002).Conclusions: This brief yoga-based lifestyle intervention reduced the markers of stress and inflammation as early as 10 days in patients with chronic diseases; however, complete results of this study will confirm whether this program has utility as complementary and alternative therapy."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this research is to demonstrate the possibilities of a new device and propose the method of noninvasive evaluation of the integral physiologic state of biologic objects.Design: This study was a series of experiments with an elaborated device carried out on different living systems, including plants, animals, and people.Setting: Experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Integrative Biology at Orbeli Institute of Physiology of National Academy of Science of the Republic of Armenia.Methods: The working principle of the device is based on a change of the amplitude of light reflected from the sensor when a biologic object is placed some distance from the device. The obtained signals were monitored and analyzed by computer. Comparative studies were performed by standard electrophysiologic methods.Participants: The experiments were performed mainly on laboratory rats, but some research was done with people.Results: Various biologic objects exert different influence on the device; also, signals from the photodetector are changed depending on the functional state of the studied object subjected to the physical or medical influence. The device does not respond to inanimate objects at room temperature.Conclusions: The existence of a remote influence of biologic objects on surrounding objects is discovered by means of a novel elaborated device complex. The device can be used for objective distant evaluation of a functional state of biologic objects. Particularly, it can be employed for distant registration of signals from acupuncture points and zones."
"AbstractBackground: Clinicians working in community mental health clinics are at high risk for burnout. Burnout is a problem involving emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Reiki is a holistic biofield energy therapy beneficial for reducing stress. The purpose of this study was to determine if 30 minutes of healing touch could reduce burnout in community mental health clinicians.Methods: We utilized a crossover design to explore the efficacy of Reiki versus sham Reiki, a pseudo treatment designed to mimic true Reiki, as a means to reduce symptoms of burnout. Subjects were randomized to whether they started with Reiki or sham. The Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile Version 2 (MYMOP-2) were used as outcome measures. Multilevel modeling was used to represent the relations among variables.Results: Reiki was statistically significantly better than sham Reiki in reducing burnout among community mental health clinicians (p=0.011). Reiki was significant in reducing depersonalization (p<0.001), but only among single people. Reiki reduced the primary symptom on the MYMOP also only among single people (p=0.03).Conclusions: The effects of Reiki were differentiated from sham Reiki. Reiki could be helpful in community mental health settings for the mental health of the practitioners."
"AbstractBackground: Energy medicine (EM) practitioners often claim to be able to perceive an energetic field associated with the body and to be able to use this skill to diagnose illness and guide treatment strategies. If a biofield associated with cells growing in culture is perceptible  to EM practitioners, such an in vitro model would be a useful resource for investigating biofield perception that would provide some unique advantages over clinical models. Objective: To evaluate whether EM practioners can perceive the presence of cultured human cells without  visual cues. Design: Three randomized double-blinded pilot studies were used to evaluate the ability of participants to distinguish a flask containing cancer cells growing in culture medium from a flask containing either culture medium or sterile water. Each study consisted of six  independent experiments: three with EM practitioners and three with nonpractitioners. The number of independent trials for each experiment was estimated by statistical power analyses of the design. Practitioners' feedback from the first two studies was used to revise the protocol for the subsequent  studies, with the intent to eliminate potential problems in making this distinction. Labeled flasks (""cells"" and ""no-cells"") were added to serve as references for comparison in the second study and the number of experimental trials was reduced in the third study. Subjects: Eight  experienced EM practitioners and nine nonpractitioners (laboratory personnel with no EM training). Setting: A basic science laboratory and office at an academic medical center. Outcome Measures: In the first 2 studies, we determined the number of correct determinations  in a series of 34 trials. In the third study, we determined the number of correct determinations in a series of 10 trials. Results: All participants performed at the level expected by chance. Conclusion: While preliminary and inconclusive, these pilot studies found no  evidence that EM practitioners can perceive a biofield associated with cancer cells growing in culture."
"AbstractBackground: While massage has been removed from nursing curricula, studies have reported massage as safe and effective for stress reduction, relaxation, pain relief, fatigue, and quality of life.Objective: To compare the efficacy of two intensities of touch administered during two seated massages on the attitudes of nursing students toward touch for their self-care and patient care.Participants: Nursing students who volunteered gave institutional review board–approved written informed consent to undergo massage by a licensed massage therapist.Settings/location: A private room adjacent to the nursing lab in a school of nursing.Intervention: Brief seated massages of differing intensities. Each participant received low-intensity and high-intensity touch in a two-block, randomized order, within-subjects design. Linear mixed models nested within subject and random intercept analyses were used to test hypotheses in this two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period crossover design.Outcome measures: Health questionnaires/visual analogue scales pertaining to physical/affective/and attitudinal status were completed before and after each massage.Results: Twenty-nine participants (93% female, 83% single) completed the study. Before massage, the optimal intensity of touch anticipated for self-comfort was 6.6 (0=no pressure;10=most intense pressure imaginable). The mean touch intensities were 6.7 for high-intensity massage and 0.5 for low-intensity (p<0.001). The overall percentage differences (feeling better or worse) following massage were as follows: low intensity, 37.5% better; high intensity, 62.7% better (p<0.001). Significantly more improvement was reported for energy, pain, stress, and feeling physically uptight after high-intensity compared with low-intensity (p<0.03). Participants were more likely to both receive touch for self-care and provide touch for patient care after experiencing high- versus low-intensity massage (p<0.01).Conclusions: High-intensity seated massage was more efficacious than low-intensity massage and positively influenced nursing student attitudes toward the inclusion of massage in self-care/patient care. The role of touch for self-care/patient care in the nursing curricula merits reconsideration."
"AbstractContext: Therapeutic massage has been proven to be an effective, nonpharmacologic, alternative for managing state and trait anxiety in a variety of clinical situations. However, no controlled study has investigated this effect in an addiction treatment setting.Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of chair massage for reducing anxiety in persons participating in an inpatient withdrawal management program for psychoactive drugs.Design: The design was a randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted from June 2008 to January 2009.Subjects: Eighty-two (82) adult patients received inpatient treatment for psychoactive drug withdrawal (alcohol, cocaine, and opiates).Setting: This study was conducted at the Withdrawal Management Services at the Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia.Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive chair massage (n = 40) or a relaxation control condition (n = 42). Treatments were offered for 3 consecutive days. Standard counseling and pharmacologic management were also offered concurrently to patients in all conditions.Measurements: The primary outcome measure was anxiety assessed using the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). State and trait anxiety scores were determined immediately prior to and following each treatment intervention.Results: Analysis of STAI scores showed a significant reduction in state and trait anxiety for both interventions (p < 0.001). The magnitude in the reduction in state (p = 0.001) and trait (p = 0.045) anxiety was significantly greater in the chair massage group where the effect on state anxiety was sustained, at least in part, for 24 hours.Conclusions: Within the clinical context of this study, chair massage was more effective that relaxation control in reducing anxiety. Further investigation of chair massage as a potential nonpharmacologic adjunct in the management of withdrawal related anxiety is warranted."
"AbstractThere is almost universal agreement that the quality of clinical trials of acupuncture is poor. There is an urgent need to improve their quality. The author develops here a list of 45 criteria important in the design, implementation, and writing up of controlled clinical acupuncture  trials. This list has been compiled after examining the quality assessment criteria used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews of acupuncture, general publications on clinical trial designs and methodological considerations specific to acupuncture trials. Each criterion is discussed with  recommendations about use and implementation. Additionally, each criterion is discussed relative to their importance in three types of acupuncture trial, acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, acupuncture versus standard therapy and acupuncture versus no treatment or wait-list. It is hoped that  this exploration and systematic presentation of the 45 criteria will contribute to improving the quality of clinical trials of acupuncture. Improved trial quality will lead to greater ease interpreting the results of trials, especially in systematic reviews."
"AbstractThe addictive disorders affect every aspect of a person's life, and thus the most effective interventions are those that address many or all of these issues. Although the initial evaluation and intake process for addiction assessment is lengthy, this process does give the practitioner an opportunity to provide what can be considered an optimal healing environment (OHE) in treating the addictive disorders. In addition to our traditional medical treatment modalities of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, many complementary and alternative treatment modalities address and provide additional support for the holistic approach to treatment and recovery. The important role of spirituality in obtaining and maintaining recovery and sobriety has been recognized for many years. Because one specific treatment is not effective for all people and for all of the addictive disorders, using a holistic approach and individualizing the treatment regimen is the recommended approach to disease intervention and establishing an OHE. There are instruments available for measuring the facility, the staff, and the patient in their contributions to providing an OHE for substance abuse treatment. This paper suggests study design considerations for investigating the impact of an OHE on the results of treatment and specific instruments designed for use in patients with addictive disorders."
"AbstractObjective: To determine if cranial manipulation is associated with altered sleep latency. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of cranial manipulation on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) as a potential mechanism for altered sleep latency.Design: Randomized block design with repeated measures.Setting: The Integrative Physiology and Manipulative Medicine Departments, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX.Subjects: Twenty (20) healthy volunteers (12 male, 8 female; age range, 22–35 years) participated in this investigation.Interventions: Subjects were exposed to 3 randomly ordered treatments: compression of the fourth ventricle (CV4), CV4 sham (simple touch), and control (no treatment).Outcome measures: Sleep latency was assessed during each of the treatments in 11 subjects, using the standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test protocol. Conversely, directly recorded efferent MSNA was measured during each of the treatments in the remaining 9 subjects, using standard microneurographic technique.Results: Sleep latency during the CV4 trial was decreased when compared to both the CV4 sham or control trials (p < 0.05). MSNA during the CV4-induced temporary halt of the cranial rhythmic impulse (stillpoint) was decreased when compared to prestillpoint MSNA (p < 0.01). During the CV4 sham and control trials MSNA was not different between CV4 time-matched measurements (p > 0.05). Moreover, the change in MSNA prestillpoint to stillpoint during the CV4 trial was different compared to the CV4 sham and control trials (p < 0.05). However, this change in MSNA was similar between the CV4 sham and control trials (p > 0.80).Conclusions: The current study is the first to demonstrate that cranial manipulation, specifically the CV4 technique, can alter sleep latency and directly measured MSNA in healthy humans. These findings provide important insight into the possible physiologic effects of cranial manipulation. However, the mechanisms behind these changes remain unclear."
"AbstractObjective: To explore the potential influence of curriculum, frequency of practice, and dietary quality on the health of experienced Taiji and qigong practitioners.Design: Theoretical and cross-sectional study.Methods: Responses from a volunteer sample of Taiji practitioners from across the United States were collected using an online survey. The instrument was designed to collect data on health-related quality of life, diet, and Taiji practice regimens. All experienced (≥4 years) practitioners (n = 94; mean age, 55.82 years [range, 24–83 years]) were included in the analysis. Relationships among self-reported health, diet, experience, practice frequency, and curricular complexity were analyzed.Results: Practitioners' health status did not show the typical negative association with age and was positively associated with complex curricula, practice, and high-quality diets. Significant interaction effects were seen between (1) curricular complexity and additional practice (p < 0.05) and (2) curricular complexity and diet (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Intervention designers, Taiji teachers, and practitioners should consider the potential influence of curricula, out-of-class practice, and healthy diets for optimizing health-related gains and minimizing age-related losses in interventions and community-based programs."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture on cognitive function and health-related quality of life in patients who have had a stroke.Design: This clinical trial employed a prospective, randomized, single-blind design.Settings/location: The study was conducted at the department of rehabilitation medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.Subjects: Thirty-eight (38) participants were recruited, but only 33 completed the study. Seventeen (17) stroke participants with cognitive impairment were assigned to the treatment group and 16 were assigned to the control group.Interventions: Electroacupuncture was applied to acupuncture points PC6 and HT7 for 20 minutes twice a week for 8 weeks in the treatment group, while participants in each group continued rehabilitation.Outcome measures: Cognitive assessment (LOTCA-G) and quality-of-life assessment (SF-36 and SS-QOL) were carried out in each group at baseline and at 8 weeks after treatment.Results: Significant improvement was detected in four subtests of LOTCA-G: orientation, perception, praxis, and attention (p < 0.05) between treatment and control groups. Significant improvement was also indicated in subscales of SF-36 (RP, VT, SF, RE, MH, MCS) and SS-QOL (language) (p < 0.05). No correlation was noted between the variables of LOTCA-G and SF-36/SS-QOL except four matches: Memory (LOTCA-G) and Mental Component Summary (SF-36): r = 0.492; Memory (LOTCA-G) and Personality (SS-QOL): r = 0.485; Praxis (LOTCA-G) and Language (SS-QOL): r = 0.616; Orientation (LOTCA-G), and Language (SS-QOL): r = 0.534.Conclusions: The results of this study confirm a positive effect of electroacupuncture on cognition and quality of life in patients who had a stroke. Future research will be required to evaluate potential mechanisms and potential long-term benefits."
"AbstractObjective: The southern U.S. region has among the highest incidence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Historically, African Americans in this region have been a difficult to reach population for clinical research participation. This study's aim was to observe any association between herbal tea consumption and CRS symptoms among African Americans. We recount the volunteers self-reporting of measurements associated with self-treatment of CRS symptoms.Design: The study design was a preliminary, open-label, pilot study.Settings: Volunteers were drawn from Morehouse School of Medicine's outpatient clinics, community multipurpose senior centers, and churches in Fulton and DeKalb Counties, GA.Subjects: One hundred (100) African American volunteers were prescreened, of whom 55 with a clinical diagnosis of CRS met entrance criteria.Intervention: Volunteers self-administered Breathe Easy® herbal tea for a duration of 6 weeks.Outcome measures: The Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS) scale was administered to assess sinus health at baseline and term and overall quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) index.Results: Of the 55 volunteers who met entrance criteria, 41 completed the study; groups were q.i.d. (n = 27), t.i.d. (n = 4), b.i.d. (n = 5), and noncompliant (n = 5). For the q.i.d. group (n = 27), there was a significant increase in the CSS symptom score (difference in means 22.0 points; p = 0.020) and CSS total score (11.1 points; p = 0.020). Overall health status (SF-36) reported at baseline was 35% very good; 34% good; and 17% fair. After 6-weeks, the q.i.d. group showed a significant change to 44% good and 45% very good (p = 0.001).Conclusions: This preliminary pilot study suggests that q.i.d. self-administration of Breathe Easy was associated with improved volunteers' sinus health status (e.g., ability to fall sleep). Our results suggest that this herbal tea may contribute as a complementary therapy for management of CRS among African Americans. To further assess efficacy and applicability to other populations, randomized controlled trials in larger populations are warranted."
"AbstractObjective: This paper reports on the design and testing of a new questionnaire, “Perspectives on the Use in Communities of CAM” (the PUC-CAM-Q [questionnaire]).Design: The questionnaire consisted of scales and questions for 27 concepts considered to affect complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage. Scales encompassed 13 beliefs about nature, scientific medicine, and the environment, as well as personal characteristics, such as stoicism and resilience. A matrix provided space for respondents to indicate their use, or likelihood of use, of 23 of the most commonly available CAM modalities. Also included were questions about the reasons for CAM use and sources of health information.Location: The questionnaire was mailed to a randomly selected sample of people in a pilot study of two metropolitan and five rural localities in Victoria, Australia.Results: The response rate was 40% (n = 459). The majority of the questionnaires were completed consistently, and the reliability and validity and questions were satisfactory. Seven (7) of the 13 scales that explored the beliefs and concerns about CAM use and the characteristics of the respondents had Cronbach alphas of above 0.7. Refinement of the other six scales resulted in alphas of between 0.6 and 0.7, with good corrected item-total correlations for included questions. Responses to the matrix question on the use, or likelihood of use, of individual CAM modalities were also good. However, some adjustments to the layout would provide more comprehensive information for future use of the PUC-CAM-Q.Conclusions: This questionnaire provided good data that were appropriate for the exploratory nature of this PUC-CAM study. After more attention to the scales, as well as some refinement of some nonscale questions, the PUC-CAM-Q would be a practical instrument for further studies on CAM use."
"AbstractIntroduction: Acupuncture has been shown to alleviate symptoms and increase general well-being in different medical patient samples. A major challenge in acupuncture clinical research is the availability of comparable and standardized patient-reported outcome measurement (PRO) tools.Objectives: This study used a pragmatic design to examine longitudinal changes in quality of life (QOL) in a medical patient sample following acupuncture using PROs from the National Institutes of Health's Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative. It also examined the role of acupuncture expectancies, as well as patient and provider perceptions of acupuncture benefit.Design: Following informed consent, patients completed baseline QOL measures (T1) prior to their first acupuncture session. Subsequent assessments (up to 20) were completed immediately following ensuing acupuncture sessions. Patients completed assessments either on a touch-screen computer at the clinic or from their home computer.Results: Compared with acupuncture-naïve participants, those who received prior acupuncture treatment reported significantly higher anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lower positive affect at baseline. By the second assessment, however, these differences became nonexistent. Participants who held greater baseline acupuncture expectations (e.g., their situation would improve a lot, they would have improved coping skills, their symptoms would disappear, their energy would increase) reported significantly higher fatigue, pain interference, and problems with physical functioning. Between T1 and T2, all participants reported significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Exploratory longitudinal models demonstrated significant linear improvements over time in anxiety (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.007), pain interference (p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (p = 0.004). No linear reduction over time was found with fatigue (p = 0.587), physical function (p = 0.654), or positive affect (p = 0.247).Conclusions: Overall, PROMIS computer adaptive tests were able to assess domains of QOL briefly. Although pretreatment acupuncture expectations highlighted subgroup differences in outcomes at baseline, linear-growth models demonstrated the positive effects of acupuncture over time on anxiety, depression, pain interference, and sleep disturbance."
"AbstractObjectives: Women across the globe seek acupuncture to treat pregnancy concerns. Randomized controlled trials have indicated limited benefits of acupuncture in pregnancy, but field studies involving practitioners are needed to better understand the outcomes of usual care. To advance research on pregnancy acupuncture, this study engaged field-based practitioners to discuss research strategies.Settings/Location: U.S. Pacific Northwest region.Design and participants: Live focus group with regional specialized acupuncturists. Content analysis involved research team and interviewees.Results: Practitioners generally focused on patient care, although they discussed valuing research for communicating with patients and biomedical practitioners. To increase research in this area, practitioners proposed partnering with professional organizations, using social media, assuring confidentiality, and designing brief measurement tools.Conclusions: Practitioners valued evidence for specific uses and proposed several novel research strategies. On the basis of these results, a framework is proposed for building a patient-centered collaboration between research and practice communities that is responsive to paradigmatic preferences and the overarching goals of science."
"AbstractObjective: This study was carried out to evaluate the potential effectiveness of herbal treatments used for herpes zoster (HZ) by a great number of people living with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (PLWAs) in Uganda.Setting: Kampala, Uganda. Clinics of indigenous traditional healers, at the Department of Medicine of Mulago Hospital, Makerere University, and at The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) Clinic, providing primary care to people living with HIV and AIDS.Design, patients, and participants: Nonrandomized, nonplacebo controlled, observational study in two phases. Inclusion criteria included HIV seropositivity and a recent HZ attack. In phase 1, 52 patients were enrolled, treated, and followed for up to 3 months at three healers' clinics, and compared to 52 TASO Clinic controls receiving ambulatory care. Phase 2 was similar in design to phase 1, but lasted longer (6-month follow-up) and involved 154 hospital outpatients treated with herbal medicine and 55 TASO controls. In both phases, healer patients were given herbal treatment according to healers' prescriptions, while controls received either symptomatic treatment or acyclovir.Results: Healer patients and controls experienced similar rates of resolution of their HZ attacks. Fewer healer patients than controls experienced superinfection in phase 1 (18% versus 42%, p < 0.02) and fewer healer patients showed keloid formation in either phase. This difference was not statistically significant.In both phases, zoster-associated pain resolved substantially faster among healer patients with a higher degree of significance in phase 2 where the progression of pain over time could be seen because of the longer follow-up (phase 1: maximum p value (pmax) < pmax < 0.02 at 1 month, pmax < 0.005 at 2 months, pmax < 0.0001 at 3 months).Conclusion: Herbal treatment is an important local and affordable primary care alternative for the management of HZ in HIV-infected patients in Uganda and similar settings."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of the current study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a culturally- and stage-of-disease-appropriate measure of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among a population of African-American individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) using a mixed-method design.Design: Data were collected in two phases. In phase 1, qualitative data were used to refine an existing CAM measure for the specific study population in the present study. In phase 2, this refined instrument was implemented in a larger sample. The resulting numeric data were analyzed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the revised CAM instrument.Setting: Data were collected from patients who were receiving care from the infectious disease clinic of a large, public, urban hospital in the Southeastern United States.Subjects: Patients were eligible to participate if they (1) were receiving their care from the clinic, (2) had an AIDS diagnosis, (3) were identified as African-American, (4) were ≥21 years of age, (5) spoke English, and (6) were not cognitively impaired.Measures: Focus groups in phase 1 were conducted with a semistructured focus group guide. Participants also completed a basic sociodemographic survey. Phase 2 participants used programmed laptops to answer questions about their CAM use and several sociodemographic questions.Results: Information from the focus groups prompted some substantive revisions in the already-existing CAM survey. The revised instrument had satisfactory face validity and adequate test–retest reliability (r = 0.79). Furthermore, the instrument factored in a manner that was interpretable and consistent with prior findings.Conclusions: In order for human immunodeficiency virus health care providers to provide the best care to their patients, they need to be informed about the types and frequency of CAM use among their patients. This can be accomplished by methodologically developing CAM instruments, rigorously implementing and assessing these instruments, and then disseminating the findings to researchers and practitioners."
"AbstractObjectives: This study gathers preliminary data about the biologic effects of repeated Swedish massage therapy compared to a light-touch control condition.Design: The study design was a 5-week comparison of repeated Swedish massage and light touch on oxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocyte markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine function.Setting: The setting was an outpatient research unit in an academic medical center.Participants: The study subjects were medically and psychiatrically healthy young adults.Intervention: The study comprised 45 minutes of Swedish massage or light touch, using highly specified and identical protocols, either weekly or twice weekly for 5 weeks.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were mean differences between massage and light touch on OT, AVP, ACTH, CORT, lymphocyte markers, and cytokine levels.Results: Compared to the touch control condition, weekly Swedish massage stimulated a sustained pattern of increased circulating phenotypic lymphocyte markers and decreased mitogen-stimulated cytokine production, similar to what was previously reported for a single massage session, while having minimal effect on hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal function. Twice-weekly massage produced a different response pattern with increased OT levels, decreased AVP, and decreased CORT but little effect on circulating lymphocyte phenotypic markers and a slight increase in mitogen-stimulated interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-2 levels, suggesting increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Conclusions: There are sustained cumulative biologic actions for the massage and touch interventions that persist for several days or a week, and these differ profoundly depending on the dosage (frequency) of sessions. Confirmatory studies in larger samples are needed."
"AbstractBackground: Patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF) frequently feel physical suffering and anxiety.Objectives: The researchers investigated whether back massage could reduce anxiety, discomfort, and physical suffering in patients with CHF. The effects of gender and severity-dependent response of back massage on anxiety and discomfort in patients were also analyzed.Design: The study used a quasi-experimental design with one group pretest and posttest.Participants: Sixty-four participants were recruited in southern Taiwan.Outcome measures: The modified State Anxiety Inventory, the discomfort Visual Analogue Scale, electronic blood pressure (BP) gauges, stethoscopes and the pulse oximetry were used in this study.Results: The participants' systolic BP (F (3, 189)=18.91, p<0.01), diastolic BP (F (3, 189)=13.40, p<0.01), heart rate (F (3, 189)=26.28, p<0.01), and respiratory rates (F (3, 189)=5.77, p<0.01) were significantly decreased after back massage. Oxygen saturation levels showed significant increases (F (3, 189)=42.82, p<0.01). Male participants revealed a more significant reduction in anxiety than the female participants (F (1, 50)=7.27, p=0.01). Those with more severe heart failure and greater levels of anxiety (F (2, 61)=4.31, p=0.02) and systolic BP (F (2, 61)=3.86, p=0.03) demonstrated significantly greater responses to back massage.Conclusions: Back massage significantly reduced anxiety in the study population. Systolic BP decreased to a greater degree in the male participants, particularly in those with severe heart failure and greater levels of anxiety and higher systolic BP. This study was conducted without a control group. Randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the effectiveness of back massage on patients with CHF."
"AbstractObjectives: The main purpose of this study was to measure the effect of a single session of Reiki on physical and psychological health in a large nonclinical sample.Design: The study design was a single arm effectiveness trial with measures at pre-and postintervention.Settings: The study took place at private Reiki practices across the United States.Subjects: Reiki practitioners were recruited from an online mailing list to participate in the study with their Reiki clients. A total of 99 Reiki practitioners met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. Reiki practitioners were instructed to give a flyer to each of their Reiki clients that contained information about the study and invited the client to complete a survey before and after their Reiki session.Interventions: Trained and certified Reiki Masters conducted the Reiki sessions in person, with each session lasting between 45 and 90 min.Outcome measures: The well-validated 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was used to assess affect, and brief, single-item self-report measures were used to assess a wide range of physical and psychological variables immediately before (pre) and after (post) the Reiki session.Results: A total of N = 1411 Reiki sessions were conducted and included in the analysis. Statistically significant improvements were observed for all outcome measures, including positive affect, negative affect, pain, drowsiness, tiredness, nausea, appetite, shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, and overall well-being (all p-values <0.001).Conclusions: The results from this large-scale multisite effectiveness trial suggest that a single session of Reiki improves multiple variables related to physical and psychological health."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among cancer impact, belief in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), CAM use, and quality of life (QOL).Design: The study used a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design with convenience sampling. A total of 122 cancer patients participated. Data were collected at a medical center in Chunghua, Taiwan. The questionnaires included the Chinese version of the Cancer Problem in Living Scale (CPILS), Complementary and Alternative Medicine Belief Inventory (CAMBI), Complementary and Alternative Medicine scale, and Chinese versions of QOL scales, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G).Results: The mean age was 56.5 years, and most participants were male (n = 69, 56.6%), had completed high school or above (n = 56, 45.9%), and were married (n = 109, 89.3%). The most common type of cancer was oral (n = 17, 13.9%), followed by esophageal (n = 15, 12.3%) and colorectal (n = 13, 10.7%). Cancer patients, on average, use one or two types of CAM. The impact of cancer is significantly related to age (F = 7.12, p < 0.05), and income is related to QOL (F = 3.61, p < 0.05). Pearson correlations showed that the use of CAM was positively associated with belief in CAM (CAMBI) (r = 0.26, p = 0.01), and the impact of cancer was highly negatively associated with QOL (r = −0.71, p = 0.001). The predictors of QOL were the impact of cancer and use of CAM, and the impact of cancer accounted for 51% of the variance in QOL.Conclusion: This study supports research on the impact of cancer, belief in CAM, and use of CAM as related to QOL in cancer patients. These results can be used to provide options to clinicians and cancer patients."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to evaluate resistance training (RES) and RES combined with chiropractic treatment (RES-C) on fibromyalgia (FM) impact and functionality in women with FM.Design: The design of the study was a randomized control trial.Setting: Testing and training were completed at the university and chiropractic treatment was completed at chiropractic clinics.Participants: Participants (48 ± 9 years; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to RES (n = 10) or RES-C (n = 11).Intervention: Both groups completed 16 weeks of RES consisting of 10 exercises performed two times per week. RES-C received RES plus chiropractic treatment two times per week.Outcome measures: Strength was assessed using one repetition maximum for the chest press and leg extension. FM impact was measured using the FM impact questionnaire, myalgic score, and the number of active tender points. Functionality was assessed using the 10-item Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance test. Analyses of variance with repeated measures compared groups before and after the intervention.Results: Six (6) participants discontinued the study: 5 from RES and 1 from RES-C. Adherence to training was significantly higher in RES-C (92.0 ± 7.5%) than in RES (82.8 ± 7.5%). Both groups increased (p ≤ 0.05) upper and lower body strength. There were similar improvements in FM impact in both groups. There were no group interactions for the functionality measures. Both groups improved in the strength domains; however, only RES-C significantly improved in the pre- to postfunctional domains of flexibility, balance and coordination, and endurance.Conclusions: In women with FM, resistance training improves strength, FM impact, and strength domains of functionality. The addition of chiropractic treatment improved adherence and dropout rates to the resistance training and facilitated greater improvements in the domains of functionality."
"AbstractObjectives: To quantify different aspects of the quality of reporting of herbal medicine clinical trials, to determine how that quality is affecting the conclusions of meta-analyses, and to target areas for improvement in future herbal medicine research reporting.Study design: The Electronic databases PubMed, Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, and Alt HealthWatch were searched for meta-analyses of herbal medicines in refereed journals and Cochrane Reviews in the years 2000–2004 and 2010–2014. The search was limited to meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials involving humans and published in English. Judgments and descriptions within the meta-analyses were used to report on risks of bias in the included clinical trials and the meta-analyses themselves.Results: Out of 3264 citations, 9 journal-published meta-analyses were selected from 2000 to 2004, 116 from 2010 to 2014, and 44 Cochrane Reviews from 2010 to 2014. Across both time frames and categories of publication, <42% of the trials included in the meta-analyses described adequate randomization; <19% described concealment methods; <26% described double blinding; <29% described outcome assessment blinding, ≤53% discussed incomplete data, and <36% were nonselective in their reporting. Less than 54% of trials reported on adverse events and 64% of meta-analyses did not include a single trial with a low risk of bias. Taxonomic verification and chemical characterization of test products were infrequent in trials. Only 40% of meta-analyses considered publication bias and, of those that did, 90% found evidence for it. Cochrane Reviews were more likely than other sources to make negative conclusions of efficacy or to defer conclusions because of the absence of high quality trials.Conclusions: Meta-analyses of herbal medicines include a significant number of clinical trials that do not meet the recommended standards for clinical trial reporting. This quantitative assessment identified significant publication bias and other bias risks that may be due to inadequate trial design or incomplete reporting of outcomes. Suggested improvements to herbal medicine clinical trial reporting are discussed."
"AbstractObjective: Fibromyalgia is a common, chronic pain condition for which patients frequently use complementary and alternative medicine, including Reiki. Our objective was to determine whether Reiki is beneficial as an adjunctive fibromyalgia treatment.Design: This was a factorial designed, randomized, sham-controlled trial in which participants, data collection staff, and data analysts were blinded to treatment group.Setting/location: The study setting was private medical offices in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area.Subjects: The subjects were comprised 100 adults with fibromyalgia.Intervention: Four (4) groups received twice-weekly treatment for 8 weeks by either a Reiki master or actor randomized to use direct touch or no touch (distant therapy).Outcome measures: The primary outcome was subjective pain as measured by visual analog scale at weeks 4, 8, and 20 (3 months following end of treatment). Secondary outcomes were physical and mental functioning, medication use, and health provider visits. Participant blinding and adverse effects were ascertained by selfreport. Improvement between groups was examined in an intention-to-treat analysis.Results: Neither Reiki nor touch had any effect on pain or any of the secondary outcomes. All outcome measures were nearly identical among the 4 treatment groups during the course of the trial.Conclusion: Neither Reiki nor touch improved the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Energy medicine modalities such as Reiki should be rigorously studied before being recommended to patients with chronic pain symptoms."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of the study was to study the short-term impact of a brief lifestyle intervention based on yoga on some of the biochemical indicators of risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.Design: The variables of interest were measured at the beginning (day 1) and end (day 10) of the intervention using a pre–post design.Setting: The study is the result of operational research carried out in our Integral Health Clinic (IHC). The IHC is an outpatient facility which conducts 8-day lifestyle modification programs based on yoga for prevention and management of chronic disease. A new course begins every alternate week of the year.Subjects: The study is based on data collected on 98 subjects (67 male, 31 female), ages 20–74 years, who attended one of our programs. The subjects were a heterogeneous group of patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and a variety of other illnesses.Intervention: The intervention consisted of asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, lectures and films on the philosophy of yoga and the place of yoga in daily life, meitation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were fasting plasma glucose and serum lipoprotein profile. These variables were determined in fasting blood samples, taken on the first and last day of the course.Results: Fasting plasma glucose, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very- LDL cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and total triglycerides were significantly lower, and HDL cholesterol significantly higher, on the last day of the course compared to the first day of the course. The changes were more marked in subjects with hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia.Conclusions: The observations suggest that a short lifestyle modification and stress management education program leads to favorable metabolic effects within a period of 9 days."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to evaluate a program for managing myofascial pain syndrome (MPS).Design: The study design was a randomized controlled trial.Setting: The setting was the pain clinic of an academic hospital in Taiwan.Participants: Sixty-two (62) patients with a 3-month or longer history of MPS who were treated at this institution from July to November 2007 were included in the study.Interventions: The participants were randomized to an experimental group (n = 32) or a control group (n = 30). Both groups underwent trigger-point dry needling and muscle-stretch exercise regimen for passively stretching the affected muscles to their normal lengths; the experimental group then watched an 8-minute multimedia instructional video about MPS with supplemental handouts.Main outcome measures: The Brief Pain Inventory–Taiwan was administered at baseline and 1 month thereafter. The effect size model was used to measure the effects of Brief Pain Inventory–Taiwan. Bootstrap estimation was used to derive 95% confidence intervals for group differences.Results: Compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly less interference of pain, lower intensity of present pain, and least pain (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis of patients with shoulder pain revealed significantly improved pain intensity and interference of pain (p < 0.05).Conclusions: The findings emphasize the importance of including patient education programs in MPS intervention."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the psychophysiological          systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical papers (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally          arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a third paper (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information          involved in intuitive perception.Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two          experimental conditions: a baseline condition of normal psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG),          from which cortical event-related potentials and heartbeat-evoked potentials were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/accelerations were derived. These measures were          used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed.Results: The study's results are presented in two parts. The main findings in relation to the heart's          role in intuitive perception presented here are: (1) surprisingly, the heart appears to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) a significantly greater heart rate deceleration occurred prior to          future emotional stimuli compared to calm stimuli; (3) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Part 2 will present results indicating where in the brain intuitive          information is processed and data showing that prestimulus information from the heart is communicated to the brain. It also presents evidence that females are more attuned to intuitive information from          the heart.Conclusions: Overall, we have independently replicated and extended previous research documenting prestimulus responses. It appears that the heart is involved in the processing and          decoding of intuitive information. Once the prestimulus information is received in the psychophysiologic systems, it appears to be processed in the same way as conventional sensory input. This study presents          compelling evidence that the body's perceptual apparatus is continuously scanning the future. To account for the results presented in Parts 1 and 2, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles          explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about future events is spectrally enfolded.

"AbstractObjectives: The timely recruitment of study participants is a critical component of successful trials. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common nonmalignant urologic condition among older men, is characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Successful recruitment methods for a trial of medical therapy for BPH, Medical Therapy of Prostate Symptoms (MTOPS), were mass mailing and advertising. The Complementary and Alternative Medicines Trial for Urological Symptoms (CAMUS) was designed to evaluate a botanical therapy, saw palmetto, for the treatment of BPH. The objective of this study was to evaluate recruitment strategies for CAMUS and to contrast the baseline characteristics of CAMUS participants with those recruited to a similar trial using conventional medical therapy.Design: CAMUS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of saw palmetto given at escalating doses over an 18-month period on relief from LUTS.Subjects: The target enrollment goal was 350 men with LUTS from 11 clinical centers over a 12-month period. The recruitment techniques used and participants contacted, screened, and randomized through each technique were obtained from the clinical centers. Baseline characteristics of the CAMUS participants were compared with participants in the MTOPS trial who met the CAMUS eligibility criteria for LUTS.Results: The target enrollment goal was achieved in 11 months. The overall monthly recruitment rate per site was 3.7 and ranged from 2.4 to 8.0. The most successful recruitment methods were mass mailing and advertising, which accounted for 39% and 35% of the study participants, respectively. In comparison to MTOPS participants, CAMUS participants were younger, more highly educated, more diverse, and had less severe urinary symptoms.Conclusions: Successful recruitment methods for CAMUS were similar to those in MTOPS. The use of botanical therapy attracted a less symptomatic and more educated study population."
"AbstractObjective: To evaluate the effect of micronutrients (minerals and vitamins) on adult psychosis when added to conventional medications by using a placebo-controlled randomized design with a 1-month open-label run-in.Design: Longitudinal comparison study following a randomized, controlled trial that had failed because participants declined to undergo randomization.Setting/Locations: Rural primary care and psychiatry clinic in northern New England (town of 16,000 people).Participants: People older than age 18 years diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who were receiving medications.Intervention: Fifty consecutive clients seen in 1 month's time were invited to participate; 19 completed a 1-month open-label phase of the addition of a micronutrient to their medication regimen; all 19 then withdrew rather than risk randomization to a placebo. This finding itself was important, so the study was restructured to compare the response of those 19 patients during 24 months of micronutrients + medication to the response of the 31 people who declined participation, enriched by an additional 28 consecutive patients recruited over the second month of the study. This yielded a total of 59 patients who received medication without micronutrients.Outcome measures: All clients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Global Impression scale at study baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months. Psychosis was confirmed with clinical interview by using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision, criteria. All participants had normal physical examinations and laboratory studies.Results: Outcomes were similar for both groups until 15 months, although the micronutrient group used significantly less antipsychotic medication throughout that time (p < 0.001). At 15 months, the micronutrients + medication group exhibited significantly fewer symptoms than the medication-only group, a difference that was even stronger at 24 months.Conclusions: Micronutrients may appear to be a beneficial long-term, adjunctive strategy for people with psychotic disorders, allowing for smaller doses of medication to achieve the same effectiveness with fewer side effects."
"AbstractObjectives: Despite the recognized importance of phagocytes in the maintenance and recovery of health, the influence of meditation on their functions is not properly established. This investigation aimed at evaluating the influence of pranic meditation on the functions of phagocytes, and on the levels of hormones that influence them.Design: A pre–post design was adopted.Setting: The investigation was carried out at a university research laboratory.Subjects and methods: Twenty-nine (29) healthy individuals of both sexes, 24–67 years old (median 45), with no previous experience in meditation, received 3-hour-duration weekly training on pranic meditation during 10 weeks and agreed to engage in daily home practice for 20 minutes. Pranic meditation is a novel method of meditation, based on the Vedic tradition, which uses techniques of breathing and visualization for quieting the mind, and for capturing and intentionally directing prana (“vital energy”) wherever necessary. For assessing phagocytosis, the production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide by monocytes, and the concentrations of corticotrophin and cortisol, blood was collected at the beginning (week 1), at the middle (week 5), and by the end (week 10) of the practice period. At the same intervals, melatonin concentrations were evaluated in the saliva.Results: Those who meditated for more than 980 minutes showed increased phagocytosis, their monocytes produced higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, and their plasma levels of corticotrophin were reduced. The production of nitric oxide by monocytes, and the levels of cortisol and melatonin were not modified by meditation.Conclusions: This is the first study to show that a short program of pranic meditation practice was able to upregulate the function and metabolism of phagocytes, in parallel with the reduction of the plasma levels of corticotrophin. The results of this study point to a possible causal effect between these events, and indicate that pranic meditation could be useful for stimulating the function and metabolism of phagocytes."
"AbstractBackground and Objective: Spastic hypertonia usually occurs in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Spinal motor neuron excitability has been reported to increase in patients with brain damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of acupuncture on spinal motor neuron excitability in patients with DOC following TBI by using evoked electromyography.Setting and Participants: Eleven male patients (mean age, 33 ± 14 years) with refractory muscle spasticity of the upper extremity accompanying chronic DOC following TBI and admitted to Chubu Medical Center for Prolonged Traumatic Brain Dysfunction were included.Design: A crossover study design was used. Changes in variables in the acupuncture session were compared with those in the control session in the same patients.Intervention: Acupuncture treatment was performed at GV 26, Ex-HN 3, bilateral LI 4, and ST 36 for 10 minutes.Outcome measures: F-wave was recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The main outcome measure was F/M amplitude ratio (F-wave amplitude/M-wave amplitude), calculated as an index for spinal motor neuron excitability. F-waves were recorded before treatment (baseline), 10 minutes after needle insertion (phase 1), and 10 minutes after needle removal (phase 2). The same procedure was followed in the control session without acupuncture on a separate day.Results: F/M ratio was significantly reduced from baseline to phase 1 (p < 0.001) and phase 2 (p < 0.001) in the acupuncture session, whereas no significant changes were observed in the control session. Changes in F/M ratio from baseline to phase 1 and phase 2 were greater in the acupuncture session than the control session (p = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively).Conclusion: The excitability of the spinal motor neurons in patients with DOC following TBI was reduced after acupuncture treatment, suggesting that it is beneficial for reducing spastic muscle hypertonia in these patients."
"AbstractObjectives: This study explores the effects of vortex-water transpired from indoor greenery to office air, in relation to heart rate and heart rate variability during exposure to an electromagnetic field (EMF) from a visual display terminal (VDT).Design: The study followed a randomized prospective single group cross-over design.Subjects: Fifty (50) healthy volunteers, seated in any ordinary working posture in front of a VDT.Intervention: Electrocardiography was measured in five 10-minute sequential tests. The VDT was turned off during the first test and switched on for the subsequent four tests. During tests 3 and 4, one of two Begonia Eliator plants, irrigated with either tap water or vortex-rotated (active) tap water during growth, was placed adjacent to the VDT. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and power spectral density (PSD) were analyzed.Results: The heart rate was unchanged at the start of EMF exposure. The time domain measurements indicated a significant decrease in heart rate and a significant increase in HRV, accompanied by higher vagal tone in the presence, and finally in the absence, of the active plant. PSD parameters revealed significantly higher total power, as well as an increase in low frequencies (LF) and high frequencies (HF) in the condition induced by the active plant as well as after its removal. Very low frequencies (VLF) increased at EMF exposure whereas normally HF power decreased, accompanied by a rise in LF power and LF/HF ratio. HF power was higher at exposure to the active compared to the control plant. Spectral power density diagrams revealed an intensified spectral power band at frequencies of around 0.1 Hz at the condition of both plants, indicating systemic autonomic stability.Conclusions: The findings suggest that the parasympathetic response was associated with reduced heart rate, implicating restoration and maintenance of metabolic energy resources mediated by an involuntary adaptation to active plant-related stimuli."
"AbstractObjectives: In 2007, Craig et al. reported the results of a randomized controlled trial in which a standardized acupuncture protocol performed on the day of embryo transfer (ET) resulted in lower pregnancy rates after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Between 2005 and 2007, the Craig protocol was used by one of the authors (LHR) at an infertility clinic unaffiliated with the Craig et al. trial. The objective was to retrospectively review clinic records to evaluate the effect of the Craig protocol in both donor and nondonor IVF cycles on four outcomes: (1) live births; (2) biochemical pregnancies; (3) adverse outcomes; and (4) live births in nondonor cycles across age groups established by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.Design: The study design was a retrospective chart review.Setting: The study was conducted at a private infertility clinic.Patient(s): Patients underwent fresh, donor (N=70) or nondonor (N=402) IVF-ET.Intervention(s): The Craig protocol included the following points before ET: GV-20, CV-6, ST-29, SP-8, PC-6, LV-3; Shenmen and Brain on the left ear; and Uterus and Endocrine on the right ear. After transfer the points were LI-4, SP-10, ST-36, SP-6, KI-3; Uterus and Endocrine on the left ear; and Shenmen and Brain on the right ear.Main outcome measure(s): Live births (LB) beyond 24 weeks' gestation was the main outcome measure.Result(s): In nondonor IVF cycles, there were no differences in LB across age groups (odds ratio [OR]=1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–1.57), biochemical pregnancies (OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.27–1.33), or adverse outcomes (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.31–1.26). In donor cycles, LB were higher in the acupuncture group (relative risk=1.31, 95% CI 1.02–1.71).Conclusions: In this observational study, the Craig protocol was not found to lower IVF LB. In fact, the Craig protocol was associated with higher LB in donor cycles. These findings should be considered cautiously because more adequately powered, randomized research is needed."
"AbstractObjective: The objective was to investigate the effect of three different modes of stimulation on: (1) the electrical conductance of a known acupuncture point (AP) and a point with no known acupuncture function (NP); and (2) the corresponding characteristicvs of de qi sensations.Design: The design was prospective.Settings and Locations: Healthy subjects were recruited for the study at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center.Subjects and Study Interventions: Fifteen subjects were enrolled. Two locations of the subjects’ nondominant hand were marked: (1) AP (Li4); and (2) NP, a control location with no known acupuncture function. The following different stimulation paradigms were applied to the testing sites in a randomized fashion: (1) transcutaneous electrical stimulation via an ECG electrode; (2) manual stimulation via an acupuncture needle; and (3) electrical stimulation via an acupuncture needle. All electrical stimulation was provided at 12 V and 5 Hz for 30 seconds.Outcome Measures: The conductance before and after each stimulation were measured. The subjects were asked to choose four most predominant descriptors of the de qi sensation after the stimulation and to rate the corresponding intensity on a linear VAS.Results: The conductance values at the AP site are generally a bit higher than conductance values at the NP site for each given stimulation type. The de qi VAS score increased significantly after needle electrical stimulation (EA) in comparison to electrode or manual stimulation at both sites. The most predominant (incidence >30%) de qi sensation with electrical stimulation in either electrode or needle electrical stimulation was tingling, whereas in the manual stimulation, aching was the most predominant sensation of de qi.Conclusions: The de qi sensation appears to be qualitatively and quantitatively different between manual and electrical stimulation. The observed difference in transcutaneous electrical conductance betwee"
"AbstractObjective: The specific sensations (deqi) generated during acupuncture are thought to be important for a positive clinical outcome, particularly when treating pain. It is important to be able to measure these sensations and discriminate between deqi and pain. A greater understanding of this will greatly aid researchers who wish to conduct mechanistic studies of acupuncture. Previous questionnaire designs failed to consider patient experience and, hence, may have been flawed. The aim of this study was to generate and validate a new sensation questionnaire, that was able to discriminate between pain and deqi, taking into account patient experience and expert opinions.Design: The questionnaire was designed following qualitative interviews with patients, literature review, and consultation with experts. The questionnaire was piloted and then validated. It was successfully completed by 227 patients and analyzed using factor analysis and partial correlation.Setting: Patients were recruited via the physical therapy department at Southampton General Hospital and from private practice clinics in and around the Southampton area.Subjects: The subjects were patients receiving acupuncture for any condition.Results: Two (2) factors were clearly demonstrated: “Aching deqi” (7 items) which suggested deqi with pain and “Tingling deqi” (7 items) suggesting deqi only. One (1) item related solely to pain and 2 further items did not load into any factor.Conclusions: The final questionnaire is presented containing 17 items and is shown to be a valid, rigorous, soundly grounded, and patient-centered measure, capable of accurately recording deqi. We suggest that analysis should include a partial correlation of certain sensations against a pain visual analogue scale to ascertain how painful each sensation was, particularly if the questionnaire is to be used in a context in which pain and deqi need to be separated or their relationship clarified."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to characterize the role of Ting points (TP) in acute pain management and its potential use in functional imaging studies by quantitatively assessing: (1) the change in peripheral thermal thresholds before and after the electroacupuncture (EA); and (2) the corresponding behavioral feedback of thermal pain stimulation and the de qi sensation of EA.Design: The study design was prospective.Settings/location: Healthy subjects were recruited for the study at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center.Subjects/interventions: Thirteen (13) healthy subjects were studied. Baseline thermal thresholds (cold and warm sensations and cold and hot pain) were measured at premarked testing sites along the medial aspects of bilateral lower extremities. Five (5) seconds of hot pain (HP) was delivered to the testing sites and the corresponding pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded. Thirty (30) seconds of EA was delivered via the SP1 and LR1 on the left lower extremities at 5 Hz via a 6-V square-wave stimulator.Outcome measures: The VAS scores of the HP and de qi sensation (tingling) during the EA were recorded. The thermal thresholds and VAS scores for the HP and de qi were obtained immediately and both 30 and 60 minutes after the EA. Adaptation testing was also carried out to assess the change in thermal thresholds and the VAS scores of HP without EA.Results: The warm thresholds of bilateral medial calves significantly increased (p < 0.01) after 30 seconds of EA stimulation. The HP VAS score reduced significantly at the ipsilateral calf during EA in comparison to preacupuncture and postacupuncture (p < 0.01) measurements. No significant change in thermal thresholds was noted in the adaptation paradigm.Conclusions: EA at the TP has an inhibitory effect on the C-fiber afferents. The analgesic benefit observed is most likely A-δ afferent mediated. Further correlation studies in functional imaging may provide defining data for the observed analgesic mechanism."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aimed to identify the acupressure effect over time, compare the efficacy in different dosages, and identify feasibility issues with saliva sample collection and acupressure implementation in agitated nursing home residents with dementia.Design: Time serial design with eight dosage-combination groups.Setting: Three residential care homes (RCHs) in Hong Kong.Participants: Agitated RCH residents with dementia.Interventions: Acupressure was performed for 9 minutes altogether on five acupoints: Fengchi (GB 20), Baihui (GV 20), Shenmen (HT 7), Niguan (PC 6), and Yingtang (EX-HN 3). Two frequencies (once and twice a day) and four durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks) formed eight dosage combinations.Outcome measures: The primary outcome was agitation, measured by the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The secondary outcome was stress, measured by salivary cortisol.Results: Twenty-four participants from three RCHs completed the study. Acupressure was successfully completed for 88% of total sessions, and 79.17% of participants completed more than 80% of expected sessions. The effect of acupressure on agitation onset was seen immediately at week 1 (p < 0.001), resurged at week 4 (p = 0.001), and was sustained until week 6 (p < 0.001). The effect on stress began immediately to a mild extent at week 1 (p = 0.011) and peaked at week 4 (p = 0.010). Acupressure was observed to show the largest effect when it was performed twice a day (p = 0.026) for 2 weeks (p = 0.005). Valid saliva samples were collected for 53.33% of participants. Hyposalivation caused this unsatisfactory yield of valid saliva samples.Conclusion: Acupressure can be conducted on agitated RCH residents with dementia, but low yield of saliva samples related to participants' hyposalivation is a problem. Preliminary findings suggest that acupressure is effective in reducing both agitation and stress. Its onset of effect was immediate, and the effect was sustained until 6 weeks after the intervention. The optimal dosage appears to be a course of acupressure twice a day for 2 weeks."
"AbstractBackground: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, is currently one of the most common diagnoses given to children. Children with ADHD have a unique cognitive profile that involves difficulties in executive functions (EFs) and in the self-management system of the brain, and are at higher risk for educational failure, social and emotional difficulties, and high risk behavior.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of self-management intervention for attention and executive functions using equine-assisted occupational therapy (STABLE-OT) for school-aged children with ADHD.Design: A pre–post design was used in the intervention.Setting/location: The study was conducted at two riding school stables is Israel.Subjects: Twenty-five 6–14-year-old children (3 girls, 22 boys, age: 7.8–12.3 years, M = 9.41 ± 1.75) diagnosed with ADHD participated in a therapeutic equestrian riding intervention.Intervention: The intervention included structured 45-min sessions for 12 weeks, while integrating child- and family-centered strategy acquisition and immediate feedback principles.Outcome measures: Their EF and occupational performance were evaluated pre- and post-intervention, using The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).Results: Results showed a significant improvement in EF, as reflected by statistically significant decreases in the Global Executive Composite (GEC; t = 2.801; p = 0.01), metacognitive index (t = 3.873; p = 0.001), working memory (t = 2.476; p = 0.021), monitor (t = 2.359; p = 0.027), and initiation (t = 3.204; p = 0.004) subscales of the BRIEF questionnaire. A statistically (p < 0.001) and clinically significant improvement was also found in the COPM performance and satisfaction scales.Conclusions: This study provides key preliminary evidence supporting the effectiveness of an individual equine-assisted OT intervention for children with ADHD. It constitutes an initial step toward clinical implementation of such therapeutic approaches, and is expected to spark further research in this area."
"AbstractBackground: Survey findings report that 48% of people with type 2 diabetes use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practice. Publications suggest a high incidence of health promotion counseling in naturopathic practice, yet clinical data on risk factor changes are not available in the literature.Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to describe clinical risk factor changes during the utilization of naturopathic CAM services in patients with type 2 diabetes.Design: A retrospective, observational study design was used to describe naturopathic care.Setting: Abstracted medical charts were from patients of the Bastyr Center for Natural Health in Seattle, WA.Participants: The patients in this study had type 2 diabetes and received naturopathic care between 2001 and 2006.Outcomes: Abstracted data included patient demographics, duration of care, number of visits, laboratory values for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TAG); and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SPB, DBP).Results: Thirty-seven (37) patient records met inclusion criteria and were abstracted in detail. Mean and median duration of care were 27 and 20 months, respectively. The mean number of visits was 11. Significant mean changes in clinical laboratory risk factors over the duration of care were: −0.65% for HbA1c (p = 0.046), −45 mg/dL for TAG (p = 0.037), −7 mm Hg in SBP (p = 0.02), and −5 mm Hg in DBP (p = 0.003). Mean changes for cholesterol did not reach statistical significance. The percentage of patients who reached new control, had clinically significant risk factor improvements, or had any improvement was: 26%, 42%, and 68% for HbA1c, 7%, 28%, and 62% for LDL, 0%, 25%, and 39% for HDL, 14%, 38%, and 52% for TAG, 16%, 51%, and 86% for SBP, and 27%, 54%, and 70% for DBP.Comments/conclusions: These preliminary outcomes suggest that risk factor improvements occur during naturopathic care for diabetes, although the contribution of naturopathic care to these changes cannot be determined. Effectiveness and generalizability of naturopathic approaches in treating type 2 diabetes should be evaluated in controlled prospective studies in representative populations or randomized trials."
"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the acute and chronic effects of yoga practice.Design: Quantitative study using a one-group pre–posttest design.Setting: Visão Futuro Institute, Porangaba, São Paulo, Brazil.Participants: 22 volunteers (7 men and 15 women).Intervention: Six weeks of a tantric yoga program (TYP), 50 minutes per session, held twice a week from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. The local ethics committee approved the protocol.Outcome measures: Data were collected in the first week and at the end of the sixth week of TYP. Salivary cortisol concentration (SCC) was used to measure physiology of distress and to analyze the short- and long-term effects of TYP. Psychological distress was evaluated by applying a specific perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ). Results (mean±standard deviation) were analyzed by Wilcoxon test (p<0.05).Results: SCC decreased 24% after the first (0.66±0.20 μg/dL versus 0.50±0.13 μg/dL) and last (1.01±0.37 versus 0.76±0.31 μg/dL) sessions, showing the short-term effect of yoga. Long-term effects were analyzed by daily rhythm of cortisol production. In the beginning, volunteers showed altered SCC during the day, with nighttime values (0.42±0.28) higher than those at noon (0.30±0.06). After the TYP, SCC was higher in the morning (1.01±0.37) and decreased during the day, with lower values before sleep (0.30±0.13). The TYP was also efficient to reduce PSQ scores (0.45±0.13 versus 0.39±0.07). Specifically, the irritability, tension, and fatigue domains on the PSQ decreased (0.60±0.20 versus 0.46±0.13), as did the fear and anxiety domains (0.54±0.30 versus 0.30±0.20).Conclusion: Over the short term, TYP led to the decrease of cortisol production. Over the long term, TYP induced higher cortisol production in the morning and lower production in the evening. Those effects contributed to the physical and mental well-being of the participants."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of therapeutic horseback riding on behavior, health-related quality of life, and motor performance in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Design: The study employed a time series quasi-experimental design with two pretests and two post-tests conducted 8 weeks apart.Setting/location: The study was conducted at a riding school in Levanger, Norway.Subjects: The subjects comprised a convenience sample of 5 children aged 10–11 years with ADHD.Methods: Subjects received a 1-hour therapeutic horseback riding twice a week for 8 weeks as intervention.Outcome measures: Behavior and health-related quality of life was assessed using Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and The KINDLR–Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. The Modified Function-Neurological Assessment and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children assessed the subject's motor performance.Results: The pre- and post-tests scores were compared with the Wilcoxon paired sample tests and the Friedman test for nonparametric multiple test samples. Positive differences (p≤0.05) between the test results at pretest 2 and post-test 1 were noted for the behavior SDQ subscore “Total difficulties” reported by children (12.8±5.8), by parents (16.6±8.2), and by teachers (15.0±5.2). A significant difference (p<0.05) for the “Total difficulties” in SDQ was found between all 4 tests. In relation to quality of life, significant differences in the “Total score” (67.2±14.7) were reported by the children themselves. The motor performance improved after the intervention. The effect sizes and power were established.Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that therapeutic horseback riding had a positive effect on 5 children with ADHD in several domains of the social role behavior, quality of life, and motor performance. This pilot study constitutes a good scientific prospect for future studies."
"AbstractObjectives: Few investigations have examined the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract for enhancing cognitive abilities in individuals with no history of significant neurocognitive dysfunction. The purpose of this research was to examine the relatively short-term (i.e., 6 weeks) efficacy of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 on the cognitive functioning of cognitively intact persons over the age of 55 years via a diverse battery of neuropsychologic tests and measures.Participants: From the 48 cognitively intact participants between the ages of 55 and 86 years who initially enrolled in this study, 21 males and 19 females successfully completed the study's protocol and provided valid data sets.Design: A 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group experimental design was utilized. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 (180 mg/d) or placebo control group. To evaluate participants' cognitive and behavioral functioning, series of neuropsychological tests were administered to them prior to the initiation of the Ginkgo biloba extract/placebo therapy (i.e., pretreatment baseline) and again, just prior to the termination of the treatment regimen (i.e., after 6 weeks).Results: Participants who received 180 mg of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 daily for 6 weeks exhibited significantly more improvement on a task assessing speed of processing abilities (i.e., Stroop Color and Word Test color-naming task) by the end of treatment as compared to participants who received placebo. Trends favoring improved performances in the Ginkgo biloba group were also demonstrated in three of the four remaining tasks that involved a timed, speed of processing component, although they did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, a significant relationship was found between the type of treatment (Ginkgo biloba extract or placebo) and participants' ratings of their overall abilities to remember. Specifically, more participants in the Ginkgo biloba extract group rated their overall abilities to remember by the end of treatment as ""improved,"" as compared to the placebo group. In contrast, no significant differences were found between the Ginkgo biloba and placebo groups by treatment end on any of the four objective memory measures.Conclusions: Taken together, the findings from standardized neuropsychologic assessment and a subjective, self-report questionnaire suggested that relatively short-term (i.e., 6 weeks) utilization of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 may prove efficacious in enhancing certain neurocognitive functions/processes of cognitively intact older adults."
"AbstractBackground: Patients who include a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioner in their health care represent a small percentage of the population identified as CAM users. Their choice may be motivated by intangible personality or worldview characteristics.Objective: A prospective study was designed to determine if a patient's choice of conventional or alternative health care practitioner was related to total score on an instrument for scaling psychospiritual characteristics.Design: A sequential convenience sample of patients attending five different health care practices in New England.Setting: A family practitioner (FP) who uses CAM. (1) A FP clearly not identified with CAM. (3) A chiropractor. (4) A naturopath, and (5) A homeopath.Outcome measures: Total scores on the Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale (SIBS), plus item scores of five separate questions and two factors.Results: With 210 respondents, SIBS scores in Practice 2 were significantly lower than in practice 1 (p = 0.004), 3 (p = 0.001), 4 (p = 0.018), and 5 (p = 0.02). This pattern remained over the five question scores and two factors.Conclusion: Patients who chose a physician associated with CAM, or an alternative practitioner (chiropractor, naturopath, or homeopath) for their direct health care scored higher on a psychospiritual testing instrument (SIBS) than those who chose a conventional physician."
"AbstractObjective: Given the dearth of literature on this topic, the aim of this study was to understand who chooses to study integrative healthcare at an academic institution and why they choose to do so, the demographic characteristics of the student population, their background, and postgraduate plans.Design: A cross-sectional survey design.Setting: Data were collected at a large, urban, public university with a well-established undergraduate bachelor of science program in integrative healthcare.Participants: A total of 105 declared integrative health undergraduate majors.Measurements: Online research software collected anonymous survey responses during a 2-month period.Results: Survey participants were more likely to be white and full-time students compared with the general undergraduate population. Many respondents discovered the integrative health major and then decided to enroll at the university. Most had used complementary and alternative medicine modalities, such as massage, yoga, and meditation. More than half of the survey participants were dissatisfied with conventional/Western medicine and its providers. Most respondents had a personal interest in complementary and alternative medicine and holistic health that influenced their decision to declare the major. Additionally, more than half of the respondents want to become a complementary and alternative medicine provider. Most survey participants plan to pursue postgraduate training/education in an integrative healthcare–related field.Conclusion: Students who choose to study integrative healthcare in an undergraduate academic institution may mirror the patient population of complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Their profile, rationale, exposures, intentions, and directions may be helpful to universities considering adding this type of program or postgraduate education programs in attracting new students to integrative health fields. It also informs existing integrative healthcare programs regarding program enhancement. A larger sample involving more integrative health academic institutions would be useful for a future study."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to determine whether giving a massage had an impact of the mental state of the massage therapist.Design: The design of this study was a randomized, controlled, blinded study with two parallel groups.Settings/location: This study was conducted at an accredited school of therapeutic massage in Dallas, Texas.Subjects: The study comprised healthy female and male final-term massage students between ages 18 and 65 years.Interventions: The participants were randomized into two groups: (1) the experimental group who gave a 1-hour Swedish massage to a massage client (Massage group), or (2) the control group who sat in a room doing normal, daily activities (Control group). Both these activities were a normal part of the daily routine for these massage students.Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the change in the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) scores pre- and postparticipation.Results: Twenty-two (22) participants were randomized in this trial. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. A statistically significant advantage for the massage group was found relative to the control group in subjective anxiety (DASS Anxiety Subscale, p=0.014). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to total DASS score (p=0.540), subjective depressive symptoms (DASS Depression Subscale, p=0.472) and subjective stress-related symptoms (DASS Stress Subscale, p=0.919). There were no adverse events reported by any participant.Conclusions: This study shows that massage therapists themselves may benefit from giving a therapeutic massage by experiencing less subjective anxiety following the giving of a massage."
"AbstractObjectives: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a well-known student-centered instructional approach that is known to enhance problem-solving skills among the learners. Because teaching/learning methods in most of the Ayurveda colleges in India are still didactic and teacher centric, the effects of introducing PBL have not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to develop PBL modules for Kriya Sharira (Ayurveda Physiology) and their implementation in a hybrid format. In this method, PBL is used as an add-on component along with didactic lectures. The secondary objective of the study was to compare the learning outcomes achieved through hybrid problem-based learning (HPBL) with those achieved through conventional teaching.Design: This is a prospectively planned post-test-only, controlled interventional design with nonequivalent groups. However, the results have been analyzed in a retrospective manner.Subjects: Students enrolled in the first professional Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery program during two consecutive academic sessions 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 at the Banaras Hindu University were included in the study. While the cohort from 2016 to 2017 session served as the control group, the one from 2017 to 2018 session served as the experimental group.Interventions: The instructional method commonly known as HPBL was introduced to the experimental group.Outcome measures: Five test papers containing mostly Multiple Choice Questions for five different topics were used as the tools for evaluating the learning outcomes in both the groups. Feedback forms regarding the experiences of undergoing HPBL were obtained from experimental group.Results: While the test results for three topics showed that the outcomes of HPBL were comparable with conventional teaching, the results on other two topics suggested that HPBL was slightly better. Feedback obtained showed that there is a considerable acceptance for HPBL over conventional method.Conclusions: The study shows that it is possible to implement HPBL method in a large classroom in the context of Ayurveda education. The findings also indicate that students find HPBL as an acceptable teaching method."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary effects of a vocal music therapy (VMT) program on chronic pain management.Design: A mixed methods intervention design was used in which qualitative data were embedded within a randomized controlled trial.Setting: An urban nurse-management health center on the East Coast of the United States.Subjects: Participants (N = 43) were predominantly Black (79%) and female (76.7%) with an average pain duration of 10 years.Intervention: Participants were randomly allocated to a 12-week VMT program or a waitlist control.Outcome measures: We tracked consent rate (percentage of participants enrolled out of total number screened), attrition rate, and treatment adherence. We used PROMIS® (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) tools to measure pain interference, pain-related self-efficacy, pain intensity, depression, anxiety, positive effect, and well-being, ability to participate in social activities, and satisfaction with social roles at baseline and week 12. VMT participants also completed the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. We conducted semistructured interviews to better understand participants' experience of the intervention.Results: The consent rate was 56%. The attrition rate was 23%. Large treatment effects (partial eta squared) were obtained for self-efficacy (0.20), depression (0.26), and ability to participate in social activities (0.24). Medium effects were found for pain intensity (0.10), anxiety (0.06), positive effect, and well-being (0.06), and small effects for pain interference (0.03) and satisfaction with social roles (0.03). On average, participants felt moderately better after completion of the VMT program (M = 4.93, standard deviation = 1.98). Qualitative findings suggest that VMT resulted in better self-management of pain, enhanced psychological well-being, and stronger social and spiritual connections.Conclusions: Recruitment into the 12-week program was challenging, but quantitative and qualitative findings suggest significant benefits of VMT for chronic pain management."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to explore client perceptions of the short-term and longer-term effects of shiatsu.Design: The study design was a prospective, 6-month observational, pragmatic study.Setting: There were 85 shiatsu practitioners in three countries involved in the study: Austria, Spain, and the United Kingdom.Subjects: There were 948 clients receiving shiatsu from 1 of these practitioners.Interventions:Shiatsu as delivered by the practitioner in routine practice.Outcome measures: The outcomes measures were symptom severity, changes in health care use (baseline, 3 and 6 months), shiatsu-specific effects, uptake of advice (3 and 6 months), achieved expectations and occurrence of adverse events (4–6 days after first session, 3 and 6 months).Results: Six hundred and thirty-three (633) clients provided full follow-up data (a response rate of 67%). A typical shiatsu user was female, in her 40s, in paid employment, and had used shiatsu before. At “first-ever” use, the most typical reason for trying shiatsu was “out of curiosity.” At “today's” session, the dominant reason was health maintenance. The most mentioned symptom groups were problems with “muscles, joints, or body structure,” “tension/stress,” and “low energy/fatigue.” Symptom scores improved significantly over the 6 months (all symptom groups, Austria and the United Kingdom; two symptom groups, Spain), with moderate effect sizes (0.66–0.77) for “tension or stress” and “body structure problems” (Austria, the United Kingdom), and small effect sizes (0.32–0.47) for the other symptom groups (Spain, 0.28–0.43 for four groups). Previous users reported significant symptom improvement from “first ever” to baseline with moderate effect sizes. Across countries, substantial proportions (≥ 60%) agreed or agreed strongly with shiatsu-specific benefits. At 6 months, 77%–80% indicated that they had made changes to their lifestyle as a result of having shiatsu, and reductions in the use of conventional medicine (16%–22%) and medication (15%–34%). Ten (10) adverse events were reported by 9 clients (1.4%); none of these clients ceased shiatsu.Conclusions: Clients receiving shiatsu reported improvements in symptom severity and changes in their health-related behaviour that they attributed to their treatment, suggestive of a role for shiatsu in maintaining and enhancing health."
"AbstractObjective: The study objective was to assess the effects and tolerability of two novel natural medicine formulations in improving bowel habit and abdominal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The DA-IBS formula was designed to treat diarrhea-predominant and alternating bowel habit IBS, and the C-IBS formula was designed to treat constipation-predominant IBS.Design: This was a two arm, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study.Settings/location: Subjects were recruited from the greater Lismore area (NSW, Australia) in 2001.Subjects: The study included 31 patients who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Twenty-one (21) patients were classified as suffering from diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS and 10 patients were classified with constipation-predominant IBS.Interventions: The DA-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried, powdered bilberry fruit, slippery elm bark, agrimony aerial parts, and cinnamon quills. The C-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried powdered slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root. The aim of each formula was to normalize stool frequency and stool consistency.Results: Ingestion of the DA-IBS formula was associated with a small, but significant increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.027). Subjects in the DA-IBS group also experienced reductions in straining (p = 0.004), abdominal pain (p = 0.006), bloating (p < 0.0001), flatulence (p = 0.0001), and global IBS symptoms (p = 0.002) during the treatment phase of the trial. Subjects in the C-IBS group experienced a 20% increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.016) and significant reductions in straining (p < 0.0001), abdominal pain (p = 0.032), bloating (p = 0.034), and global IBS symptom severity (p = 0.0005), as well as improvements in stool consistency (p < 0.0001). Both formulas were well-tolerated.Conclusions: The DA-IBS formula was not effective in improving bowel habit in individuals with diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit IBS, although it did significantly improve a number of IBS symptoms. The C-IBS formula significantly improved both bowel habit and IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Further research is warranted on C-IBS, as a potentially useful therapeutic formula."
"AbstractObjectives: This study was designed to investigate the effect of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) on adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells at the cellular and molecular levels.Design:          Various concentrations of hibiscus extract were added to confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at the outset of the differentiation program and further incubated for 36 hours. Cells were maintained in postdifferentiation          medium containing insulin with hibiscus extract in complete culture medium.Results: Hibiscus extract inhibited the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced by insulin, dexamethasone,          and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) in a dose-dependent manner. Hibiscus blocked the cytoplasmic lipid accumulation when administered at the onset of differentiation and 4 days after induction of differentiation.          The inhibitory effect of hibiscus on adipogenic lipid accumulation of preadipocytes was significant (p < 0.01) between control cells and cells treated with hibiscus. Hibiscus extract significantly          attenuated the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors, including CCAAT element binding protein (C/EBP)α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ at protein          levels.Conclusion: These results suggest that hibiscus extract blocks adipogenesis, in part, by its suppression on the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, including C/EBPα          and PPARγ.

"AbstractObjectives: This study examined the extent to which people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV) taking combination antiretroviral therapy used complementary therapy, and the relationship of their reported          symptoms to the use of complementary therapy and health-related outcomes.Design: A descriptive design was used in which data were obtained from individual interviews and medical records.Settings:          PLWHIV were identified through flyers distributed in five HIV clinics in urban and suburban locations in a Western state of the United States.Subjects: The sample consisted of 182 people living          with HIV/AIDS, self-identified as white (24.12%), black (44%), and Hispanic (31.88%) with a mean age of 38 (range, 22-66) years. The majority (n = 160; 87.91%) was using as least one category of          complementary therapy. Approximately 56% were experiencing symptoms from HIV or their treatment, and 51% discussed their complementary therapy therapies with their health care providers.Outcome          measure: Three categories of complementary therapy - physical/body-mind therapies, religion, herbs and supplements - and two health-related outcomes - CD4 count and viral load - were explored.Results:          Complementary therapy use was associated with higher education, being Christian, white or black, and working part or full time. Significantly more PLWHIV with symptoms used physical/body-mind therapies          than those without symptoms. No differences were found between users and nonusers of complementary therapy with respect to CD4 count and viral load. The use of herbs/supplements was significantly associated          with the use of protease inhibitors. Among the categories of complementary therapy, religion, especially prayers, were most frequently used.Conclusions: A substantial proportion of PLWHIV reported          using complementary therapy, most predominantly religion (specifically prayers). Further study is recommended to explore the PLWHIV's perceived benefits of using complementary therapy, and to examine the          effect of complementary therapy on the patients' symptoms and disease progression. Health care providers need to be alert to potentials of interactions between combination antiretroviral therapies and specific          complementary therapy in PLWHIV.      "
"AbstractObjectives: Side-effects of standard pain medications can limit their use. Therefore, nonpharmacologic pain relief techniques such as auriculotherapy may play an important role in pain management. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating auriculotherapy for pain management.Design: MEDLINE,® ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane Library were searched through December 2008. Randomized trials comparing auriculotherapy to sham, placebo, or standard-of-care control were included that measured outcomes of pain or medication use and were published in English. Two (2) reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, quality, and abstracted data to a standardized form. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for studies using a pain score or analgesic requirement as a primary outcome.Results: Seventeen (17) studies met inclusion criteria (8 perioperative, 4 acute, and 5 chronic pain). Auriculotherapy was superior to controls for studies evaluating pain intensity (SMD, 1.56 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85, 2.26]; 8 studies). For perioperative pain, auriculotherapy reduced analgesic use (SMD, 0.54 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.77]; 5 studies). For acute pain and chronic pain, auriculotherapy reduced pain intensity (SMD for acute pain, 1.35 [95% CI: 0.08, 2.64], 2 studies; SMD for chronic pain, 1.84 [95% CI: 0.60, 3.07], 5 studies). Removal of poor quality studies did not alter the conclusions. Significant heterogeneity existed among studies of acute and chronic pain, but not perioperative pain.Conclusions: Auriculotherapy may be effective for the treatment of a variety of types of pain, especially postoperative pain. However, a more accurate estimate of the effect will require further large, well-designed trials."
"AbstractObjective: The goal of the present study was to obtain a standard list of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptoms and signs for screening chronic low back pain (cLBP) from a group of experts and to assess agreement and consistency among their opinions on the items of a questionnaire.Design, settings, and subjects: The study design involved three rounds of modified Delphi technique, and it was carried out by 13 experts in orthopedics, massage, and acupuncture working in four hospitals affiliated with Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, ChinaOutcome measures: The outcome was measured on the 5-score Likert-scale self-administered checklists.Results: A review of eight textbooks identified 12 pain characteristics, 11 associated factors, and 25 physical and tongue diagnostic expressions as important factors in the TCM diagnosis of cLBP. These 48 diagnostic characteristics were rated by 13 experts as “not important” to “very important” on a scale of 1–5. After three rounds of rating, 13 characteristics were eliminated from the list, with the final numbers for each group being 8, 11, and 16, respectively. Seven items based on Western medicine were also added by the experts. The intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient for agreement among the experts was 0.2 at the end. Intra-rater, between rounds, consecutive pair-wise median kappa values were 0.53 and 0.66. Analysis of variance using items appearing in all three rounds revealed significant effects of expert and group of symptoms and signs (p < 0.001) and nonsignificant differences among scores of the same expert in the three rounds (p = 0.97). Mean score of physical and tongue expressions was significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that of all other groups of symptoms and signs.Conclusions: Modern TCM experts have de-emphasized the items on physical and tongue expressions and have adopted instead those from Western medicine. Intra-expert agreement across items was low, and each expert tended to stick to her/his original opinions."
"AbstractBackground: The physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy can lead to a variety of conditions that can usually be self-treated. There are no licensed medicines for conditions such as morning sickness or insomnia in pregnancy, and evidence from Western countries suggests that patients often resort to using herbal medicines. Research on the health behaviors of pregnant women in the United Kingdom with respect to herbal remedies has not been undertaken.Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the use and the user of herbal remedies during pregnancy and to study the sources of information about herbs used.Design: The study design was a survey among expectant mothers more than 20 weeks pregnant presenting at an antenatal clinic.Setting: The setting was an antenatal clinic and antenatal ultrasound department at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. One thousand and thirty-seven (1037) questionnaires were handed out between November 2007 and February 2008.Results: Five hundred and seventy-eight (578) questionnaires were returned (55.7%). Three hundred and thirty-four (334) of the 578 respondents (57.8%) reported using herbal remedies during pregnancy with a mean of 1.2 remedies per woman (median: 1, range: 0–10). The most commonly used remedies were ginger, cranberry, and raspberry leaf. The most probable user had been pregnant before and had a university degree. “Family and friends” were the most frequently cited source of information about herbal remedies during pregnancy, and more than 75% of the users reportedly did not tell their doctor or midwife about the use.Conclusions: A large percentage of the women in the study used herbal remedies during pregnancy—many of them without informing their doctor or midwife. Doctors or midwives should ask pregnant women if they use herbal remedies during pregnancy. Health care personnel should be open to discuss the use of herbal remedies during pregnancy and be able to give balanced information as the use is so widespread."
"AbstractObjectives: Despite recent shifts in regulation and recognition of the role that naturopathy plays in health care delivery in Canada, comparatively little research has been conducted regarding individuals who conduct naturopathy-related research. A survey was undertaken to better understand the needs and capacity of these individuals to conduct more research.Design, Setting, and Subjects: The Naturopathy Special Interest Group (N-SIG) of the Interdisciplinary Network of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (INCAM) Researchers created and distributed a survey of individuals interested in naturopathy-related research to assess gaps between current and desired research activity and needs for further participation.Outcome measures: Results from a previous pilot study (2014; n = 58) were used to inform the design and distribution. This study received approval and oversight from the Research Ethics Board of the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine.Results: The survey was completed by 201 individuals (∼5%–10% of all naturopathic doctors and naturopathy researchers in Canada). The majority (70%) had no peer-reviewed publication experience; however, 63% reported having published in a nonpeer-reviewed medium. Respondents reported differing levels of confidence in completing various components of a research project. Frequently selected obstacles included lack of time due to professional and personal obligations, as well as insufficient training, funding, and mentorship. The greatest identified needs for participation in research were mentorship/support, access to a wider degree of scientific journals, and targeted funding opportunities for CAM research. Overall, the results of this survey suggest that there is interest in further conducting naturopathy-related research in Canada. There are individuals who are already involved and have expressed skills in the area of evidence-based medicine. Mentorship, research training, resources, and critical appraisal and writing skills may be important leverage points.Conclusion: Findings from this investigation will be used to inform an agenda for naturopathy-related research and activities of the N-SIG with respect to enhancing research capacity. Other CAM groups or geographic regions could consider using similar methodology to assess capacity and needs for research participation."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture and massage on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) among end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.Design: Pre–post test design.Setting: A hemodialysis (HD) unit located in a university hospital.Intervention: Participants were given the option to choose between 20 min sessions of massage or acupuncture therapy once a week for 8 weeks by licensed acupuncturists and massage therapists while undergoing their usual HD session in the University of California, San Diego Chronic HD unit.Outcome measures: Participants were asked to complete pre- and postintervention surveys, which consisted of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS™) Global Health Short Form and a Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale.Results: A total of 101 patients were included in this study. The average age was 57.6 (standard deviation: 14.5) dialysis vintage 7.5 years, 58% patients were male and the most common etiology of ESRD was diabetic nephropathy (45%). Patients had multiple comorbidities as can be expected for this population with the most common being hypertension (94%), diabetes mellitus (53%), and cardiovascular disease (53%).In this brief intervention study, we were able to find a trend toward improvement in overall HR-QOL as determined by the PROMIS score (p = 0.08). PROMIS mental raw score improved with intervention, which was statistically significant (p = 0.034).Conclusion: Use of complementary therapies such as massage and acupuncture during HD may contribute toward improvement of HR-QOL and thus should be considered when addressing overall health status of these patients."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the scale and scope of implementing electrophoton capture (EPC) analysis based on gas discharge visualization (GDV) technique in diverse medical applications and psychophysiology; to identify the range of applications in medicine; and to show in which areas the procedure can be useful to health professionals.Design: The design of the study is a systematic review.Methods: The database included articles published in peer-reviewed journals, proceedings of the international scientific congress “Science, Information, Spirit” (2003–2007), articles from the International Union of Medical and Applied Bioelectrography database, and proceedings of other conferences devoted to EPC or GDV, bioelectrography, and biophotonics. Search restrictions were human subjects, English or Russian language, and publication date from 2003 to 2007. All randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and systematic research reports (SRRs) were evaluated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and Jadad checklists.Results: The search yielded 136 articles addressing four different fields of medical and psychophysiologic applications of EPC (GDV). Among them were 26 SRR, 19 RCT, 18 case reports or case series, and 13 cohort studies. Thirteen (13) RCTs and 19 SRRs were rated “high” on the two conventional checklists.Conclusions: (1) The software and equipment EPC/GDV-complex is a convenient and easy-to-use device, easily allows examining patients with various pathologies and, therefore, offers a wide range of applications. (2) The GDV method has shown itself to be very fast (i.e., it is an “express-method” for studying states of the human organism). (3) Our review has revealed that GDV method can be implemented as an express method for assessment of treatment procedure effectiveness, evaluating emotional and physical conditions of people, and in many other fields."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the treatment of refractory sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), treatment of which remains a major clinical challenge.Design: The study design was descriptive research to document the effect of acupuncture in a series of SSHL cases.Setting: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of Kyung Hee University Hospital.Subjects: The subjects analyzed were 17 patients with refractory SSHL of more than 3 weeks after a failed trial of conventional treatment including corticosteroids.Interventions: Acupuncture sessions were performed twice a week using a modified Saam acupuncture formula and such acupoints as GV14, GV15, and others, in addition to usual patient care educations.Main outcome measures: Improvement was defined as increased hearing threshold from initial measurement by more than 20 dB in at least two contiguous frequencies of audiometric testing. An audiogram pattern was also analyzed.Results: The average refractory period before acupuncture treatment was 213.9 days (range 22–1460). First follow-up measurement after 9.5 times of acupuncture treatment for 29.9 days showed improvement in 4 of 16 cases examined (25.0%) and second follow-up measurement after 18.7 times of acupuncture treatment for 70.4 days in another 4 of 12 cases examined (33.3%). A total improvement rate after day 70.4 post initial visit was 47.1% (8 of 17 cases). As to the audiogram pattern, an ascending or midhumping pattern was related to a good prognosis, while a descending pattern was not.Conclusions: These findings suggest that acupuncture might be effective in refractory sensorineural hearing loss with failure of conventional therapy."
"AbstractObjectives: Pain induced by surgery is a dynamic symptom, which may be quite variable even in the same surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the analgesic effect of far infrared rays on the patients during the postoperative period of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The selection and application of analgesic methods after the orthopedic surgery are therefore valuable for advanced studies.Design: The quasi-experimental design with a total five consecutive days of far infrared ray (FIR) thermal therapy was employed in this study.Subjects: The study involved 41 participants assigned by register code entry on computer to either the intervention or the control group.Intervention: The FIR pads were applied on the acupoints of ST37 (Shang Chu Hsu), ST38 (Tiao Kou), ST39 (Hsia Chu Hsu), and ST40 (Feng Lung) of the patients involved in the experimental group from the third day to the fifth day after the TKA.Outcome measures: The analgesic effect was evaluated via the pain intensity of the numeric rating scale (NRS) level and serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and endothelin-1 (ET-1).Results: The FIR showed that the significant effects are on relieving pain and lowering the levels of IL-6 and ET-1. The results cannot only be the reference for the postoperative pain relief of TKA, but it can also be the database of another clinical application.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the FIR can lower the NRS of pain and thus reduce the discomfort experienced by the patient. Findings indicated that effective application of FIR decreased the serum level of IL-6 and ET-1, which represent the subjective indicator of pain."
"AbstractObjectives: Massage therapy is a multi–billion dollar industry in the United States with 8.7% of adults receiving at least one massage within the last year; yet, little is known about the physiologic effects of a single session of massage in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of a single session of Swedish massage on neuroendocrine and immune function. It was hypothesized that Swedish Massage Therapy would increase oxytocin (OT) levels, which would lead to a decrease in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) activity and enhanced immune function.Design: The study design was a head-to-head, single-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition. Serial measurements were performed to determine OT, arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.Setting: This research was conducted in an outpatient research unit in an academic medical center.Subjects: Medically and psychiatrically healthy adults, 18–45 years old, participated in this study.Intervention: The intervention tested was 45 minutes of Swedish Massage Therapy versus a light touch control condition, using highly specified and identical protocols.Outcome measures: The standardized mean difference was calculated between Swedish Massage Therapy versus light touch on pre- to postintervention change in levels of OT, AVP, ACTH, CORT, lymphocyte markers, and cytokine levels.Results: Compared to light touch, Swedish Massage Therapy caused a large effect size decrease in AVP, and a small effect size decrease in CORT, but these findings were not mediated by OT. Massage increased the number of circulating lymphocytes, CD 25+ lymphocytes, CD 56+ lymphocytes, CD4 + lymphocytes, and CD8+ lymphocytes (effect sizes from 0.14 to 0.43). Mitogen-stimulated levels of interleukin (IL)–1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-γ decreased for subjects receiving Swedish Massage Therapy versus light touch (effect sizes from −0.22 to −0.63). Swedish Massage Therapy decreased IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 levels relative to baseline measures.Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that a single session of Swedish Massage Therapy produces measurable biologic effects. If replicated, these findings may have implications for managing inflammatory and autoimmune conditions."
"AbstractBackground and objectives: The current pharmacological management of diabetic gastroparesis remains difficult. Acupuncture has been widely used for gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on solid gastric emptying time, serum gastrin, motilin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), fasting and postprandial blood glucose, and symptoms in patients with diabetic gastroparesis.Interventions: EA at the Zusanli (ST 36) and Hegu (LI 4) points and sham EA as control were administered by an experienced and licensed acupuncturist.Design: This was a pilot study with a randomized, single-blinded design.Subjects and setting: Nineteen (19) patients with type 2 diabetes who had had symptoms of gastroparesis for more than 3 months were included in the trial and randomized into two groups. Each group received EA (n = 9) or sham EA (n = 10) consisting of 4 sessions over 2 weeks.Outcome measures: Symptom severity was evaluated using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) at baseline, at the end of treatment, and 2 weeks after the end of the trial; solid-phase gastric half-emptying time was measured by scintigraphy; in addition, serum gastrin, motilin, PP, fasting, and postprandial blood glucose levels were also measured.Results: Gastric half-emptying time in 9 patients with diabetic gastroparesis was significantly shortened by EA treatment (143.8 ± 55.9 minutes versus 98.8 ± 28.6 minutes, p < 0.03). Half-emptying time did not change (98.9 ± 26.4 minutes versus 90.9 ± 24.8 minutes, p > 0.05) in the sham EA group. Symptom severity, as measured by GCSI total score, improved significantly both at the end of treatment (2.38 ± 0.56 versus 1.48 ± 0.19, p < 0.001) and 2 weeks after the end of the trial (2.38 ± 0.56 versus 1.65 ± 0.44, p < 0.01) when compared with the baseline in the EA group, but did not change from baseline with sham EA treatment. There were no significant changes in fasting and postprandial blood glucose, serum gastrin, motilin, and PP in both groups. No significant adverse events occurred.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that short-term EA at the Zusanli and Hegu points effectively reduces the dyspeptic symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis and accelerates solid gastric emptying. Sustained improvement in dyspeptic symptoms was observed at 2 weeks after the end of the trial. Its potential for treating gastroparesis may be explored, and a larger trial is required to draw definitive conclusions."
"AbstractObjectives: Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) programs have been shown to be beneficial to improve procedural skill acquisition. However, simulated procedure performance can be affected by a host of factors, including stress. This investigation examined the preliminary efficacy of bolstering an established SBML program for medical residents with a brief mindfulness intervention (called a PITSTOP) to reduce procedural stress and improve simulator performance.Design: The study employed a partially blinded, parallel-group, randomized, repeated-measures intention-to-treat design. Participants were blinded to the primary outcome (simulator performance) and instead were informed of the study's secondary outcome (stress prevention). The SBML faculty instructors and study investigators were blinded to participants' group assignment.Settings/location: Northwestern Memorial Hospitals of Chicago.Subjects: Twenty-six postgraduate year (PGY) 1 internal medicine residents enrolled in a required SBML central venous catheter (CVC) insertion training from June 2015 to January 2018 participated in the study.Interventions: SBML consists of a simulated skills pretest, deliberate practice, and a simulated skills post-test (within 1 week of pretest). PGY 1 participants were randomly assigned to the PITSTOP intervention (12-min PITSTOP mindfulness training video) or control group (12-min control video on ways to increase physical activity) before the SBML pretest.Outcome measures: The primary outcome was a comparison of each group's simulator performance during pre- and post-tests. Secondary outcomes were changes in groups' procedural stress during these tests (assessed using self-reported, instructor-rated, and physiologic indicators), and self-reported self-regulation outcomes.Results: Residents who watched the PITSTOP video before their SBML training made fewer procedural errors relative to controls during their pretest for intrajugular CVC insertion (p = 0.03). PITSTOP participants also had lower heart rate (p = 0.03) and less visible trembling (p = 0.003) relative to controls at the post-test.Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that a brief, mindfulness intervention may reduce stress during SBML training."
"AbstractObjectives: Previous research on complementary therapy use in populations of patients with breast cancer has failed to differentiate among the different types of therapies and utilization patterns, resulting in wide discrepancies in prevalence rates. The purpose of this study was to develop more refined and rigorous estimates of the prevalence of complementary therapy use in women with breast cancer and their level of commitment to complementary therapy.Design and sample/setting: Using a cross-sectional, retrospective survey design, a random sample of 334 women with breast cancer was drawn from a Canadian provincial cancer registry. Using an intensive therapy inventory, women were asked to indicate the therapies and practices they had used since cancer diagnosis, frequency of use, amount of effort associated with using each therapy, and financial cost of therapy use.Results: A substantial proportion of women with breast cancer were found to be using complementary therapies, with between 19.5% (most conservative estimate) and 79.9% (liberal estimate) of the women reporting the use of at least one complementary therapy following diagnosis. While the majority of therapies were used on a daily basis, a minimal amount of effort and finances was expended on complementary therapy use. Using two-way cluster analysis, two homogenous groups of complementary therapy users were identified based on level of commitment to complementary therapy use. Women with a low commitment to complementary therapy use comprised 73.9% of the sample and were more likely to be older and report less education than women with a moderate-to-high commitment to complementary therapy use.Conclusions: The use of complementary therapies by women with breast cancer warrants more precise measurement to accurately capture the types of complementary therapies used and the level of commitment to complementary therapy use. The findings of this study point to the value of the concept of commitment in identifying individuals willing to commit substantial time, energy and financial resources to complementary therapy use."
"AbstractBackground: Multiple sclerosis is considered a complex and heterogeneous disease. Approximately 85% of patients with multiple sclerosis indicate impaired gait as one of the major limitations in their daily life. Acupuncture studies found a reduction of spasticity and improvement of fatigue and imbalance in patients with multiple sclerosis, but there is a lack of studies regarding gait.Design: We designed a study of acupuncture treatment, according to the Heidelberg model of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), to investigate if acupuncture can be a useful therapeutic strategy in patients with gait impairment in multiple sclerosis of relapsing-remitting type. The sample consisted of 20 individuals with diagnosis of multiple sclerosis of relapsing-remitting type. Gait impairment was evaluated by the 25-foot walk test.Results: The results showed differences in time to walk 25 feet following true acupuncture. In contrast, there was no difference in time to walk 25 feet following sham acupuncture. When using true acupuncture, 95% of cases showed an improvement in 25-foot walk test, compared with 45% when sham acupuncture was done.Conclusions: Our study protocol provides evidence that acupuncture treatment can be an attractive option for patients with multiple sclerosis, with gait impairment."
"AbstractObjectives: The liver is often damaged by environmental toxins, poor eating habits, alcohol and over-thecounter drug use that damage and weaken the liver, leading to important public health problems such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and alcoholic liver diseases. It is cardinal to  treat liver disorders, because it affects the biochemistry of the cell directly. Damage to the liver can be prevented by including a balanced diet that includes nutrients and herbs that support a healthy liver. Premna tomentosa (PT) is one such herbal drug used widely in India for the  treatment of liver disorders, and we have already reported the hepatoprotective potential and antioxidant property of methanolic extract of PT leaves. Because injury to the liver can promote a variety of reactions with consequent effect on lipids, the present study was designed to elucidate  the hypolipidemic effect of PT extract in acetaminophen (AA)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Design and subjects: Animals were pretreated with PT extract (750 mg/kg, orally) for 15 days and then induced with hepatotoxicity by AA (640 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Results:  PT extract pretreatment significantly inhibited induced alterations in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, serum lipoproteins, and lipid-metabolizing enzymes. Conclusions: The results indicate that PT extract improves lipid metabolism and has  the potential for use in hepatic disorders."
"AbstractObjective: Investigate whether the gut feelings of one person, as measured with an electrogastrogram (EGG), respond to the emotions of a distant person.Design: In a double blind protocol, EGG activity was recorded in an individual relaxing in a heavily shielded chamber while, at a distance, a second person periodically viewed the live video image of the first person along with stimuli designed to evoke positive, negative, calming, or neutral emotions.Subjects: Twenty-six (26) pairs of healthy adult volunteers.Outcome measures: EGG maximum values recorded while the distant person was exposed to emotional stimuli were compared to similar values recorded during exposure to neutral stimuli.Results: EGG maximums were significantly larger on average when the distant person was experiencing positive (p = 0.006) and negative (p = 0.0009) emotions, as compared to neutral emotions. Nonparametric bootstrap procedures were employed to evaluate these differences, and the results survive correction for multiple analyses.Conclusions: EGG activity increases in response to the emotions of a distant person, beyond the influence of ordinary sensory interactions. Relationships commonly reported between gut feelings and intuitive hunches may share a common, poorly understood, perceptive origin."
"AbstractObjective: Several studies suggest that yoga can decrease oxidative stress. However reports are scanty regarding whether yoga training can improve the glutathione level of individual. This study is designed to appraise the role of yoga in maintaining glutathione (reduced and oxidized) levels and antioxidant status.Study design: This study was conducted on healthy male volunteers from the Indian Navy, who were divided into two groups—a yoga (n = 30) group and a control (n = 21) group. The yoga group was trained in yoga for 6 months. The yoga schedule consisted of prayers, asana, pranayama, and meditation. The control group practiced routine physical training exercise for 6 months. Blood samples were collected when the volunteers were in fasting condition before and after completion of 6-month training period. Reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione reductase activity and total antioxidant status (TAS) were estimated.Results: Reduced glutathione level increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the yoga group after completion of training. Glutathione reductase activity increased significantly in the control group (p < 0.05). TAS increased significantly (p < 0.001) in the yoga group and decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the control group.Conclusions: Regular practice of yoga can maintain or improve antioxidant level of the body. The clinical relevance is that yoga practice can be used to maintain the antioxidant defense system under stressful conditions of training as observed in the case of soldiers and athletes."
"AbstractObjectives: To determine whether electrodermal measures at Jing-Well acupuncture points, “indicator” points located at the tips of fingers and toes are associated with clinical measures in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain.Design: The design of this study was a randomized sham-controlled trial. Analyses of electrodermal measures were based on longitudinal, multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations.Subjects and setting: The subjects were 14 young women (ages 14–22) with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Subjects were randomized to sham acupuncture or Japanese-style active acupuncture. Sixteen (16) treatments were administered over 8 weeks.Outcome measures: Using a Hibiki-7 device, electrodermal impedance measures were obtained at all 24 Jing-Well points for each treatment visit. From these readings, measures of “imbalance” were determined by calculating statistical dispersion (statistical deviation and Gini coefficient) and level of asymmetry (left–right, top–bottom, and yin–yang). Clinical outcome measures were obtained at baseline, week 4, and week 8 and included level of pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, perceived stress, and inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α).Results: Participants designated to the acupuncture group had, on average, a substantial decrease in statistical dispersion and asymmetry of Hibiki-7 values over the course of treatment compared to the sham group. Electrodermal asymmetry variables, specifically either yin–yang or left–right measure, were significantly associated with pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, and Perceived Stress even after adjusting for treatment designation. No associations between electrodermal balance measures and inflammatory cytokines were found.Conclusions: Electrodermal measures may be significantly associated with clinical outcome and acupuncture treatments in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain."
"AbstractObjectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the body's          psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical reports (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can          respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a forthcoming publication (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how          the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception.Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures          were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of ""normal"" psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin          conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials (ERP) and heartbeatevoked potentials (HBEP) were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/          accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed.Results: The main findings presented here are: (1)          surprisingly, both the heart and brain appear to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) even more surprisingly, there is compelling evidence that the heart appears to receive intuitive information          before the brain; (3) there were significant differences in prestimulus ERPs for calm versus emotional stimuli; (4) the frontal cortex, temporal, occipital, and parietal areas appear to be involved in the          processing of prestimulus information; (5) there were significant differences in prestimulus calm/emotional HBEPs, primarily in the coherent mode; (6) there were significant gender differences in the processing          of prestimulus information. Especially noteworthy is the apparent interaction between the HBEPs and ERPs in the females, which suggests that the heart modulates the ERP and that females are more attuned          to intuitive information from the heart.Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that the heart and brain, together, are involved in receiving, processing, and decoding intuitive information.          On the basis of these results and those of other research, it would thus appear that intuitive perception is a system-wide process in which both the heart and brain (and possibly other bodily systems) play          a critical role. To account for the study's results, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about          ""future"" events is spectrally enfolded.

"AbstractObjective: Most health professions recognize the value of evidence-based practice (EBP), yet the uptake of EBP across most health disciplines has been suboptimal. To improve EBP uptake, it is important to first understand the many dimensions that affect EBP use. The Evidence-Based practice Attitude and utilization SurvEy (EBASE) was designed to measure the attitudes, skills, and use of EBP among practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); however, the dimensionality of the instrument is not well understood. The aim of the current research was to examine the psychometric properties of the attitudes, skills, and use subscales of EBASE.Design: This was a secondary analysis of data obtained from the administration of EBASE. Data were examined using principal components analyses and confirmatory methods. Internal consistency reliabilities of resultant subscales were also computed.Participants: 1314 U.S. chiropractors and 554 Canadian chiropractors.Results: A unidimensional structure best fit the attitudes and use subscales. Skills subscale items were best represented by subscales with a multidimensional structure. Specifically, the skills construct was best modeled with three dimensions (identification of the research question, locating research, and application of EBP). All subscales had acceptable internal consistency reliability estimates.Conclusions: The findings support the modification of the scoring guidelines for the original EBASE. These changes are likely to result in a more accurate measure of EBP attitudes, skills, and use among chiropractors, and possibly CAM providers more generally."
"AbstractObjectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether a mindfulness meditation intervention may be effective in caregivers of close relatives with dementia and to help refine the protocol for future larger trials.Design: The design was a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness meditation intervention adapted from the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy program in relation to two comparison groups: an education class based on Powerful Tools for Caregivers serving as an active control group and a respite-only group serving as a pragmatic control.Settings/location: This study was conducted at the Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.Subjects: The subjects were community-dwelling caregivers aged 45–85 years of close relatives with dementia.Interventions: The two active interventions lasted 7 weeks, and consisted of one 90-minute session per week along with at-home implementation of knowledge learned. The respite-only condition provided the same duration of respite care that was needed for the active interventions.Outcome measures: Subjects were assessed prior to randomization and again after completing classes at 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a self-rated measure of caregiver stress, the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC). Secondary outcome measures included mood, fatigue, self-efficacy, mindfulness, salivary cortisols, cytokines, and cognitive function. We also evaluated self-rated stress in the subjects' own environment, expectancy of improvement, and credibility of the interventions.Results: There were 31 caregivers randomized and 28 completers. There was a significant effect on RMBPC by group covarying for baseline RMBPC, with both active interventions showing improvement compared with the respite-only group. Most of the secondary outcome measures were not significantly affected by the interventions. There was an intervention effect on the caregiver self-efficacy measure and on cognitive measures. Although mindfulness was not impacted by the intervention, there were significant correlations between mindfulness and self-rated mood and stress scores.Conclusions: Both mindfulness and education interventions decreased the self-rated caregiver stress compared to the respite-only control."
"AbstractObjectives: Naturopathic physicians' interest in participating in pediatric observational studies or clinical trials is unknown. Complementary and alternative medicine research may need to be conducted in the settings where these therapies are commonly used to fully understand their effects. Optimally, naturopathic physicians will participate in the research of naturopathic medical practice. A survey was conducted to ascertain naturopathic physicians' interest in participating in pediatric research studies and characteristics of those most interested.Design, setting, and subjects: In July 2004, a survey designed to assess pediatric research interests and a one-dollar incentive was mailed to all Washington state–licensed naturopathic physicians with in-state mailing addresses (n = 513). A second survey and one-dollar incentive were sent to nonresponders in November 2004. Surveys were collected through January 2005.Results: From the 499 surveys delivered as addressed, 251 completed surveys were returned (50.3%). Of the 204 naturopathic physicians in current practice who completed surveys, 59 (28.9%) indicated they would not recommend or advertise an observational, open-label, or placebo-controlled trial to their pediatric patients, and 85 (41.7%) indicated they had no interest in being involved with research studies themselves. Of the 204 respondents in practice, 83 (40.7%) would recommend placebo-controlled trials to their pediatric patients, and 52 (25.5%) were willing to recruit for such a trial in the office.Conclusions: Characteristics of naturopathic physicians most interested in active pediatric research involvement included fewer years in practice, greater number of pediatric patients treated per week, and having shared office space."
"AbstractObjectives: The clinical sequelae and manifestation resulting from whiplash injury are defined as late whiplash syndrome (LWS). The objective of this study was to investigate whether a series of osteopathic treatments of patients with LWS may improve their symptoms.Design: The study was designed as a two-phase (pre–post) clinical intervention study. In phase one, the patients received no treatment for 6 weeks; in phase two, they received five test-dependent osteopathic treatments.Setting: Forty-two (42) patients (mean age 39 years) suffering from LWS due to car rear-end collisions were included.Intervention: Five (5) individualized and custom-tailored osteopathic treatments at 1-week intervals were performed.Main outcome measures: Main outcome parameters were the neck-related pain and disability (determined by the Neck Pain and Disability Scale [NPAD]) and the quality of life (assessed on the SF-36). The presence of a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was diagnosed.Results: A direct comparison between the untreated period and the treatment period revealed clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in the osteopathic treatment period for the NPAD. In the intervention phase, the NPAD dropped from 41.5 to 26.0 points, which corresponds to an improvement of 37% (95% confidence interval=11.1–19.8; p<0.0005). For the SF-36, both the physical and the mental component summary showed a significant and substantial improvement during treatment phase (p=0.009 versus p=0.02). Prior to treatment, 17 patients (43.6%) were diagnosed with a positive PTSD; this number fell to only 6 (15.4%) during observation.Conclusions: Five (5) osteopathic treatments had a beneficial effect on the physical as well as the mental aspects of LWS and lives up to its claim of being a complementary modality in the treatment regimen of this condition. Based on these preliminary findings, rigorous randomized controlled studies are warranted."
"AbstractObjective: Pain relief resulting from services delivered by doctors of chiropractic may allow patients to use lower or less frequent doses of opioids, leading to reduced risk of adverse effects. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the association between utilization of chiropractic services and the use of prescription opioid medications.Design: The authors used a retrospective cohort design to analyze health insurance claims data.Setting: The data source was the all payer claims database administered by the State of New Hampshire. The authors chose New Hampshire because health claims data were readily available for research, and in 2015, New Hampshire had the second-highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States.Subjects: The study population comprised New Hampshire residents aged 18–99 years, enrolled in a health plan, and with at least two clinical office visits within 90 days for a primary diagnosis of low-back pain. The authors excluded subjects with a diagnosis of cancer.Outcome measures: The authors measured likelihood of opioid prescription fill among recipients of services delivered by doctors of chiropractic compared with nonrecipients. They also compared the cohorts with regard to rates of prescription fills for opioids and associated charges.Results: The adjusted likelihood of filling a prescription for an opioid analgesic was 55% lower among recipients compared with nonrecipients (odds ratio 0.45; 95% confidence interval 0.40–0.47; p < 0.0001). Average charges per person for opioid prescriptions were also significantly lower among recipients.Conclusions: Among New Hampshire adults with office visits for noncancer low-back pain, the likelihood of filling a prescription for an opioid analgesic was significantly lower for recipients of services delivered by doctors of chiropractic compared with nonrecipients. The underlying cause of this correlation remains unknown, indicating the need for further investigation."
"AbstractObjective: To quantify differences in patient expectations of healthscape (e.g., interior environment) across Western medicine (WM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) paradigms.Data sources/study setting: Primary survey data comprise 469 Taiwanese consumers. National insurance coverage of both TCM and WM is an ideal setting to test for differences in healthscape expectations.Study design: Respondents report their recent experience as either exclusive users of TCM, exclusive WM, neither, or dual usage (both TCM and WM), and are randomly assigned to one of two surveys (identical except one refers to WM contexts, the other TCM) to rate the importance of 28 healthscape factors derived from previous studies.Data collection/extraction methods: Multivariate analysis of variance is used to test the research hypotheses.Principal findings: Dual users accept some differences across paradigms. In contrast, exclusive WM users apply their existing WM expectations to TCM contexts, raising the possibility of dissatisfaction and low adoption.Conclusions: A person's experience with TCM is related to acceptance of healthscape differences. Medical service providers of TCM, and by extension complementary and alternative medicine, should devise strategies to ease initial visitation by exclusive WM users. Healthscape designs need not be modeled closely on a WM standard, as dual users accept differences."
"AbstractObjectives: Multimorbidity is common, but often poorly managed, among the rapidly growing population of older adults. The existing guidelines followed by physicians frequently lead to polypharmacy and a complex treatment burden. The objective of this study was to explore what benefits are perceived by older adults with multimorbidity as a result of long-term, regular acupuncture treatment.Design: A qualitative design with inductive thematic analysis of semistructured interviews.Settings/Location: Participants were recruited from a no-cost, college-affiliated acupuncture clinic for low-income older adults in an urban, racially/ethnically diverse neighborhood in southern California.Participants: Fifteen patients aged 60 years and older suffering from at least two chronic conditions.Results: Five themes were identified: (1) mind-body effects, (2) the enhanced therapeutic alliance, (3) what they liked best, (4) the conventional healthcare system, and (5) importance of regular schedule. A notable mind-body effect, reported by a substantial number of participants, was medication reduction. Participants also cited changes in mood, energy, and well-being as important benefits. In addition, they voiced widespread dissatisfaction with conventional healthcare. Keeping up regular treatments as a way to deal with new complaints and encourage a healthier lifestyle was seen an important aspect of care at the clinic.Conclusions: This cohort of older adults with multimorbidity valued acupuncture as a way to reduce medication as well as a means to maintain physical and mental health. In addition, they developed a strong trust in the clinic's ability to support the totality of their health as individuals, which they contrasted to the specialized and impersonal approach of the conventional medical clinic."
"AbstractObjectives: Acupuncture is commonly used to treat low-back pain (LBP) and clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy. However, less is known about how the utilization of acupuncture impacts public health service utilization in the real world. This study investigates the association between acupuncture utilization for LBP and health care utilization by assessing whether patients who undergo acupuncture subsequently use fewer health care resources and whether those patients differ in their health care use from the general population with LBP.Design: This study employed the design of a two-group pre/post secondary data analysis.Setting and subjects: There were two study populations. To identify patients who received acupuncture for LBP in 2000, patient charts at Alberta registered acupuncture clinics were reviewed. The comparison group was identified from the Alberta physician claims administrative database. Acupuncture group cases were matched with four comparison cases from the general population with LBP based on gender and age.Outcome measures: Number of physician visits and physician service cost for LBP-related services for 1 year pre- and postacupuncture treatment period were calculated from the physician claims data for both study groups.Results: For the 201 cases and 804 controls, the mean age was 48 years and 54% were female. The number of physician visits for the 1-year period postacupuncture decreased 49% for the acupuncture group (p<0.01) compared to the 1-year period preacupuncture. For the comparison there was a decrease of 2% in physician visits (p=0.59) for the same time periods. Corresponding to the decrease, physician services cost declined 37% for the case group (p=0.01) and 1% for the comparison (p=0.86).Conclusions: Results suggest that patients with LBP were less likely to visit physicians for LBP after acupuncture treatment. This led to reduced health services spending on LBP."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose was to assess the prevalence and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine use for weight control.Design: A list-assisted random-digit-dialed telephone survey of adults was conducted in the fall of 2002 (n = 11,211). The focus of the study was complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, other than dietary supplements, in the previous 12 months.Settings/location: The sample of respondents was drawn from the total noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population residing in telephone-equipped locations.Subjects: The sampling procedures were designed to obtain adequate representation of Hispanic and non-Hispanic black respondents. Data from the total sample of 11,211 were weighted to achieve an estimate of the U.S. population. Analyses focused on 372 people who had used CAM within the previous 12 months.Results: Of the total, 3.3% (n = 372) had used a CAM therapy in the previous 12 months. Higher adjusted odds ratios for CAM use were found among respondents who were exercising for weight control; using a lower carbohydrate, higher protein diet; using a nonprescription weight-loss product(s); overweight; physically active; and not satisfied with one's body (adjusted for age, race, gender, education, and city size). The most often used therapies were yoga (57.4%), meditation (8.2%), acupuncture (7.7%), massage (7.5%), and Eastern martial arts (5.9%). CAM users used CAM therapies on their own (62.6%), in a group setting (26.8%) or with a CAM practitioner (10.6%).Conclusions: The use of CAM therapies other than dietary supplements for weight loss was relatively low. The most popular therapy was yoga, and the majority of CAM users used CAM therapies on their own. Persons who had used other weight loss methods had greater odds for using CAM in the previous 12 months, suggesting that CAM use is often added to other weight-loss strategies."
"AbstractObjectives: Introducing new ideas such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and evidence-based medicine (EBM) to medical students early in their education may help to nurture their interest.          This study evaluated the effectiveness of teaching CAM using EBM principles and assessed changes in student perceived knowledge, attitudes, and skills following a new curriculum on CAM.Design:          A before-and-after evaluation using a one-page, anonymous questionnaire.Setting and subjects: All third year students of a state, public medical school in Texas.Intervention: A new          curriculum comprising interactive sessions on CAM, EBM, and basic principles of epidemiology and biostatistics.Outcome measures: Changes in student-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and skills.Results: Of 67 students, complete data were obtained for 54 (81%). The majority reported that the new instruction in CAM (98%), EBM (96%), biostatistics (91%), and epidemiology (87%) would be of          some benefit in their future work. Significant changes were reported in the areas of appraising a clinical trial (p < 0.0001), critiquing the medical literature (p < 0.01), and the appropriateness          of integrating EBM and CAM in the medical school curriculum (p < 0.05). There were modest increases in the mean responses on their skill level in reading/understanding the medical literature (3.40-3.52),          comfort level in reading the medical literature (3.53-3.67), and preparedness in designing a research study (2.12-2.39) based on a five-point Likert scale, although not statistically significant.Conclusions:          Medical students could be effectively taught CAM using EBM principles. In addition, a short, interactive curriculum on an important topic has a positive impact on medical students' desires to acquire new          knowledge. This should be a good motivational message to family medicine educators regarding the contribution to new knowledge such as CAM.      "
"AbstractBackground: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is high in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), yet there are limited reports on safety and effectiveness of CAM in MS. Naturopathic medicine encompasses a broad range of CAM modalities and may improve quality of life in patients with MS.Objective: To assess quality of life in MS subjects who received interventions designed to “model” the “whole practice” of naturopathy.Design: A pilot, randomized, controlled study with a 6-month intervention period.Participants: Participants who met criteria for clinically definite MS.Interventions: The 3 intervention arms were usual care, naturopathic medicine plus usual care, and MS education plus usual care.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was quality of life (36-item short form health survey [SF-36]). Secondary outcome measures included fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale); depression (Beck Depression Inventory); cognition battery (Stroop test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 3), and neurologic impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite). Adverse event reporting and laboratory measures were used to assess safety.Results: Forty-five (45) participants (15 per group) were randomized and all completed the 6-month intervention. There were no significant differences between groups on any outcome measure. There was a trend in favoring the naturopathic group in the General Health subscale of the SF-36 (p = 0.11), Timed Walk (p = 0.11), and neurologic impairment (EDSS) (p = 0.07). There was a trend favoring the Education group in the Stroop attention test (p = 0.07). There was no difference between groups in adverse events or laboratory changes.Conclusions: Naturopathic medicine combined with usual care for MS showed a trend in improvement in the General Health subscale of the SF-36, Timed Walk, and neurologic impairment. Evaluation of naturopathic medicine, as a multimodality regimen, warrants further investigation."
"AbstractObjective: To assess the feasibility of measuring the health impacts of a 12-week naturopathic whole foods nutrition education course among adults with or at risk for prediabetes.Design: A pilot nonrandomized pre–post intervention design investigated physiological changes associated with participation in a 12-week structured naturopathic nutrition education course. Follow-up measures were assessed at 6 and 12 months from baseline.Settings/Location: Three community-based kitchens in Oregon.Subjects: Forty-five adults with or at risk for prediabetes.Intervention: Twelve weekly 90-min workshops emphasizing the health benefits of a naturopathic whole foods diet and including collective meal preparation and communal dining.Outcome measures: Changes in biomarkers of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), hemoglobin A1c, insulin, and lipids, and changes in dietary behaviors at baseline, postintervention (12 weeks), and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Changes in biomarkers and food consumption patterns were assessed using linear mixed models with random intercept, including data from all participants who completed the end-of-intervention assessment.Results: Pre–post intervention results for 45 participants showed decreases in blood glucose and hs-CRP. Food frequency questionnaire data showed decreases in daily servings of grain, dairy, and fat postintervention. Decreases in blood glucose, hs-CRP, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein, and HbA1c from baseline were observed at 12-month follow-up. Both insulin and high-density lipoprotein were decreased from baseline and 12-week levels at the 6-month follow-up but increased from all earlier levels at 12 months (all p < 0.0001). Daily servings of meat, dairy, and fat remained decreased at 6-month follow-up. Reduced grain consumption observed at 12-week and at 6-month follow-up was not sustained, and increased at 12 months, although still decreased from baseline.Conclusions: Results suggest that this naturopathic nutrition education series may promote dietary behavior change with associated changes in clinical biomarkers. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm these results."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to characterize the practice of pediatric chiropractic.Design: The study design was a cross-sectional descriptive survey.Settings/location: The settings were private practices throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.Participants: The participants were 548 chiropractors, the majority of whom are practicing in the United States, Canada, and Europe.Main outcome measures: Practitioner demographics (i.e., gender, years in practice, and chiropractic alma mater), practice characteristics (i.e., patient visits per week, practice income reimbursement), and chiropractic technique were surveyed. The practitioners were also asked to indicate common indicators for pediatric presentation, their practice activities (i.e., use of herbal remedies, exercise and rehabilitation, prayer healing, etc.), and referral patterns.Results: A majority of the responders were female with an average practice experience of 8 years. They attended an average of 133 patient visits per week, with 21% devoted to the care of children (<18 years of age). Practice income was derived primarily from out-of-pocket reimbursement with charges of an average of $127 and $42 for the first and subsequent visits, respectively. These visits were reimbursed to address common conditions of childhood (i.e., asthma, ear infections, etc.). Approach to patient care was spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) augmented with herbal remedies, exercises, rehabilitation, and so on. Wellness care also figured prominently as a motivator for chiropractic care. Fifty-eight percent (58%) indicated an established relationship with an osteopathic or medical physician. Eighty percent (80%) of the responders indicated referring patients to medical practitioners while only 29% indicated receiving a referral from a medical/osteopathic physician.Conclusions: The chiropractic care of children is a significant aspect of the practice of chiropractic. Further research is warranted to examine the safety and effectiveness of this popular nonallopathic approach to children's health."
"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, and anxiety status on subjects received a 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise program.Design: Randomized controlled          study of a Tai Chi Chuan group and a group of sedentary life controls.Setting: Taipei Medical University Hospitals and University campus in the Taipei, Taiwan, area.Subjects:          Two (2) selected groups of 76 healthy subjects with blood pressure at high-normal or stage I hypertension.Intervention: A 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise training program was practiced          regularly with a frequency of 3 times per week. Each session included 10-minute warm-up, 30-minute Tai Chi exercise, 10-minute cool-down. Exercise intensity was estimated to be approximately 64%          of maximal heart rate.Outcome measures: Blood pressure, lipid profile and anxiety status (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) were evaluated.Results: After 12-weeks of Tai Chi          training, the treatment group showed significant decrease in systolic blood pressure of 15.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 8.8 mm Hg. The serum total cholesterol level decreased 15.2 mg/dL and high-density          lipoprotein cholesterol increased 4.7 mg/dL. By using STAI evaluation, both trait anxiety and state anxiety were decreased.Conclusions: This study shows that under well-designed conditions,          Tai Chi exercise training could decrease blood pressure and results in favorable lipid profile changes and improve subjects' anxiety status. Therefore, Tai Chi could be used as an alternative          modality in treating patients with mild hypertension, with a promising economic effect.      "
"AbstractBackground: Grounding health claims in an evidence base is essential for determining safety and effectiveness. However, it is not appropriate to evaluate all healthcare claims with the same methods. “Gold standard” randomized controlled trials may skip over important qualitative and observational data about use, benefits, side effects, and preferences, issues especially salient in research on complementary and integrative health (CIH) practices. This gap has prompted a move toward studying treatments in their naturalistic settings. In the 1990s, a program initiated under the National Institutes of Health was designed to provide an outreach to CIH practices for assessing the feasibility of conducting retrospective or prospective evaluations. The Claim Assessment Profile further develops this approach, within the framework of Samueli Institute's Scientific Evaluation and Review of Claims in Health Care (SEaRCH) method.Methods/Design: The goals of a Claim Assessment Profile are to clarify the elements that constitute a practice, define key outcomes, and create an explanatory model of these impacts. The main objective is to determine readiness and capacity of a practice to engage in evaluation of effectiveness. This approach is informed by a variety of rapid assessment and stakeholder-driven methods. Site visits, structured qualitative interviews, surveys, and observational data on implementation provide descriptive data about the practice. Logic modeling defines inputs, processes, and outcome variables; Path modeling defines an analytic map to explore.Discussion: The Claim Assessment Profile is a rapid assessment of the evaluability of a healthcare practice. The method was developed for use on CIH practices but has also been applied in resilience research and may be applied beyond the healthcare sector. Findings are meant to provide sufficient data to improve decision-making for stakeholders. This method provides an important first step for moving existing promising yet untested practices into comprehensive evaluation."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to the Yoga In Daily Life® system on the self-esteem of patients with breast cancer.Design: This is a parallel-groups design.Settings/location: Baseline interventions took place at the Institute for Oncology of Ljubljana (Slovenia). At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing the instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks.Subjects: The convenience sample of 32 patients with breast cancer was recruited from an accessible population of hospitalized women. Patients were randomized to the experimental (n=16) and to the control group (n=16).Interventions: Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received a group relaxation training sessions according to the Yoga in Daily Life® system. At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks.Outcome measures: Outcome measures were obtained by blinded investigators (physiotherapists) using standardized questionnaires (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) at baseline (after the surgery); at 1 week (1 week postattendance; at discharge); and at 4 weeks (4 weeks postattendance); prior the commencement of radiation.Results: Analysis of variance showed that there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control group in all measuring self-esteem scores over the study period (p<0.0005). At the same time, the control group's scores remained unchanged over the study period (p>0.05).Conclusions: The results indicate that relaxation training according to the Yoga in Daily Life system could be a useful clinical physiotherapy intervention for patients who have breast cancer and who are experiencing low self-esteem. Although this kind of relaxation training can be applied to clinical oncology in Slovenia, more studies need to be done."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to assess health changes seen in routine homeopathic care for patients with a wide range of chronic conditions who were referred to a hospital outpatient department.Design: This was an observational study of 6544 consecutive follow-up patients during a 6-year period.Setting: Hospital outpatient unit within an acute National Health Service (NHS) Teaching Trust in the United Kingdom.Participants: Every patient attending the hospital outpatient unit for a follow-up appointment over the study period was included, commencing with their first follow-up attendance.Main outcome measure: Outcomes were based on scores on a 7-point Likert-type scale at the end of the consultation and were assessed as overall outcomes compared to the initial baseline assessments.Results: A total of 6544 consecutive follow-up patients were given outcome scores. Of the patients 70.7% (n = 4627) reported positive health changes, with 50.7% (n = 3318) recording their improvement as better (+2) or much better (+3).Conclusions: Homeopathic intervention offered positive health changes to a substantial proportion of a large cohort of patients with a wide range of chronic diseases. Additional observational research, including studies using different designs, is necessary for further research development in homeopathy."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this longitudinal outcome research study was to determine the effectiveness of the Integrative Health Clinic and Program (IHCP) and to perform a subgroup analysis investigating patient benefit. The IHCP is an innovative clinical service within the Veterans Affairs Health Care System designed for nonpharmacologic biopsychosocial management of chronic nonmalignant pain and stress-related depression, anxiety, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) utilizing complementary and alternative medicine and mind–body skills.Methods: A post-hoc quasi-experimental design was used and combined with subgroup analysis to determine who benefited the most from the program. Data were collected at intake and up to four follow-up visits over a 2-year time period. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for the statistical analysis. The outcome measures included: Health-Related Quality of Life (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Subgroup comparisons included low anxiety (BAI < 19, n = 82), low depression (BDI < 19, n = 93), and absence of PTSD (n = 102) compared to veterans with high anxiety (BAI ≥ 19, n = 77), high depression (BDI > 19, n = 67), and presence of PTSD (n = 63).Results: All of the comparison groups demonstrated an improvement in depression and anxiety scores, as well as in some SF-36 categories. The subgroups with the greatest improvement, seen at 6 months, were found in the high anxiety group (Cohen's d = 0.52), the high-depression group (Cohen's d = 0.46), and the PTSD group (Cohen's d = 0.41).Conclusions: The results suggest IHCP is an effective program, improving chronic pain and stress-related depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Of particular interest was a significant improvement in anxiety in the PTSD group. The IHCP model offers innovative treatment options that are low risk, low cost, and acceptable to patients and providers."
"AbstractObjectives: Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization and massage therapy are manual techniques that claim to increase blood flow to treated areas, yet no data on these techniques are available. This study sought to compare the effects of the Graston Technique® (GT) and massage therapy on calf blood flow, using skin temperature measures on the lower leg.Design: Single-blinded prospective, longitudinal, controlled, repeated-measures design.Setting: Research laboratory.Participants: Twenty-eight participants (mean age, 23±3 years; 14 men and 14 women; mean calf girth, 39.5±4.31 cm; calf skinfold thickness, 27.9±5.6 cm).Interventions: Each participant received 10-minute treatments (massage or GT) on two separate sessions, with the untreated leg as a control.Outcome measures: Baseline skin temperature of the calf was measured before treatment and again every 5 minutes after treatment for a total of 60 minutes. Differences between the 4 treatment conditions (GT, GT control, massage, and massage control) performed 13 times were evaluated with a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Significance was set a priori at p<0.05.Results: Significant differences with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were seen between conditions (F2.4,61.2=39.252; p<0.001; effect size [ES]=0.602) and time (F2.1,54.4=192.8; p<0.001; ES=0.881), but the main effect was not significant (F2.1,53.5=2.944; p=0.060; 1−β=0.558). The massage condition (32.05±0.16°C) yielded significantly higher skin temperatures than did massage control (30.53±0.14°C; p<0.001), GT (31.11±0.20°C; p<0.001), and GT control (30.32±0.14°C; p<0.001) conditions. Significant differences in time occurred: The temperatures at 5 minutes (30.21±0.12°C), 10 minutes (31.00±0.30°C), and 15 minutes (31.65±0.12°C) showed significant increases (p<0.001). Peak temperature was achieved at 25 minutes after treatment (31.76±0.12°C).Conclusion: Massage and GT increased skin temperature. A rise in temperature theoretically indicates an increase in blood flow to the area."
"AbstractObjective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a short-term intensive residential yoga program with physical exercise (control) on pain and spinal flexibility in subjects with chronic low-back pain (CLBP).Design: This was a wait-list, randomized controlled study.Setting: The study was conducted at a residential integrative health center in Bangalore, South India.Subjects: Eighty (80) subjects (females, n = 37) with CLBP, who consented were randomly assigned to receive yoga or physical exercise if they satisfied the selection criteria.Intervention: The intervention consisted of a 1-week intensive residential yoga program comprised of asanas (physical postures) designed for back pain, pranayamas (breathing practices), meditation, and didactic and interactive sessions on philosophical concepts of yoga. The control group practiced physical exercises under a trained physiatrist and also had didactic and interactive sessions on lifestyle change. Both of the groups were matched for time on intervention and attention.Outcome measures: Pain-related outcomes were assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and by spinal flexibility, which was assessed using goniometer at pre and post intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA).Results: Data conformed to a Gaussian distribution. There was a significant reduction in ODI scores in the yoga group compared to the control group (p = 0.01; effect size 1.264). Spinal flexibility measures improved significantly in both groups but the yoga group had greater improvement as compared to controls on spinal flexion (p = 0.008; effect size 0.146), spinal extension (p = 0.002; effect size 0.251), right lateral flexion (p = 0.059; effect size 0.006); and left lateral flexion (p = 0.006; effect size 0.171).Conclusions: Seven (7) days of a residential intensive yoga-based lifestyle program reduced pain-related disability and improved spinal flexibility in patients with CLBP better than a physical exercise regimen."
"AbstractBackground: Little is known about how prepared Chinese medicine (CM) students perceive themselves to enter the workforce.Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate perceptions of preparedness for clinical practice of final-year CM students in Australia.Design: The study design consisted of a written survey focusing on eight dimensions relating to practice: Interpersonal Skills, Confidence/Coping Skills, Professional Networks, Professional Practice Management, Professional Patient Management, Prevention, Holistic Care, and Self-Directed Learning. Part 1 of the survey required participants to choose from six possible responses on how well they believe their CM course has prepared them in relation to 41 statements about aspects of practice (1 = very inadequately through to 6 = very adequately). Part 2 consisted of nine open-ended questions.Study participants: The study participants were final-year Bachelor degree CM and acupuncture students from Australian universities and privately operated educational institutions.Analysis and main outcome measures: Part 1 of survey: mean scores on the eight dimensions of practice. Part 2 of survey: transcribed responses were imported into NVivo8. Each part of the questions was analyzed and grouped into broad themes.Results: Seventy-one (71) of one hundred and seven (71/107) invited students (average age 29.4 years ± 7.4 years) participated in the survey conducted in 2008. Mean scores on eight dimensions of clinical practice were as follows: Interpersonal Skills 3.9 (±1.1), Confidence/Coping Skills 4.0 (±0.8), Professional Networks 4.2 (±0.8), Professional Practice Management 4.2 (±0.8), Professional Patient Management 4.7 (±0.7), Prevention 4.6 (±0.7), Holistic Care 4.4 (±0.7), and Self-Directed Learning 4.6 (±0.6). There was no significant difference in mean scores across gender. Responses to Part 2 indicated a range of suggestions on the strengths of educational courses and how transition to clinical practice could be facilitated.Conclusions: In general, CM students perceived themselves to be “somewhat adequately” or “adequately” prepared for various aspects of clinical practice. Survey results may help inform CM educators about how to better prepare students for entry into the workforce."
"AbstractThe influence of complementary healing treatment on paraspinal electromagnetic activity at specific neuromuscular sites was examined in an exploratory pilot study that used a multisite surface electromyographic (sEMG) assessment procedure. The study was a replication and extension of previous research that indicated that complementary healing had a significant effect in normalizing the activity of the ""end organ"" for the central nervous system (CNS). Multisite sEMG electrodes were placed on the frontalis, cervical (C4), thoracic (T6), and lumbosacral (L3) paraspinals of 44 subjects who were divided into three groups: (1) students/patients of a Qigong practitioner (n = 16); (2) students/patients of a therapeutic touch (TT) practitioner (n = 14); and (3) nonbelievers in complementary healing (n = 14). A traditional ABAC experimental design was used with each subject evaluated for one 20-minute session that included four 5-minute segments. The purpose of this study was to measure the variable energizing effect of Qigong therapy along with the anecdotally and experimentally established relaxation effect of TT therapy relative to patient belief and expectancy. Treatment sessions consisted of Qigong and a modified form of TT intervention for all three groups. Due to the double-blind nature of the study, however, group 1 subjects were aware of only the Qigong intervention; group 2 subjects were aware of only the TT intervention, and group 3 subjects were informed that the study was designed to assess the neuromuscular activity of individuals in a seated position. The results indicated a statistically significant rise in electromagnetic activity for group 1 during the Qigong intervention segment (p < .024). Group 2 demonstrated a modest although overall nonsignificant decrease in multisite sEMG levels for both treatment protocols, whereas group 3 exhibited relatively consistent neuromuscular activity for both control and treatment segments. The results of this study are considered preliminary in nature, however, due to the potential influence of several confounds including psychophysiological factors, established behavior patterns, and the possibility for information transfer due to sensory cues."
"AbstractObjective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of weak-intensity extremely high frequency (EHF) microwaves in a model system—the plant organism pollen grain—lacking the placebo          effect, available in large populations, to ensure accurate statistical analysis, and whose sensitivity is closely relevant to animal and human biology.Design: This study was blinded using an          in vitro pollen germination technique.Subjects and study interventions: Pollen of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) was either directly irradiated or grown in a medium prepared with          irradiated water, using a CromoStim 2000,® (PromoPharma, Republic of San Marino) designed for EHF microwave resonance therapy (MRT). It produces weak intensity EHF radiations (40-78 GHz), either continuous          wave (cw) or modulated, at a 10 Hz-frequency, with infrared (IR) carried to 635-950 nm, and with an impedance (IPD) of 10-21 W/Hz cm2 and a power supply from 0 to 20 mW.Outcome          measurements: Pollen-tube emergence was expressed as a percent of grains producing a tube and tube elongation was measured at 4 hours of incubation by a turbidimetric assay (A500) of cultures,          expressed as the net absorbance increase over time 0.Results: At days 2 and 4 during aging, both percent of germination and tube growth significantly and consistently improved over controls          in kiwifruit pollen grains irradiated for 30 minutes at day 0 at 10 Hz frequency with the CromoStim 2000. Highly significant effects, either stimulant or inhibitory, were also observed on kiwifruit pollen          (stressed or not) growing in a medium prepared with water previously irradiated either cw or modulated. Irradiated water affected pollen germination immediately and even after several days following EHF          treatment.Conclusions: Either direct or indirect EHF irradiation performed by the CromoStim 2000 is effective on pollen growth processes. In both cases, water seemed to play a primary role.          According to the quantum electrodynamical coherence theory, our work could also have implications for homeopathy, suggesting a key to explain the efficacy of high dilutions and succussion procedures.

"AbstractObjectives: Ginseng saponin is known to have biological activities in maintaining homeostasis and enhancing vital energy. Enzyme-modified ginseng extract (EMGE) was designed to increase the content of its active constituents and to intensify biological activity. The present study investigated the anti-fatigue effects of EMGE in healthy adults in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Design: Fifty-two healthy subjects met the diagnostic criteria and were randomly allocated into one of two groups: EMGE (2,000 mg/day) or placebo. EMGE or placebo were administered to each group for 4 weeks. Fatigue scores using the Visual Analogue Fatigue Scale (VAFS) and Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (RPFS) were considered as the primary outcome measure. Life-quality scores were investigated using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The safety and adverse effects of EMGE were also assessed.Results: A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in the VAFS scores VAFS between the treatment and placebo groups after 4 weeks. The treatment group's score decreased more than that of the placebo group. There was no difference in the RPFS and SF-36 scores between the two groups. There were no fatal adverse effects.Conclusion: EMGE treatment for 4 weeks decreased fatigue severity in a healthy population. Adverse effects were rare, and EMGE was generally well tolerated. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of EMGE are justified in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of EMGE in combating fatigue."
"AbstractObjective: To investigate the effect of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and markers of inflammation and endothelial function in overweight and obese men.Design: Nonrandomized prospective lifestyle intervention study with pre–post design.Setting and location: Integral Health Clinic, an outpatient facility providing yoga-based lifestyle intervention programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases.Subjects: Overweight and obese men (n=51) were enrolled in the study. Subjects who were physically unable to participate and those participating in other interventions were excluded from the study.Intervention: A pretested intervention program including asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), group discussions, lectures, and individualized advice.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was weight loss, and the secondary outcome measures were clinical and laboratory correlates of CVD risk, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, and endothelin-1 (ET-1).Results: Men (n=51, body mass index [BMI] 26.26±2.42 kg/m2) were enrolled and underwent a yoga-based lifestyle intervention for 10 days. Of 51 subjects, 30 completed the study. There was a significant reduction in weight from Baseline to Day 10 (74.60±7.98, 72.69±8.37 kg, p<0.001, respectively), BMI (26.26±2.42, 25.69±2.47 kg/m2, p<0.001, respectively), and systolic BP (121.73±11.58, 116.73±9.00, p=0.042, respectively). There was a significant reduction in plasma IL-6 from Baseline to Day 10 (median 2.24 vs. 1.26 pg/mL, respectively, p=0.012). There was a significant increase in the plasma adiponectin from Baseline to Day 10 (median 4.95 vs. 6.26 μg/mL, respectively, p=0.014). Plasma ET-1 level remained unchanged.Conclusion: These findings suggest that even a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention may be an important modality to reduce the risk for CVD as indicated by weight loss, reduction in systolic blood pressure, an increase in adiponectin, and decrease in IL-6 in overweight and obese men."
"AbstractObjective:T'ai chi chuan (TCC) is a traditional Chinese exercise and is beneficial for health. Nevertheless, its effect on cardiovascular risk factors in dyslipidemic patients is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of TCC training on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in patients with dyslipidemia.Design: This was designed as a case-controlled study.Setting: The study was conducted in a community setting.Subjects: Fifty-three (53) patients (males: 24; females: 29) with dyslipidemia completed this study.Interventions: The TCC group included 28 patients who participated in a 12-month yang TCC training program. The usual-care group included 25 patients who maintained a sedentary lifestyle during this study.Outcome measures: Exercise testing was conducted at baseline and after 1 year of training. Body composition, lipid profile, fasting glucose and insulin levels, and inflammatory markers were also measured before and after training.Results: After training, the TCC group showed an increase in O2peak from 25.2 ± 4.2 to 27.4 ± 4.1 mL · kg−1 · min−1; while the usual-care group displayed a significant decrease from 25.6 ± 4.9 to 24.1 ± 4.0 mL · kg− · min−1. The TCC group also showed a reduction in blood pressure, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment index, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Conversely, the usual-care group showed no significant improvement in these cardiovascular risk factors.Conclusions: A 12-month TCC training program significantly improves aerobic capacity and CHD risk factors in patients with dyslipidemia."
"AbstractObjectives: Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) focused on the upper cervical spine is theorized to affect the function of the vagus nerve and thereby influence the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. This study was designed to determine the acute effect of upper cervical spine manipulation on cardiac autonomic control as measured by heart rate variability.Design: Nineteen healthy, young adult subjects underwent three different experimental interventions administered in random order: cervical OMT, sham manipulation, and time control. Six minutes of electrocardiographic data were collected before and after each intervention, and heart rate variability was assessed by both time-domain and frequency-domain measures.Results: No differences in resting heart rate or any measure of heart rate variability were observed between the baseline periods prior to each intervention. The OMT protocol resulted in an increase in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (0.12±0.082 seconds, p<0.01), an increase in the high frequency spectral power (p=0.03), and a decrease in the low/high frequency spectral ratio (p=0.01) relative to the sham and time control conditions. No significant differences between sham and time control were observed (p>0.11 for all variables).Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that upper cervical spine manipulation can acutely affect measures of heart rate variability in healthy individuals."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of nonthermal extremely high-frequency microwave radiations in a plant-based bioassay, represented by tobacco plants reacting to tobacco mosaic virus with a hypersensitive response leading to the appearance of necrotic lesions at the infection sites.Design: This study was performed blind and different experimental protocols on tobacco plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus were used.Bio-objects: Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cultivar Samsun) carrying the resistance gene N against tobacco mosaic virus.Interventions: Tobacco plants or leaf disks were either directly or indirectly (water-mediated) irradiated using a medical device, designed for microwave resonance therapy. It produces nonthermal weak-intensity extremely high-frequency radiations, either modulated at extremely low frequency or in continuous flux of waves, coupled with a nonthermal red/near-infrared radiation.Outcome measurements: The working variable was the number of hypersensitive lesions per leaf disk.Results: Both direct and indirect nonthermal microwave radiations led to significant effects on the hypersensitive response of tobacco plants: modulated radiations generally induced a resistance increase, whereas a continuous flux of waves induced a resistance decrease with direct treatments only.Conclusions: Nonthermal microwave radiations are effective on the hypersensitive response of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus and their low-frequency modulation seems to be more bioactive than the continuous-flux of waves, particularly in the indirect water-mediated treatments."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to describe the Norwegian population's use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) inside as well as outside of the health care system in Norway over the previous 12 months.Design: A survey based on telephone interviews has been conducted.Setting: The interviewees were sampled from the 97% of Norwegians aged 15 years or more living in private households with a landline telephone or a cell phone.Subjects: In total, 9035 individuals were called in order to include 1007 individuals in the sample.Outcome measure: The main outcome measure was the proportion receiving CAM given by a CAM practitioner over the previous 12 months. The interviews were made by trained interviewers in March 2007 by Synovate MMI for NAFKAM.Results: “Over the previous 12 months,” 48.7% of the respondents had received CAM by CAM practitioners outside of or by health care personnel inside the health care system. Approximately 18% had received CAM by providers four or more times “over the previous 12 months.” The highest proportion of female users of CAM can be found in 15–24-year-olds.Conclusions: The high use of CAM provided by CAM practitioners outside of as well as by health care providers inside the health care system indicates that users do not see themselves as belonging to one or the other system; they have already combined both systems when designing their own care."
"AbstractObjectives: The herbal compound Allergina has a long history in the clinical treatment of allergic inflammatory diseases in some countries including Korea. However, the direct effect of Allergina on ventricular contractile function has not been defined. Design: This  study was designed to investigate the impact of Allergina on ventricular contractile function. Settings: Ventricular contractile function was examined in single isolated left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Subjects/interventions: Isolated cardiomyocytes from adult male Sprague-Dawley  rats were electrically stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Outcome measures: Mechanical and intracellular Ca2+ transients properties of cardiomyocytes were evaluated using an IonOptix Myocam® (IonOptix Inc., Milton, MA) system and fura-2 fluorescent dye.  Contractile properties analyzed included peak shortening (PS), time-to-peak shortening (TPS), time-to-90% relengthening (TR90), and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (±dL/dt). Intracellular Ca2+ transients were evaluated as the fura-fluorescence intensity  change (ΔFFI) and fluorescence decay time. Results: Allergina (10-7–10-3 mg/mL) significantly augmented PS in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal response of 50.4%. Allergina did not elicit any effect on TPS, TR90, and ±dL/dt.  Intracellular Ca2+ transients displayed consistent findings in that Allergina enhanced the electrically-stimulated increase in change of intracellular Ca2+ transients (ΔFFI) and slowed intracellular Ca2+ fluorescence decay without affect the resting intracellular  Ca2+ levels. Conclusions: Collectively, these data demonstrated a direct cardiac stimulatory property of Allergina on cardiac contraction and intracellular Ca2+ transients in isolated left ventricular cardiomyocytes."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of the study was to determine (1) recruitment feasibility; (2) intervention adherence; (3) intervention acceptability; and (4) the preliminary effects of touch or foot massage interventions on anxiety during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Design: A quasi-experimental design was used.Intervention: Foot massage and touch were the intervention groups and “presence” was the control group.Setting: The study was conducted at the Center for Neurosciences, a freestanding facility, in southern Arizona.Participants: The sample (N = 60) was predominantly Caucasian (58.3%), married (55%), and college educated (43.3%). There were 39 females and 21 males. Fifty-three percent of the participants had an MRI head scan.Outcome measures: Recruitment feasibility was the percentage of participants enrolled out of those screened. Adherence to foot massage and touch interventions was measured by the researcher's ability to apply full intervention for 20 min. Four factors measured participants' acceptance of the interventions as follows: (1) comfort; (2) acceptability of the length of the treatment; (3) perception of effectiveness; and (4) recommendation of treatment as part of routine MRI care. The MRI technologists' acceptability was measured by whether the intervention: (1) disrupted the workflow and (2) affected the length of the scan. State anxiety was assessed verbally by a single 10-point Likert type item.Results: Recruitment feasibility was 78.2%. There were no barriers to the intervention protocol for 91.6% participants. The overall mean value of perceived effectiveness was 8.53, SD = 2.4 on a 10-point Likert type question. There was a significant difference among the three groups in terms of perceived effectiveness of the intervention F(2, 57) = 15.19, p < 0.001. Multilevel modeling documented that the foot massage intervention was a significant predictor of decreasing anxiety (β = −1.35, SE = 0.63, p < 0.01).Conclusion: The use of foot massage or touch is feasible, acceptable by patients and technologists, and the use of foot massage was associated with lower state anxiety."
"AbstractObjectives and background: The objective of this study was to evaluate treatment details and possible effects of an individualized homeopathic treatment in patients with migraine in usual care.Design: This was a prospective multicenter observational study. Consecutive patients beginning homeopathic treatment in primary care practices were evaluated over 2 years using standardized questionnaires. The data recorded included diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) and current complaints, including their severity (numeric rating scale = 0–10), health-related quality of life (QoL, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey), medical history, consultations, homeopathic and conventional treatments, as well as other health service use.Results: Two hundred and twelve (212) adults (89.2% women), mean age 39.4 ± 10.7 years were treated by 67 physicians. Patients had suffered from migraine for a period of 15.2 ± 10.9 years. Most patients (90.0%) were conventionally pretreated. The physician workload included taking the initial patient history (120 ± 45 minutes), case analysis (40 ± 47 minutes), and follow-ups (7.3 ± 7.0, totaling 165.6 ± 118.8 minutes). Patients received 6.2 ± 4.6 homeopathic prescriptions. Migraine severity showed marked improvement with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.48 after 3 months and 2.28 after 24 months. QoL improved accordingly (Mental Component Score and Physical Component Score after 24 months: 0.42 and 0.45). The use of conventional treatment and health services decreased markedly.Conclusions: In this observational study, patients seeking homeopathic treatment for migraine showed relevant improvements that persisted for the observed 24 month period. Due to the design of this study, however, it does not answer the question as to whether the effects are treatment specific or not."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to identify and describe ways that a spiritually based intervention of silently repeating a mantram—sacred word or phrase—was used as a coping strategy for managing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.Design: The design was a qualitative research method, the critical incident technique.Settings/location: The study was conducted at an academically affiliated Veterans Affairs Hospital in southern California.Subjects: The subjects were outpatient adults living with HIV (n=32) who were receiving care through HIV clinics, community agencies, and HIV providers.Interventions: Subjects who participated in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of a 5-weekly group mantram intervention were interviewed 2 months postintervention. Follow-up telephone interviews were specifically aimed at identifying instances of mantram use, and also participant perceptions of intervention usefulness or nonusefulness.Outcome measures: The outcome measures comprised categorization and comparison of the types and frequency of incidents reported, describing ways that the intervention was “helpful” or “not helpful” in managing stressors of HIV disease.Results: Participants reported a total of 185 incidents. Analysis and classification of the incidents resulted in eight mutually exclusive categories, including Increasing calm and/or peace, Mastering the technique, Changing my viewpoint, Increasing personal awareness, Adjusting behaviors, Managing physical symptoms, Increasing spirituality, and Enhancing relationships.Conclusions: This study shows support for the benefits of the mantram intervention for adults with HIV. Additionally, the spiritually based mantram repetition intervention was found to be more helpful in providing a convenient, portable tool for managing a wide range of situations related to living with HIV disease."
"AbstractObjectives: Reflexology claims that the feet are representative of the body and that massage to specific points of the feet increases blood supply to “mapped” organs in the body. This review provides the first systematic evaluation of existing reflexology randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether there is any evidence to suggest the existence of a reflexology treatment–related hemodynamic effect; to examine whether reflexology researchers used study designs that systematically controlled for nonspecific effects in order to isolate this specific component; and to highlight some of the methodological challenges that need to be overcome to demonstrate specific and beneficial hemodynamic effects.Design: Fifty-two RCTs of reflexology published from 1990 to September 2011 were initially retrieved.Setting/Location: Cardiorespiratory Department, Highland Heartbeat Centre, Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.Subjects: Adult subjects.Interventions: Studies using reflexology foot massage techniques as the intervention versus sham reflexology treatment, simple foot massage, conventional treatment, or no treatment as the control were then selected.Outcome measures: Outcome measures included any hemodynamic parameter potentially involved in the regulation of circulating blood volume and flow, including heart rate and systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure.Results: Seven RCTs suggested that reflexology has an effect on selected cardiovascular parameters; however, five of these delivered the reflexology intervention as a whole complex treatment, with the data collector often delivering the intervention themselves.Conclusions: This systematic review found that although reflexology has been shown to have an effect on selected hemodynamic variables, the lack of methodological control for nonspecific general massage effects means that there is little convincing evidence at this time to suggest the existence of a specific treatment-related hemodynamic effect. Furthermore, the review found that few studies of reflexology controlled for nonspecific effects in order to isolate any specific active component, despite the hemodynamic claim being a key part of the therapeutic value of reflexology. Therefore, further research approaches using more innovative designs and robust methods that can allow a treatment-induced, therapeutically beneficial hemodynamic effect to reveal itself are needed to help reflexology purchasers make a more informed decision about the safety and product quality of the reflexology hemodynamic claim and for reflexologists to be able to guarantee minimum product quality, validity, and safety standards in their practice."
"AbstractObjective: To explore how contraindications to the use of acupuncture during pregnancy are managed in clinical practice.Design: Acupuncturists' views on their management of threatened miscarriage were sought by using a mixed-methods design involving a self-completed questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. An online survey was distributed through the Australian and New Zealand acupuncture associations requesting practitioners' to access an online link to a questionnaire hosted by Survey Monkey. This questionnaire examined acupuncturist's views on safety and the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment modalities. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to analyze data. Thirteen participants were purposefully selected from the survey responses to further explore treatment management. These interviews were recorded via Skype, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis.Results: Of 370 respondents, 214 (58%) had treated women for threatened miscarriage within the previous year. Approximately half (58%) had treated four or fewer women, while a minority (14%) had treated 15 or more. The use of abdominal and blood invigorating points reflected diverse treatment strategies within acupuncture textbooks. While the majority avoided acupuncture points traditionally cautioned against in pregnancy, 13% would use LI 4, 22% would use SP 6, and 31% would use BL 32. Two safety themes emerged: “Well I'm safe because…justifying diverse approaches” and “A limited knowledge base—sorting it out for yourself,” illustrating how practitioners justified safe practice and had difficulty obtaining trustworthy treatment knowledge.Conclusion: Practitioners demonstrated interest in treating threatened miscarriage. All practitioners saw themselves as providing safe treatment. Those using historically contraindicated points justified their use on the basis of personal opinion, advice from trusted others, and clinical experience with a small number of women. In treating at-risk pregnancies, these justifications may be inadequate. Further research exploring the views of practitioners who are experienced in this specialized area would inform clinical practice for this common complication of early pregnancy."
"AbstractBackground: Despite the meridian system being an important concept in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), modern biology and Western medical systems have failed to find an anatomic substrate. Since          the 1960s, a variety of phenomena along meridians have been reported, among which quite a few suggest that along meridians there is a fluid pathway (but not blood vessels or lymphatics). On the other hand,          perivascular space (PVS) has been demonstrated to be a body fluid pathway in addition to blood vessels and lymphatics in some mammalian tissues, such as brain, thymus, and lung.Objectives: The          present study was designed to examine the relationship between PVS and the meridian. We studied characteristics of the tissues around the blood vessels along the Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming and the          Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-shaoyang, with the goal of identifying anatomical structure corresponding to the meridian described in TCM.Design and results: Through perivascular dye injection          and frozen section histology, we found that there is PVS around the blood vessels along the meridians, and it is a fluid pathway. Subsequent physiologic studies revealed that the PVS shows significantly          greater electrical conductivity and significantly higher partial oxygen pressure (pO2) compared to medial and lateral tissues.Conclusions: The PVS along the meridians has properties          offering good explanation for the meridian phenomena. The work sheds new light on the studies of meridians and may contribute to research on the mechanism of Chinese acupuncture.      "
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of transmitting the “ampicillin” growth inhibitory property to pure sterile water.Design: Three control groups were designed as references of bacterial maximal growth (MG). Different concentrations of ampicillin and pure sterile water used as “positive” and “negative” controls, respectively, and the bacterial cultures supplemented with water that merely exposed to the background carrier waves were set as “sham control.”Settings: The electronic characteristic of the ampicillin solution relayed to the water and then it was added to the bacterial culture medium. By this treatment, water received both the carrier wave and ampicillin electronic properties at 1–105 Hz range.Results: When the MG of the “treated water” and “positive control” dilutions is getting normalized against either sham or negative control, the treated water competently imitates ampicillin in a way that there is no significant difference with the positive control. These results will be affected to some extent by the time of electronic transmission and the inoculation concentration of bacterial culture. Comparison of electromagnetic signal patterns of “treated water” with the “positive control” shows that they are more similar to each other rather than negative control.Conclusion: It is believed that the extremely low frequencies can facilitate electronic transmission of ampicillin supramolecular chemistry into water. Imprinting such a property in water could be the result of durable structural configuration in treated water."
"AbstractObjectives: Current treatment strategies for painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) include oral medications, which are costly and may have adverse effects. Topical therapies have been used for PDN with some benefit. Nutmeg has certain properties that may be effective in ameliorating neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether topical nutmeg extracts can reduce pain or improve the quality of life in PDN sufferers.Design: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Settings/location: It was conducted at a primary care center in Trinidad, Caribbean.Subjects: Seventy-four (74) diabetic subjects who met criteria for painful neuropathy were recruited.Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive either topical nutmeg extracts (NEMM; mace oil [2%], nutmeg oil [14%], methyl salicylate [6%], menthol [6%], and coconut oil) or placebo (MM; methyl salicylate [6%], menthol [6%], coconut oil, and alcohol).Outcome measures: Outcome measures of pain and quality of life were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Painful Neuropathy and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory.Results: An intention-to-treat analysis was done for 24 male and 50 female subjects (30–85 years) with an average duration of diabetes of 11 years. Significant reductions in worst and average pain scores were seen within each group (p≤0.001). Similarly significant reductions were also noted for interference with walking, sleep, and mood scores as well as burning, pins and needles, and tingling scores within each group (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between both groups after 4 weeks for any outcome measure.Conclusions: In this trial topical, nutmeg extracts did not add to the improvements observed in PDN symptoms during 4 weeks treatment with preparations containing menthol and methyl salicylate. Further research designed to test the individual components of the topical therapies used in this study may clarify their benefit."
"AbstractIn this review, controlled clinical trials of acupuncture are placed into five categories on the basis of the treatment with which acupuncture is compared. Methodological and ethical issues relevant to each category are discussed. Wait list (or no treatment) controls, which are ethically acceptable for stable, chronic conditions, assess the efficacy of acupuncture relative to the natural history of the condition but do not control for nonspecific treatment effects. Placebo controls, defined here as noninvasive procedures such as inactive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or mock needling, assess whether acupuncture has an effect beyond that of the therapeutic milieu. Sham controls, defined as invasive but inappropriate procedures such as shallow needling at nonacupoint sites, assess whether acupuncture efficacy depends on the style and location of needling. Standard care comparisons assess whether acupuncture performs at least as well as a medication, medical device, or physiotherapy. Adjunctive care comparisons assess the efficacy of acupuncture plus standard care relative to standard care alone. From an ethical perspective, active debate surrounds placebo and sham controls. Those who argue against these procedures consider withholding treatment to be improper. They favor the wait list and both standard care designs in which all patients receive treatment. Others argue that testing a treatment prior to demonstrating its efficacy against a placebo is equally improper. From a methodological perspective, it should also be considered that most clinical trials of acupuncture have assessed its efficacy by administering a fixed course of treatment based on biomedical diagnosis. The challenge for future trials is to design conditions that more closely mimic the delivery of acupuncture in clinical practice, as individualized treatment informed by its own diagnostic traditions.

AbstractThe field of radiology can play a crucial role in the movement beyond allopathic and complementary medicine to a true combination approach. Radiologists are proponents of minimal invasiveness and are familiar with the overreliance on diagnostic imaging tests. Their experience can be used to design appropriate applications for technology and to plan research methods to explore the questions raised by a combination medicine paradigm.
"AbstractObjective: To investigate the effects of dextrose prolotherapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).Design: A prospective, randomized-controlled interventional trial.Setting: An outpatient pain medicine clinic.Participants: The study included 66 patients aged 40–70 years with chronic knee pain refractory to conservative therapy and diagnosed as Grade II or III KOA according to the Kellgren–Lawrence classification. The patients were assigned to the dextrose prolotherapy group (PG; n = 22), saline group (SG; n = 22), or control group (CG; n = 22).Interventions: The intra- and extra-articular dextrose prolotherapy and saline injections were administered to the PG and SG, respectively, at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. The patients were blinded to their injection group status. A home-based exercise program was prescribed for all patients in three groups.Outcome measures: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, activity pain, stiffness severity measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) subscales were recorded at the baseline at the baseline, 6-week, and 18-week follow-ups.Results: The WOMAC-pain and VAS-activity pain scores decreased significantly in the PG compared to the SG (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) and CG (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) at 18 weeks. The WOMAC-stiffness scores decreased in the PG compared to the CG at 18 weeks (p < 0.001). The WOMAC physical functioning scores were improved in the PG compared to the CG at 18 weeks (p < 0.001). The physical component scores of the HRQoL were significantly improved in the PG compared to the CG at 18 weeks (p = 0.016), but the mental component scores of the HRQoL showed no significant differences.Conclusions: These findings suggest that dextrose prolotherapy is effective at reducing pain and improving the functional status and quality of life of patients with KOA."
"AbstractObjectives: Recently it was reported that the loose connective tissue in the subcutaneous layer rapidly responded to mechanical forces evoked by acupuncture, massage, and normal physical movements. However, there were no clinical studies to substantiate these findings so far. Fu's Subcutaneous Needling (FSN) is the innovative needling strategy acting specifically in the subcutaneous layer. A single-blinded and randomized trial was designed to compare the immediate effects of FSN with different needling directions on myofascial trigger points (MTrP) in the neck.Design: For simplicity, we chose two mutually perpendicular needle directions in this study. In one group, the needle was along the local muscle fibers and pointed to the MTrP (Along Group). In the other group, the needle was across the local muscle fibers and also pointed to the MTrP (Across Group).Subjects: Forty-seven (47) patients were randomly divided into two groups: the Along Group (n = 22) and the Across Group (n = 25). There were no significant differences with respect to age, duration of pain, and gender between the two groups.Interventions: FSN needles were inserted and swayed in the subcutaneous layer 200 times in 2 minutes.Results: Before and after FSN treatment, patients were subjected to the assessment of the following three parameters: motion-related pain, pain under pressure, and the range of cervical movement. Three parameters were all reduced after the FSN intervention. There were no significant differences in variation of the three parameters between the two groups.Conclusion: Immediate effects of FSN on alleviating MTrP in the neck were not relevant to the needling directions."
"AbstractBackground: The diagnostic framework and clinical reasoning process in Chinese medicine emphasizes the contextual and qualitative nature of a patient's illness. Chinese medicine assessment data may help interpret clinical outcomes.Objectives: As part of a study aimed at assessing the validity and improving the inter-rater reliability of the Chinese diagnostic process, a structured assessment instrument was developed for use in clinical trials of acupuncture and other Chinese medical therapies.Study design: To foster collaboration and maximize resources and information, an interdisciplinary advisory team was assembled. Under the guidance of two group process facilitators, and in order to establish whether the assessment instrument was consistent with accepted Chinese medicine diagnostic categories (face validity) and included the full range of each concept's meaning (content validity), a panel of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) expert clinicians was convened and their responses were organized using the Delphi process, an iterative, anonymous, idea-generating and consensus-building process. An aggregate rating measure was obtained by taking the mean of mean ratings for each question across all 10 experts.Results: Over three rounds, the overall rating increased from 7.4 (SD = 1.3) in Round 1 to 9.1 (SD = 0.5) in Round 3. The level of agreement among clinicians was measured by a decrease in SD.Conclusions: The final instrument TEAMSI-TCM (Traditional East Asian Medicine Structured Interview, TCM version) uses the pattern differentiation model characteristic of TCM. This modular, dynamic version was specifically designed to assess women, with a focus on gynecologic conditions; with modifications it can be adapted for use with other populations and conditions. TEAMSI-TCM is a prescriptive instrument that guides clinicians to use the proper indicators, combine them in a systematic manner, and generate conclusions. In conjunction with treatment manualization and training it may serve to increase inter-rater reliability and inter-trial reproducibility in Chinese medicine clinical trials. Testing of the validity and reliability of this instrument currently is underway."
"AbstractObjectives: To test whether electrical skin impedance at each of three acupuncture points (APs) is significantly lower than at nearby sites on the meridian (MP) and off the meridian (NP).Design: Two instruments—Prognos (MedPrevent GmbH, Waldershof, Germany), a constant-current (DC) device, and PT Probe (designed for this study), a 100-Hz sinusoidal-current (AC) device—were used to record electrical impedance at three APs (right Gallbladder 14, right Pericardium 8, and left Triple Energizer 1), and two control sites for each AP. Each AP, MP, and NP was measured four times in random order with each device.Setting: The study was conducted over a period of 4 days at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM).Subjects: Twenty (20) healthy adults (14 women and 6 men), all recruited from the OCOM student body and faculty, participated in the study.Results: The Prognos measurements had an intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.84 and coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.43. The PT Probe had ICC = 0.81 and CV = 0.31. Impedance values at APs were not significantly less than at MPs or NPs. Impedance values at MPs were also not significantly less than NPs, although their individual p values were <0.05 in 4 of 6 cases. There was a significant trend of increasing impedance with repeated measurements with both the Prognos (p =0.003) and the PT Probe (p= 0.003).Conclusions: Within the reliability limits of our study methods, none of the three APs tested has lower skin impedance than at either of the nearby control points. These results are not consistent with previous studies that detected lower skin impedance at APs than nearby sites. Further study is necessary to determine whether MPs have lower skin impedance than nearby NPs. Our study suggests caution is warranted when developing, using, and interpreting results from electrodermal screening devices. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinically important and controversial hypothesis that APs are sites of lower impedance."
"AbstractObjectives: The study objective was to determine the quantitative electroencephalographic correlates of meditation, as well as the effects of hindering (15 Hz) and facilitative (7 Hz) binaural beats on the meditative process.Design: The study was a mixed design, with experience of the subject as the primary between-subject measure and power of the six classic frequency bands (δ, θ, low α, high α, β, γ), neocortical lobe (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital), hemisphere (left, right), and condition (meditation only, meditation with 7-Hz beats, meditation with 15-Hz beats) as the within-subject measures.Location: The study was conducted at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.Subjects: The subjects comprised novice (mean of 8 months experience) and experienced (mean of 18 years experience) meditators recruited from local meditation groups.Intervention: Experimental manipulation included application of hindering and facilitative binaural beats to the meditative process.Results: Experienced meditators displayed increased left temporal lobe δ power when the facilitative binaural beats were applied, whereas the effect was not observed for the novice subjects in this condition. When the hindering binaural beats were introduced, the novice subjects consistently displayed more γ power than the experienced subjects over the course of their meditation, relative to baseline.Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, novice meditators were not able to maintain certain levels of θ power in the occipital regions when hindering binaural beats were presented, whereas when the facilitative binaural beats were presented, the experienced meditators displayed increased θ power in the left temporal lobe. These results suggest that the experienced meditators have developed techniques over the course of their meditation practice to counter hindering environmental stimuli, whereas the novice meditators have not yet developed those techniques."
"AbstractObjectives: The aims of this study were to measure the potential impact of a therapeutic dog ownership and training program for Veterans with symptoms of post-traumatic stress.Design: The study used a quasi-experimental design with two cohorts of Veterans—a dog owner-trainer intervention and a wait list control group. Participants completed baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments.Setting: Clear Path for Veterans, a nonclinical, open recreation facility whose mission is to support Veterans and their families in the reintegration process after military service.Subjects: Participants (n = 48) were either enrolled in the veterans therapeutic dog owner-trainer program (Dogs2Vets) or were placed in the wait list control group.Intervention: Veterans were enrolled in the Dogs2Vets program, a 12-month structured dog owner-trainer program that engages veterans in the training and care of a dog that they ultimately adopt. The Dogs2Vets Program focuses on the healing aspects of the human-animal bond.Outcome measures: PTSD Checklist, Military Version (PCL-M), perceived stress scale, self-compassion scale (SCS) composite, and SCS subscales for isolation and self-judgment.Results: Veterans participating in the Dogs2Vets owner-trainer program experienced significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress, perceived stress, isolation, and self-judgment accompanied by significant increases in self-compassion. In contrast there were no significant improvements in these measures among veterans in the wait list control group. Qualitative data reinforced the statistical findings with themes of decreased isolation, unconditional acceptance and companionship, and a renewed sense of safety and purpose from their relationships with their dogs.Conclusion: Veterans benefit significantly from dog ownership in combination with a structured dog training program. Not only do they experience significant decreases in stress and post-traumatic stress symptoms but also they experience less isolation and self-judgment while also experiencing significant improvements in self-compassion."
"AbstractObjectives: Existing studies on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) have produced diverse results regarding the types and prevalence of CAM use due, in part, to variations in the measurement of CAM modalities. A questionnaire that can be adapted for use in a variety of populations will improve CAM utilization measurement. The purposes of this article are to (1) articulate the need for such a common questionnaire; (2) describe the process of questionnaire development; (3) present a model questionnaire with core questions; and (4) suggest standard techniques for adapting the questionnaire to different languages and populations.Methods: An international workshop sponsored by the National Research Center in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NAFKAM) of the University of Tromsø, Norway, brought CAM researchers and practitioners together to design an international CAM questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). Existing questionnaires were critiqued, and working groups drafted content for a new questionnaire. A smaller working group completed, tested, and revised this self-administered questionnaire.Results: The questionnaire that was developed contains four sections concerned with visits to health care providers, complementary treatments received from physicians, use of herbal medicine and dietary supplements, and self-help practices. A priori–specified practitioners, therapies, supplements, and practices are included, as well as places for researcher-specified and respondent-specified additions. Core questions are designed to elicit frequency of use, purpose (treatment of acute or chronic conditions, and health maintenance), and satisfaction. A penultimate version underwent pretesting with “think-aloud” techniques to identify problems related to meaning and format. The final questionnaire is presented, with suggestions for testing and translating.Conclusions: Once validated in English and non-English speaking populations, the I-CAM-Q will provide an opportunity for researchers to gather comparable data in studies conducted in different populations. Such data will increase knowledge about the epidemiology of CAM use and provide the foundation for evidence-based comparisons at an international level."
"AbstractObjectives: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a stressful disease, and depression is the most common form of psychologic distress experienced by those infected. The aim of this study was to further develop and validate a mind–body intervention to improve coping self-efficacy strategies and increase mental health.Design: Feasibility study, a randomized trial. Participants were assigned into two blocks (female/male) and simple randomization in a 1:1 ratio was performed within each block to one of two arms (1) intervention group, (2) control group who received usual care.Setting/Location and Subjects: The authors enrolled 30 HIV-infected individuals (10 women and 20 men) who had psychologic challenges and were motivated for working with personal development at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.Intervention: The intervention was a group intervention facilitated by an educated coach. The framework was a 3-day residential course plus two single-day/8-h follow-up events. The intervention was based primarily on a Native American philosophy of life and its understanding of how changes affect human beings and create imbalance.Outcome measures: Primary outcomes were change in risk of depression and level of coping self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes were change in levels of stress and personal growth.Results: Significant improvement between the intervention group and control group was seen in risk of depression and personal growth mean values from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Significant improvements were shown within the intervention group in mean values of risk of depression, coping self-efficacy, stress, and personal growth. There were no significant improvements within the control group.Conclusions: The authors suggest that interventions designed to increase resilience through enhancing coping self-efficacy be used in conjunction with HIV medication to make this approach and especially the “whole-person” commitment a fully integrated aspect of HIV care."
"AbstractObjective: To inform the potential revision of Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA), we sought the opinion of acupuncture trial authors and systematic reviewers to rank the utility of the guidelines and asked trial authors about their experiences using them.Design: Questionnaires ranking STRICTA items and qualitative responses about experience using the guidelines.Sample: The authors of 38 randomized controlled acupuncture trials randomly selected from a systematic search of those published in 2004 and 2005 were contacted with a questionnaire. Authors of 14 Cochrane acupuncture systematic reviews or protocols published in the same time frame were also sent a questionnaire.Results: Fifty-four percent (54%) (28/52) of the sample responded. Among the trial authors, 58% (11/19) used STRICTA to help guide their writing, but more than half of these reported that the editing process had removed some or all of the STRICTA-specific items. STRICTA was seen as a helpful reference, but authors requested that some items be clarified. Respondents tended to rank the utility of STRICTA highly overall, but five items in particular were not highly valued; three of these pertained to details on the trial acupuncturists' background. Authors flagged potential difficulties of reporting unusual trial designs in the current format of STRICTA.Conclusions: Authors of acupuncture trials and systematic reviews believe that STRICTA contributes to the reporting of acupuncture interventions and rate it highly. Because very few acupuncture studies are published in STRICTA-adopting journals, the editing process for journals unaware of the guidelines may be responsible for deleting acupuncture intervention-specific items. Several items remain unclear, and the relevance of STRICTA to some trial designs is questioned. A review of STRICTA is warranted to clarify and reconsider items, and targeted promotion to non–complementary and alternative medicine journals should be considered."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a specially designed, static magnet of 2700 gauss, attached over the pelvic area, could relieve menstrual pain.Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, postal questionnaire study.Setting: The study was conducted in a primary care, single center.Participants: Sixty-five (65) women (mean age 29.1 ± 1.52 years) were recruited from an advertisement in a London newspaper. The entry criterion was regular dysmenorrhea. The exclusion criterion was known secondary dysmenorrhea. Of the 65 women who were enrolled, 35 completed the study.Interventions: A questionnaire-based assessment was completed by each subject and checked by telephone before and after random allocation to use of either the static magnet device (2700 gauss) or an identical, weaker magnetic placebo device (140 gauss). Assessment was made by telephone before and after a complete menstrual cycle. None of the participants was examined or seen face-to-face.Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were level of pain, using the McGill Pain and Visual Analogue Scales, and ratings of associated symptoms such as irritability, restriction of usual activities, and painkiller consumption.Results: There was a significant reduction (p < 0.02) in pain in the magnet group compared to the placebo group. Pain score differences (McGill pain score before – pain score after use of device) were –17 (–53, 13) (median and interquartile ranges) in the magnet group and –5.0 (–29, 27) in the placebo group. The 95% Mann-Whitney confidence intervals for the median difference between the magnet and placebo groups (magnet – placebo) were –53.0 to 23.38. A reduction in irritability symptoms in the magnet group approached statistical significance (p = 0.056).Conclusions: Despite the small number of participants, the level of significance reached in the reduction of pain merits reporting. This is a pilot study to a much larger study of the same device as an analgesic in women with primary dysmenorrhea."
"AbstractBackground: Chinese medicine distinguishes itself from Western medicine in the differentiation of diseases according to underlying patterns of disharmony, or Chinese medicine (CM) syndromes. CM has its own clinical endpoints that are used as evidence of change in the body. Yet, relatively little is known about the reliability of CM diagnostic techniques, the final diagnosis of a CM syndrome, or the organizing principles used to reach a CM diagnosis such as the Eight Guiding Principles. Information about reliability of CM diagnosis has important implications for clinical practice and research, particularly if CM diagnostic variables or CM syndromes are to be incorporated into study designs.Design: An inter-rater reliability study was conducted with three CM practitioners to investigate the reproducibility of CM diagnosis according to the Eight Guiding Principles and Zang-Fu Theory. Forty-five (45) adults with mild hypercholesterolemia but who were otherwise healthy participated in the study.Results: Our results suggest that there is a reasonably good level of agreement between at least two practitioners on the dimensions of the Eight Guiding Principles. Level of agreement between at least two practitioners on CM syndrome diagnosis according to Zang-Fu Theory was very good for one syndrome only, that of Spleen qi deficiency.Conclusions: Further investigations are needed into the reliability of the CM diagnostic processes from the initial stage of data collection to the final CM syndrome diagnosis."
"AbstractContext: Numerous studies conducted in juvenile correctional institutions have reported that violence and serious antisocial behavior have been cut almost in half after implementing nutrient- dense diets that are consistent with the World Health Organization's guidelines for fats, sugar, starches, and protein ratios. Two controlled trials tested whether the cause of the behavioral improvements was psychologicical or biologicical in nature by comparing the behavior of offenders who either received placebos or vitamin-mineral supplements designed to provide the micronutrient equivalent of a well-balanced diet. These randomized trials reported that institutionalized offenders, aged 13 to 17 years or 18 to 26 years, when given active tablets produced about 40% less violent and other antisocial behavior than the placebo controls. However, generalization could not be made to typical schoolchildren without a controlled trial examining violence and antisocial behavior in public schools.Objectives: To determine if schoolchildren, aged 6 to 12 years, who are given low dose vitamin- mineral tablets will produce significantly less violence and antisocial behavior in school than classmates who are given placebos.Design: A stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with pretest and posttest measures of antisocial behavior on school property. Settings and Subjects: Two ""working class,"" primarily Hispanic elementary schools in Phoenix, Arizona. Approximately half of the potential schoolchildren participated, i.e., 468 students aged 6 to 12 years.Intervention: Daily vitamin-mineral supplementation at 50% of the U.S. recommended daily allowance (RDA) for 4 months versus placebo. The supplement was designed to raise vitamin- mineral intake up to the levels currently recommended by the National Academy of Sciences for children aged 6 to 11 years.Outcome Measure: Violent and nonviolent delinquency as measured by official school disciplinary records.Results: Of the 468 students randomly assigned to active or placebo tablets, the 80 who were disciplined at least once between September 1st and May 1st served as the research sample. During intervention, the 40 children who received active tablets were disciplined, on average, 1 time each, a 47% lower mean rate of antisocial behavior than the 1.875 times each for the 40 children who received placebos (95% confidence interval, 29% to 65%, < 5 .020). The children who took active tablets produced lower rates of antisocial behavior in 8 types of recorded infractions: threats/fighting, vandalism, being disrespectful, disorderly conduct, defiance, obscenities, refusal to work or serve, endangering others, and nonspecified offenses.Conclusions: Poor nutritional habits in children that lead to low concentrations of water-soluble vitamins in blood, impair brain function and subsequently cause violence and other serious antisocial behavior. Correction of nutrient intake, either through a well-balanced diet or low-dose vitamin-mineral supplementation, corrects the low concentrations of vitamins in blood, improves brain function and subsequently lowers institutional violence and antisocial behavior by almost half. This paper adds to the literature by enabling previous research to be generalized from older incarcerated subjects with a history of antisocial behavior to a normal population of younger children in an educational setting."
"AbstractObjectives: Nausea and vomiting are the most frequently reported side-effects by patients who are given general anesthesia perioperatively and patients with cancer who undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy.          Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) type 3A receptor (5HT3A receptor) is known to mediate nausea and vomiting and its antagonists have been used effectively to prevent and/or reduce the incidence          and severity of nausea and vomiting. However, the adverse effects on cardiac function, such as QT interval prolongation, limit their routine use by these patients. This study was designed to elucidate the          effect of ginseng saponins on the recombinant 5HT3A receptor expressed in the xenopus oocyte.Design: After in vitro transcription of the recombinant human 5HT3A          receptor in the Xenopus laevis oocyte, we examined Panax ginseng saponins (total saponin [TS], panaxadiol saponin [PD] fraction, panaxatriol saponin [PT] fraction, and ginsenoside-Rb1 and -Rg1)          for their ability to inhibit current flow through the 5HT3A receptor using the voltage-clamp technique.Results: All saponin fractions (TS, PD, PT fraction, as well as ginsenoside-Rb1          and -Rg1) inhibited the peak current induced by the agonist 5HT on the 5HT3A receptor in a concentration-dependent, reversible, and voltage-independent manner. The PT fraction inhibited 5HT-induced          currents in 5HT3A receptor more than the PD fraction; meanwhile, there was a similar degree of inhibition between ginsenoside-Rg1 and -Rb1, the main substitutes of PT fraction and PD saponin fractions,          respectively.Conclusions: These results indicate that ginseng saponins, especially PT fraction, have substantial inhibitory effects on the recombinant 5HT3A receptor, suggesting that          some of the specific types of ginsenoside might have an antagonistic action against 5HT3A receptor related to nausea and vomiting.

"AbstractObjectives: To fulfill the general scientific method requirement for one of our earlier Minnesota experiments, namely that laboratory spaces operated by other investigators at different sites in          the United States can be conditioned to a higher electromagnetic gauge symmetry state than our normal background state and such a space can be specifically tuned so that the pH of purified water in equilibrium          with air will be increased by approximately 1.0 pH unit with no chemical additions.Design: Insertion of a specific intention imprinted electrical device (IIED) into the space for a period of          at least 3 months while continuously monitoring the pH of purified water wherein the water was replaced and the pH-electrode recalibrated on a 2-week cycle. Control sites were associated with each IIED          site.Setting/location: Offices in homes and clinics.Subjects: Three IIED sites plus three control sites.Interventions: None.Outcome measures: Continuously          recorded pH and temperature.Results: (1) Linear and exponential pH(t) variations with time at IIED sites, with the ΔpH-values increasing with each 2-week cycle up to a value of approximately          0.8-1.0 pH units, (2) control sites, 2-20 miles distant from the IIED sites exhibited similar behavior but with smaller ΔpH-values, and (3) a new information transfer mechanism in nature has been          demonstrated.Conclusions: Human consciousness, at least under some conditions, can strongly influence well-designed target experiments in physical reality and the primary data are reproducible          in other laboratories provided the specific protocol is followed.

"AbstractThe association between acupuncture (AP) and pain relief is so strong that it has tended to obscure any other potentially significant clinical results. This review indicates the wealth of data from around the world on various aspects of AP treatment for low back syndromes related to lumbar intervertebral disk prolapse (PID). Although plentiful, the research is variable in quality, especially with respect to design, consistency, and follow-up. Even so, the large number of patients who appear to have been treated successfully (i.e., given a high degree of symptomatic relief) supports a potential role for AP. This is further supported by studies on patients who had previously had unsuccessful treatment with conservative methods. The role envisaged for AP, in cases of lumbar PID and sciatica, is at least of a supplementary therapy capable of reducing the requirement of more invasive forms of treatment. No such role is envisaged in cases of cauda equina compression where surgery must remain the treatment of choice. AP should be explored more fully, using appropriate designs, so that this discipline may achieve its full therapeutic potential in the West."
"AbstractBackground: Patients in Norway and Demmark with the medical diagnoses of cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), and HIV/AIDS use complementary and alternative treatment (CAT) in growing numbers, most often in addition to receiving conventional treatment. At the same time, the interest and demand from patients for more holistic-oriented care is strongly increasing. Following this, there is a desire and need for better communication and cooperation among the conventional medical establishment, CAT practitioners, and patients. This development raises new demands on research designs to incorporate complexity and diversity concerning the intervention, effect mechanisms, and outcomes.Discussion: This article outlines different models used to combine conventional, complementary, and alternative treatment (CCAT), describing various degrees of integration among therapies. The authors are closely involved in three current and planned research projects in Norway and Denmark focusing on cancer, MS, and HIV/AIDS. These research projects are briefly introduced as examples of bridge-building efforts dealing with integrative care. Despite explicit political good will in Norway and Denmark, initiatives to enhance integration face challenges connected to lack of knowledge; resistance toward CCAT; lack of time, space, and economic resources; and patients left without any claim on insurance in the case of treatment failure. These challenges are outlined based on the researchers' experience from being involved in the research projects.Conclusions: To optimize treatment outcomes in the future, it is argued that the need for closer cooperation among conventional and alternative therapists across professional boundaries in an interactive partnership with patients is evident. Researchers have to rethink research design and methods in meeting the new trend toward bridge building based on integrative health care."
"AbstractThis presentation provides an overview of studies that are of sound methodological quality and that contribute to the understanding of acupuncture. It is difficult to design an appropriate control group          for acupuncture because acupuncture is an invasive, physical modality. No single control group can answer all of the research questions. Therefore, many types of control groups, each with advantages and          disadvantages, have been used, depending on the specific questions being asked. Examples are taken from the different categories of control groups (e.g., acupuncture versus standard medical care). A model          for future acupuncture research, which is simultaneously comprehensive and cost effective, is described.      "
"AbstractIntroduction: Economic evaluation, linking the costs and consequences of an intervention to indicate the potential benefits of alternative interventions, is becoming established as one of the core tools for decision making in health care. As knowledge of the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions increases, economic evaluation within CAM has a heightened significance.Objective: To explore whether the present framework for economic evaluation fits CAM and what modifications if any are needed for its application.Design: Systematic review.Methods: A comprehensive search of four databases was undertaken (NHS Economic Evaluation Database, AMED, MEDLINE,™ CINAHL). Studies were included if they took the form of a comparative analysis of costs and consequences of a CAM treatment and were written in English. Each study was reviewed using a set of methodological questions to judge their quality as economic evaluations.Results: A total of 19 studies were identified, of which 9 were cost-effectiveness studies, 7 cost-consequence studies, 2 cost-minimization studies, and 1 cost-benefit analysis. Seventeen (17) of the studies involved CAM treatments being used alongside mainstream or conventional treatments. The majority of the treatments aimed to alleviate pain, including chronic pain, back pain, neck pain, and migraine. Only a small minority of studies addressed wider outcomes of particular relevance to CAM disciplines. Nine (9) adopted a service provider perspective only, 7 included wider sickness absence costs and 3 patient costs. Only 1 study included costs to relatives. The quality of the cost and benefit dimensions of the studies was mixed.Conclusions: A CAM sensitive approach to economic evaluation is required. This needs to include a focus on outcomes that explore the range of effects of CAM treatment, an exploration of the client's perspective and not just that of the service provider and study designs that facilitate the individualized practitioner approach so central to CAM treatment."
"AbstractObjectives: Massage therapy is one of the most commonly used complementary therapies for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of traditional Japanese massage therapy on various symptoms of patients with PD.Design: The study design was a case series study.Setting: The study was conducted at the Center for Integrative Medicine, Tsukuba University of Technology, Japan.Subjects: The subjects were 10 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 69.6±7.7 years; range, 55–85 years) who presented for consultation with a neurologist between February and April 2009 and who desired massage therapy in conjunction with standard pharmaceutical treatment.Intervention: The intervention comprised a 30-minute session of traditional Japanese massage in conjunction with standard conventional medication.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were as follows: Gait speed in the 20-m walk test (10-m walk and return) for gait disturbance, angular range of shoulder joint motion for frozen shoulder, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessing the severity of each of various symptoms (hypophonia, shoulder stiffness, muscle pain, heaviness or lassitude of a body part, and fatigue), as determined before and after the massage session.Results: (1) Patients with gait disturbance showed improved gait speed, (2) those with frozen shoulder showed improved range of motion of the shoulder joint, and (3) VAS scores for assessing the severity of other subjective symptoms were improved.Conclusions: These results suggest that traditional Japanese massage therapy used in combination with medication is effective for alleviating various symptoms in patients with PD and may contribute to enhancing their health-related quality of life. Larger studies with a control group are required to verify these findings."
"AbstractObjective: In humans, considerable circumstantial evidence exists that indicates soluble root extracts of the American coneflower, genus Echinacea, may act to ameliorate virus-mediated afflictions, such as the common cold, influenza, and even AIDS and virus-based tumors. This study was designed to quantify, in normal mice, Echinacea-mediated, quantitative, dynamic changes, with time on both mature and precursor cells, of all the hemopoietic and immune-cell lineages in the spleen and bone marrow.Design: A specific, commercially prepared potent extract of Echinacea root was provided daily in the diet for either 1 week or 2 weeks with the aim of establishing a possible mechanism of action for this herb.Results: The data revealed that natural-killer (NK) cells and monocytes, both mediators of nonspecific immunity and well-demonstrated killers of virus-containing cells, were numerically and significantly increased in both the bone marrow and the spleen as early as 1 week after beginning treatment with the dietary herb. In contrast to our observations with NK cells and monocytes, the sizes of all other hemopoietic and immune cell populations in these two organs remained at control levels even after 2 weeks of daily dietary Echinacea.Conclusions: The work has demonstrated the specific nature of Echinacea-derived phytochemicals in acting as stimulants of those cells responsible for nonspecific immunity, as the first line of defense against virus-infected/transformed cells. The observations that these cells were elevated in the bone marrow indicates that at least one mechanism of action of this herb, is to stimulate new cell production in situ. The significant elevation of these two fundamental immune-cell populations, in normal animals, suggests a prophylactic role for this herb."
"AbstractBackground: The Research Scholars Program (RSP) was created at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM) to provide faculty development in research literacy, research-informed clinical practice, and research participation skills. The RSP is part of a broad effort, funded by a National Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine R25 education grant, to infuse an evidence-based perspective into the curriculum at schools of complementary and alternative medicine. The RSP arose from the realization that this curriculum reform would first necessitate faculty training in both research appreciation and pedagogy. OCOM's grant, Acupuncture Practitioner Research Education Enhancement, is a partnership with the Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing (OHSU SON).Design: The RSP was developed initially as a collaborative effort among the OCOM Dean of Research (R.H.), OCOM Director of Research Education (S.F.), and an OHSU SON education specialist (K.L.). The 9-month, 8 hours per month seminar-style RSP provides the opportunity for a cohort of OCOM faculty and staff to explore research-related concepts and content as well as pedagogical practices that emphasize interactive, learner-centered teaching. The RSP adheres to a competency-based approach as developed by the Education Committee of the grant. As a tangible outcome, each Research Scholar designs a sustainable learning activity that infuses a research perspective into their courses, clinic supervision, or other sphere of influence at the college. In this paper, we describe the creative process and the lessons learned during the planning and initial implementation of the RSP.Conclusions: We view the early successes of the RSP as encouraging signs that research literacy and an evidence-based perspective are becoming increasingly accepted as needed skill sets for present-day practitioners of acupuncture and Oriental medicine."
"AbstractObjectives: To explore perceptions of health and illness, and the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), among people with type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), and relate these to quality of life.Design: A self-administered survey was delivered by mail and internet. The questionnaire was designed from data generated from qualitative research and other sources, to collect information on health-status, CAM use, and health and illness perceptions. Quality of life was compared among participants using Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL-4D).Subjects: Adults with type 2 diabetes and/or CVD residing in Victoria, Australia, whether or not they used CAM therapies as well as conventional medical treatment.Outcome measures: Comparisons were made of AQoL-4D utility scores, demographic, health and wellbeing status, care-seeking and health management behaviors, and behavioral and illness perception variables. A range of descriptive statistical and predictive modeling techniques were used to assess significant associations (p<0.01) between CAM-user and non-user populations.Results: From a sample of 2766 people, 45.1% had used CAM in the past 12 months and the remainder had never used CAM; ages ranged from 20-96 years. CAM-users tended to report lower (worse) quality of life measures than non-users, and a greater number of chronic conditions in addition to diabetes and CVD. Despite this, CAM-users reported their illness perception and behavioral change more positively than non-users. There was little difference between CAM and non-users in use of prescription medications despite CAM-users greater disease burden.Conclusion: Higher CAM use and low quality of life appear to reflect comorbidity and poor general health. Greater evidence is needed of how CAM use might support chronic illness prevention and complement chronic disease management, with important policy implications concerning the integration of CAM therapies with mainstream health services."
"AbstractObjectives: Electromagnetic field therapy has been reported to be beneficial in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with significant fatigue. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effects of Bio-Electro-Magnetic-Energy-Regulation (BEMER) on MS-related fatigue.Design: This was a monocenter, patient- and rater-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.Patients: There were 37 relapsing-remitting patients with MS with significant fatigue in the study.Intervention: The intervention consisted of BEMER magnetic field treatment for 8 minutes twice daily in comparison to placebo for 12 weeks.Outcome measures: The primary outcome criterion was change in the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) between baseline and 12 weeks. The secondary outcome criteria were changes of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a general depression scale–long version (ADS-L), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Scale (MSFC), and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).Results: There was evidence of a significant difference of MFIS value (primary outcome criterion) after 12 weeks in favor of the verum group (26.84 versus 36.67; p = 0.024). In addition, FSS values were significantly lower in the verum group after 12 weeks (3.5 versus 4.7; p = 0.016). After 6 weeks' follow-up, verum and placebo groups did not differ in experienced fatigue (MFIS, FSS). Regarding the subscales of the MFIS, there was a significant decrease in physical (p = 0.018) and cognitive (p = 0.041), but not in psychologic subscales only in the verum group regarding the timepoints baseline and 12 weeks. BEMER therapy was well tolerated.Discussion: In this pilot study, we were able to demonstrate a beneficial effect of BEMER intervention on MS fatigue. As this was only a pilot study, trials with more patients and longer duration are mandatory to describe long-term effects."
"AbstractObjectives: To assess whether Interactive Guided ImagerySM (IGI) is helpful to medical patients and to identify factors that contribute to positive outcomes.Design: A prospective cohort study of 323 medical patients who received 6 IGI sessions on a weekly basis. Patients and practitioners completed questionnaires at the beginning, middle, and end of the 6 IGI sessions. The questionnaires assessed the patients' ability to do IGI, the quality of the practitioner-patient interaction, possible confounding variables, and enabling factors. The hypothesis was that measures of the process of doing IGI and the practitioner–patient relationship would predict outcomes.Subjects/setting: The subjects were all patients seeking treatment at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, and Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, CA.Intervention: Using IGI interactively is a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to help patients relax by using mental images to discover and cultivate healing intentions, and to reflect on the meaning of these images.Measures: The individual measures to assess the patients' ability to do IGI and measures of the practitioner–patient relationship were factor-analyzed to use as predictor variables in a multiple regression. Similarly, the questionnaire items measuring cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual benefits of IGI were factoranalyzed into factors representing ""insight"" and ""all other"" benefits.Results: The multiple regression shows that both process and practitioner-patient interaction factors significantly contributed to a combined 40% of the variance in patients' ratings of insight into the nature of their problem and to becoming aware of an aspect of self, F(4,56) = 9.4, p < 0.005. The same process and interaction factors were less strongly related to the other outcomes, r2 = 0.14, F(4,56) = 2.3, p = 0.06. None of the demographic, confounding, or enabling factors was related to the outcome measures.Conclusions: The process of doing IGI and the relationship with the practitioner were both independently associated with the patients' insight into their health problems."
"AbstractObjectives: Anecdotal reports suggest that changes in dog behavior might be used to predict impending migraine episodes. This survey was designed to investigate how companion dogs react to migraines that occur in their owners.Design: Online survey was available from January 4–31, 2012.Settings/location: Survey was conducted through SurveyMonkey, with links to the survey posted at Migraine.com and promoted through social media.Subjects: Adults ≥18 years old who experience migraine episodes and live with a dog were eligible to participate.Interventions and outcome measures: Participants completed an 18-question online survey that asked about participant demographics, migraines, and their dog's behavior before or during migraine episodes.Results: The survey was completed by 1029 adult migraineurs (94.9% women), with migraines typically occurring ≤8 days per month in 63.4% of participants. A recognized change in the dog's behavior prior to or during the initial phase of migraine was endorsed by 552 participants (53.7%), most commonly unusual attentiveness to the owner (39.9%). Among the 466 participants providing details about their dog's behavior with their migraines, 57.3% were able to identify dog alerting behavior before symptoms of a migraine attack would typically begin, with changes usually noticed within 2 hours before the onset of initial migraine symptoms. The dog's behavior was considered to be often or usually linked with the development of a migraine for 59.2% of migraineurs, and 35.8% of migraineurs endorsed beginning migraine treatments after the dog's behavior was recognized and before migraine symptoms had started. Participant demographics, migraine frequency, and breed of dog in the home were similar between the 470 participants with no alerting behavior endorsed and the 466 participants providing detailed alerting information.Conclusions: About one in four migraineurs living with a companion dog endorsed recognizing a change in their dog's behavior before recognizing initial symptoms of a migraine attack."
"AbstractObjective: To determine whether the effectiveness of Hatha yoga therapy is comparable to conventional therapeutic exercises (CTEs) for reducing back pain intensity and back-related dysfunction in patients with chronic nonspecific low-back pain (CNLBP).Design: The study was a prospective randomized comparative trial, divided into two phases: an initial 6-weekly supervised intervention period followed by a 6-week follow-up period.Settings: This study was conducted at Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research of a tertiary care hospital.Subjects: Patients between 18 and 55 years of age with complaint of CNLBP persisting ≥12 weeks with pain rating ≥4 on a numerical rating scale (0–10).Intervention: A total of six standardized 35-min weekly Hatha yoga sessions (yoga group) and similarly 35-min weekly sessions of CTEs (CTE group), designed for people with CNLBP unaccustomed to structured yoga or CTE program. Participants were asked to practice on nonclass days at home.Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) (0–10) and 24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ). Secondary outcomes were pain medication usage per week and a postintervention Perceived recovery (Likert seven-point scale) of back-related dysfunction. Outcomes were recorded at the baseline, 6-week follow-up, and 12-week follow-up.Results: Seventy subjects were randomized to either yoga (n = 35) or CTE group (n = 35). Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat, with last observation carried forward. Both yoga and the CTE group have shown significant improvement in back pain intensity and back-related dysfunction within both the groups at 6- and 12-week follow-ups compared to baseline. No statistically significant differences in the pain intensity (DVPRS; at 6 weeks: n = 35, difference of medians 1.0, 95% confidence interval [−5.3 to 3.0], p = 0.5; at 12 weeks: n = 35, 0.0 [−4.2 to 5.0], 0.7) and back-related dysfunction (RDQ; at 6 weeks: n = 35, 1.0 [−9.6 to 10.6], 0.4; at 12 weeks: n = 35, 0.0 [−8.8 to 10.6], 0.3) were noted between two groups. Improvements in pill consumption and perceived recovery were also comparable between the groups.Conclusion: Yoga provided similar improvement compared with CTEs, in patients with CNLBP."
"AbstractObjectives: An estimated 30%–50% of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) report persistent insomnia, which may affect daytime functioning and quality of life, and lead to longer term health complications. Although the gold standard insomnia intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), has demonstrated efficacy, accessibility is limited due to a scarcity of trained providers, and adherence to therapy is variable. Group-delivered alternative therapies may offer an opportunity to reach and treat BCSs with insomnia. This pilot study was designed to assess feasibility of a group-delivered mind–body intervention compared with group-delivered CBT-I among BCSs.Design: The authors recruited n = 25 stages I − IV BCSs to a 9-week trial of group therapy for insomnia. Eligible women were assigned to the next upcoming group until it was full. Primary outcomes were to assess intervention feasibility measured by (1) qualitative focus group feedback and (2) attendance. The feasibility of using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was also assessed in this population and ISI change scores were gathered to allow for power calculations in a future trial. Means and frequencies were used to describe participant demographics and attendance.Results: The authors found higher attendance (86% vs. 67% of sessions) and greater satisfaction with the intervention (84.6% vs. 57.1%) reported among mind–body participants than among CBT-I participants. Qualitative feedback suggested more group cohesion among the mind–body group and lower incentive to attend in-person among the CBT-I group.Conclusions: The results suggest that delivering a mind–body intervention for BCSs is feasible and acceptable, based on attendance and qualitative feedback."
"AbstractObjectives: This article describes the implementation of a group medical visit (GMV) model to increase access to integrative oncology (IO) care. The most challenging and critical time to access high-quality IO care is while patients are receiving conventional cancer therapy. Often demand for individual IO clinic consultations precludes this from occurring. A three-session GMV program was designed to alleviate barriers to receiving integrative care during active cancer treatment.Design: A consolidated framework was used for implementation research and focused ethnography methods to describe the IO GMV implementation process. Data sources included patient evaluations, participant observation, and brief provider and patient interviews.Setting: A pilot program was created to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing IO GMVs at a comprehensive cancer center.Intervention: Each three-session GMV consisted of a didactic session, followed by individual visits with the integrative oncologist.Results: The setting, intervention, and implementation process of the IO GMV program were described. Thirty-two patients participated in the first five cohorts of the program. Twenty-two were women; 24 were White. The median age of participants was 52. Patient evaluations demonstrate high levels of satisfaction with the program with all scored aspects rated >4.0 on a five-point Likert scale. For the medical center, group visits are a financially viable alternative to individual IO visits; revenue from group visits exceeded the revenue potential of 6 h of individual visits by an average of 38%.Conclusion: GMVs are a feasible and promising model for increasing access to IO. Patients in active cancer treatment were able to participate in the program. Future research and implementation efforts could examine health outcomes over time after participation in GMVs, as well as the feasibility of using this model with more diverse patient populations."
"AbstractObjective: Constipation is quite common and has impact on life quality in the elderly diabetic patients; therefore it is important to seek better treatments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Chang Run Tong (CRT) decoction on constipation in elderly diabetic patients in comparison with the effect of Macrogol 4000 powder (Forlax).Design: This study was designed as a prospective study consisting of two parallel arms: CRT group and Forlax group.Settings/Location: The study was conducted in China-Japan Hospital.Subject interventions: Eighty elderly diabetic patients with constipation were evaluated, among them 52 patients were treated with CRT and 28 patients were treated with Forlax.Outcome measures: The patients were interviewed for Bristol stool scale, spontaneous complete bowel movements (SCBM) and symptoms of defecation feeling, defecation weakness, feeling of incomplete evacuation, bloating, and flatulence at different time points. The changes of all above parameters from treatment for 2 and 4 weeks and follow-up for 1 and 2 months with reference to the baseline (before treatment) were compared between CRT and Forlax treatments. The treatment efficiency was evaluated and compared between two different treatments.Results: For the improvement of Bristol stool scale, SCBM and feeling of incomplete evacuation, CRT was significantly better than Forlax at different time points (p < 0.01, p < 0.001). For the symptoms of defecation feeling, defecation weakness, bloating, and flatulence, CRT was significantly better than Forlax for follow-up improvement (p < 0.01, p < 0.001); whereas no difference was found at other time points of the treatment (p > 0.05). Furthermore, CRT had a significantly better treatment efficiency than Forlax (p < 0.001).Conclusions: Both CRT and Forlax treatment could effectively improve bowel habits and symptoms of constipation in elderly diabetic patients. CRT was better than Forlax to treat constipation in elderly diabetic patients and had better follow-up improvement after stopping drugs."
"AbstractObjectives: To explore the recommendations of naturopathic medicine for the management of endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia, drawing on traditional and contemporary sources.Design: Content analysis.Setting: Australia, Canada, and the United States of America (USA).Subjects: Contemporary sources were identified from reviewing naturopathic higher education institutions' recommended texts, while traditional sources were identified from libraries which hold collections of naturopathic sources. Sources were included if they were published from 1800 to 2016, were in English, published in Australia, Canada, or the USA, and reported on the topic. Included sources were as follows: 37 traditional texts; 47 contemporary texts; and 83 articles from naturopathic periodicals.Results: Across included sources, the most reported disciplines were herbal medicine, clinical nutrition, mineral medicines, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and chemical-based medicines. Herbal medicines were extensively reported from all sources for the management of endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia. Clinical nutrition was only recommended from contemporary sources for all three conditions. Mineral medicines were mentioned in both traditional and contemporary sources, but were only recommended for dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. There were limited recommendations for homeopathy and hydrotherapy treatments in all conditions across all sources. Chemical-based medicines were only mentioned for dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and recommendations ceased after 1922. Recommendations for endometriosis were not present in any of the traditional sources, across all reported disciplines.Conclusions: The findings of this article provide insights into the documented historical and contemporary treatments within naturopathic medicine for endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia. While philosophical principles remain the core of naturopathic practice, the therapeutic armamentarium appears to have changed over time, and a number of the original naturopathic treatments appear to have been retained as key elements of treatment for these conditions. Such insights into naturopathic treatments will be of particular interest to clinicians providing care to women, educators designing and delivering naturopathic training, and researchers conducting clinical and health service naturopathic research."
"AbstractObjectives:T'ai chi (TC) has been found effective for improving chronic low back pain (cLBP). However, such studies did not include adults over 65 years of age. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TC in this population compared with Health Education (HE) and with Usual Care (UC).Design: Feasibility randomized controlled trial.Settings/Location: Participants were recruited from Kaiser Permanente Washington and classes took place in a Kaiser facility.Patients: Adults 65 years of age and older with cLBP.Interventions: Twenty-eight participants were randomized to 12 weeks of TC followed by a 24-week tapered TC program, 12 were assigned to a 12-week HE intervention and 17 were assigned to UC only.Outcome Measures: Feasibility and acceptability were determined by recruitment, retention and 12-, 26-, and 52-week follow-up rates, instructor adherence to protocol, class attendance, TC home practice, class satisfaction, and adverse events.Results: Fifty-seven participants were enrolled in two cohorts of 28 and 29 during two 4-month recruitment periods. Questionnaire follow-up completion rates ranged between 88% and 93%. Two major class protocol deviations were noted in TC and none in HE. Sixty-two percent of TC participants versus 50% of HE participants attended at least 70% of the classes during the 12-week initial intervention period. Weekly rates of TC home practice were high among class attendees (median of 4.2 days) at 12 weeks, with fewer people practicing at 26 and 52 weeks. By 52 weeks, 70% of TC participants reported practicing the week before, with a median of 3 days per week and 15 min/session. TC participants rated the helpfulness of their classes significantly higher than did HE participants, but the groups were similarly likely to recommend the classes.Conclusion: The TC intervention is feasible in this population, while the HE group requires modifications in delivery."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of individually designed herbal formulas according to the rules of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.Design: This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind study with two parallel groups.Settings/location: This study was conducted at the University-centre in Gars am Kamp/Austria and was organized by the Institute of TCM and Complementary Medicine of the Danube University Krems /Austria.Subjects: The study comprised female and male patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee aged between 45 and 75 years.Interventions: Patients were randomized into a treatment with individualized, water-based herbal decoctions prepared in a standardized cooking process (Verum group) or to a treatment with nonspecific presumably ineffective, water-based herbal decoctions (Control group).Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the comparison of change between the intervention groups in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities lower limb global index questionnaire (WOMAC global index) between baseline and week 20. Secondary outcomes included subscales of WOMAC for pain (A), stiffness (B), and functional impairment (C) and general quality of life in the form of the SF-36 questionnaire.Results: Altogether, 102 patients were randomized in this trial. The demographic and medical baseline characteristics were comparable in the 2 groups. The change of the WOMAC global index and all three subscales was significant in both groups between week 20 and baseline (verum group, global WOMAC: at baseline 47 [SD ± 11.8] and at week 20: 24 (SD ± 18.3); change of mean 23; p > 0.001; control group; global WOMAC: at baseline: 48 (SD ± 14.7) and at week 20: 25 (SD ± 18.3); change of mean 23; p > 0.001). However, there was no significant difference (p = 0.783) between the treatment groups. There were significant changes in the subscales “physical functioning,” “bodily pain,” “vitality,” “social-functioning,” and “role-physical” of the SF-36 in both study groups between 20 weeks and baseline, but again no significant difference between the groups. There were no drug-related serious adverse events.Conclusions: While the individual prescription consisting of medicinal herbs according to TCM diagnosis investigated in this trial tend to improve the osteoarthritis, the same effect was also achieved with the nonspecific prescription."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as an adjuvant therapy for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.Design: The design of this study was a case series.Location and subjects: Fifty-one (51) patients with laryngeal papillomatosis who were treated at Keio University Hospital between May 1981 and April 2008 were incorporated in this study.Interventions: Individually formulated TCM was orally administered postsurgically to 20 patients with aggressive laryngeal papillomatosis requiring multiple laser ablations (at least biannually) because of frequent recurrence. Eight (8) patients were excluded because of discontinued visits or medication (6 patients), or malignant transformation of the lesion (2 patients). The remaining 12 patients were enrolled in this study.Outcome measures: Retrospective chart review and review of the patients' recorded laryngeal images were performed. Clinical response to TCM was measured by the surgical necessity and Derkay's severity score for each patient, followed by statistical analyses.Results: Surgeries were required statistically less often (p = 0.0029) after TCM administration compared with the pre-TCM period. Furthermore, Derkay's severity score was significantly lower (p = 0.022) at the patients' last visit compared with the score before TCM administration.Conclusions: TCM may be a useful adjuvant therapy to treat aggressive laryngeal papillomatosis. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pharmacological mechanism of TCM in the treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis."
"AbstractObjectives: As rates of opiate misuse rise in the United States, so do significant associated health and financial consequences to afflicted individuals, their families, and society at large. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is one evidence-based approach to treating opiate addiction, yet supplemental psychosocial treatment to support this approach is lacking. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) has shown to be efficacious in various substance use populations, but has yet to be assessed with MMT clients.Design: The current mixed methods study was designed to inform protocol adaptation for MMT clients and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MBRP for this population.Subjects: The sample consisted of adults (N = 15) recruited from a methadone clinic to participate in a 6-week MBRP course.Outcome measures: Data from focus groups and course satisfaction surveys supported feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Self-report outcome measures included depression, anxiety, craving, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and experiential avoidance, and were assessed at baseline and postcourse.Results: Mean scores on all primary outcomes changed in the expected direction at postcourse, and baseline to postcourse changes in depression, craving, and trauma symptoms reached statistical significance.Conclusions: Results from this initial pilot trial support feasibility and acceptability, and provide preliminary data on outcomes for future trials of mindfulness-based approaches within the MMT community."
"AbstractCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Hypertension is the most common single reason for visits to primary care physicians accounting for more than 35 million visits annually. Pharmacotherapy can achieve adequate control of blood pressure. Multiple interventions compares to single therapies are more efficacious in treating hypertension, and this fact supports using the holistic approach to hypertension treatment. Implementing an optimal healing environment (OHE) in a hypertension treatment regimen has the potential to impact not only health care costs, but also to optimize blood pressure control, and thus decrease the total cardiovascular disease burden. The research questions for the study of OHE in hypertension may differ between the individual patient perspective and the public health perspective. The use of a 2 × 2 factorial design would allow analysis of both perspectives simultaneously. Using an OHE setting with multiple interventions in formulating an individualized approach to hypertension management merits further exploration and research."
"AbstractObjectives: This study examines involvement with a range of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) during pregnancy on the use of pharmacologic (PPMT) and nonpharmacologic (NPMT) pain management techniques for labor and birth.Design: Longitudinal analysis of survey data.Participants: A substudy (n=2445) of the “young” cohort of the nationally representative Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health was conducted.Outcome measures: Use of PPMT and NPMT during labor and birth.Results: The survey was completed by 1835 women (response rate, 79.2%). Most respondents used either intrapartum PPMT (81.9%) or NPMT (74.4%). Many (60.7%) used some form of CAM during pregnancy and also used PPMT during birth. More than two thirds of women (66.7%) who used NPMT used CAM during pregnancy. There was a general trend of increased likelihood of NPMT use by women who applied CAM during pregnancy. There was an inverse effect on use of epidural analgesia for women who consumed herbal teas during pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.60).Conclusions: Because of the study design, this paper does not confirm a causative relationship between the use of CAM during pregnancy and intrapartum pain management choices. It does, however, indicate that the use of CAM during pregnancy may not significantly affect the uptake of intrapartum PPMT, despite possible attempts to reduce PPMT by using NPMT. It also highlights the possibility of potential interactions between CAM and PPMT, given the high prevalence of concomitant use."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to determine if grounding in the presence of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) encountered in a normal housing environment produces harmful currents in the human body.Design: This study had a test–retest design, with duration of 5–15 min per participant.Participants: There were 50 participants, of whom 23 were males aged 12–77 years (Mage ± standard deviation = 50.5 ± 19.5 years) and 27 were females aged 13–79 years (Mage ± standard deviation = 45.9 ± 19.0 years).Intervention: Each participant was instructed to touch a lamp on a desk with his or her left hand, then to move the hand away from the lamp (first one foot away and then three feet) while his/her body voltage was measured. Each participant was then grounded and instructed to repeat the same hand movements. Current was also measured during the grounded retest.Outcome measures: The measured parameters were alternating current (AC) body voltage and current generated from contact or proximity to a lamp and other appliances situated on top of a desk.Results: AC body voltage was reduced by an average of 58-fold when participants were grounded compared with when they were not grounded. AC currents generated during grounding were several orders of magnitude lower than the accepted minimum level of perception.Conclusion: Normal levels of EMFs existing in houses are too low to produce harmful currents when a person is grounded."
"AbstractObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness and possible side-effect of treating poststroke depression patients by traditional Chinese body acupuncture.Design: Single-blind double-simulated randomized controlled trial.Setting: Inpatient wards of neurology and rehabilitation departments.Participants: Sixty-eight (68) participants who met the criteria were randomly assigned into two groups, 34 cases (32 completed) into intervention group and 34 cases (33 completed) into control group.Interventions: Body acupuncture (Shuigou GV 26, Neiguan PC 6, and Zusanli ST 36) and oral placebo were used in intervention group while fluoxetine and minimal nontraditional acupuncture (minimally active penetrating) were used in control group. Patients in both groups were treated separately once a day for 6 weeks.Outcome measures: Outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and side-effects were measured using the Side Effect Rating Scale (SERS) of Asberg and a self-designed needling adverse events scale. Clinical effects of both groups were statistically valued before treatment, week-2, week-6, and month-3.Results: The total curative effects of both groups are similar (p > 0.05; evaluated in week-6 and month-3), while intervention group had an earlier onset time at week-2 (p < 0.05). The intervention group has fewer side-effects in week-2 (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Body acupuncture was effective in reducing stroke patients' depressive symptoms and had fewer side-effects. It should be considered as an option for neuropsychiatric sequelae of stroke."
"AbstractObjective: This study aimed to validate the effects of a simplified, gentle form of t'ai chi chuan in patients with type 2 diabetes and who are also obese.Design: The study was designed to be a randomized controlled trial.Setting: This study was conducted in the department of metabolism and endocrinology at Cheng Ching Hospital, in Taichung, Taiwan.Subjects: The study subjects were hospital-based patients with type 2 diabetes and who were also obese (ages 40–70, with a body–mass index [BMI] range of 30–35). The patients were randomly selected and grouped into t'ai chi exercise (TCE) and conventional exercise (CE) groups.Interventions: After receiving instruction in t'ai chi, the TCE group and the CE group practiced three times per week, including one practice session lasting up to 1 hour, for 12 weeks.Outcome measures: Hemoglobin A1C, serum lipid profile, serum malondialdehyde, and C-reactive protein were measured. Physical parameters of body weight and BMI were also measured. Diet and medications of participants were monitored carefully while biochemical and physical conditions were analyzed.Results: After 12 weeks, hemoglobin A1C values of the TCE group did not decrease (8.9 ± 2.7% : 8.3 ± 2.2%; p = 0.064). BMI (33.5 ± 4.8 : 31.3 ± 4.2; p = 0.038) and serum lipids, including triglyceride (214 ± 47 mg/dL : 171 ± 34 mg/dL; p = 0.012) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (38 ± 16 mg/dL : 45 ± 18 mg/dL; p = 0.023) had significant improvements. Serum malondialdehyde tended to decrease from baseline (2.66 ± 0.78 μmol/L : 2.31 ± 0.55 μmol/L; p = 0.035), and C-reactive protein also decreased (0.39 ± 0.19 mg/dL : 0.22 ± 0.15 mg/dL; p = 0.014). No improvements occurred in BMI, lipids, and oxidative stress profiles in the CE group.Conclusions:T'ai chi exercise practiced by patients who are obese and have type 2 diabetes is efficient and safe when supervised by professionals and helps improve parameters, such as BMI, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, and malondialdehyde. Periodic monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, physical fitness, and symptoms of discomfort of patients who exercise helps prevent injury. Simple, gentle TCE can be applied as regular daily exercise for patients with type 2 diabetes even when such patients are obese."
"AbstractObjective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem, but treatment is unsatisfactory. Although Chinese herbal medicines have been tried, there are limited data to support their usage. The authors set out to systematically review the effectiveness of the Chinese herbal medicine TongXieYaoFang (TXYF) and TXYF with different Chinese herbal additions (TXYF-A) in the management of IBS in order to make evidence-based recommendations.Methods: The authors searched the literature to identify randomized trials of TXYF or TXYF-A for patients with IBS by using MEDLINE,® EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Fields Specialized Register from 1966 to 2004, the CMB Disc database from January 1978 to December 1988, and the Full Text Chinese Journal database from January 1994 to December 2004. Standard forms regarding study design, treatment course, outcome measures, and adverse events were used to abstract data. Studies were assigned a quality score based on published methodology. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were analyzed.Results: Twelve studies (n = 1125) that met the criteria for review were identified. There was heterogeneity in the studies with regard to herbal formulas, control medicine, treatment course, and outcome measurement. The quality of all studies was low. The pooled analyses of effectiveness for the near-term (immediately after finishing the treatment course), short-term (3 months after finishing the treatment course), and long-term (6 months or more after finishing the treatment course) effectiveness showed that the effect of TXYF-A was better than that of conventional medicine in four, two, and six studies, respectively. The RRs were 1.34 (95% CI 1.16–1.54, p ⁢ 0.05), 1.39 (95% CI 1.17–1.64, p ⁢0.05), and 1.34 (95% CI 1.12–1.61, p < 0.05), respectively. Overall, combining all data from the 12 studies, the effectiveness of TXYF-As was higher than that in control groups, with statistical significance and RR of 1.35 (95% CI 1.21–1.50, p < 0.05).Conclusions: There is evidence to indicate the potential usefulness of TXYF-A for IBS patients. The results were limited by the poor quality and heterogeneity of these studies. Further studies with carefully designed, randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials will be needed to confirm the effectiveness of TXYF or TXYF-A for IBS."
"AbstractDrawing on recent paper published literature in both English and Chinese, this explores reactions to the evaluation of Chinese medicine using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the standards of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The literature review revealed a few sources which contend that Chinese medicine should not be evaluated on the basis of RCTs, but a far greater number which advocate for applying RCT and EBM standards to Chinese medicine. This paper describes the position of the detractors and points out ways in which their arguments contain oversimplified representations of Chinese medicine, biomedicine, EBM, and RCTs. In describing the position of the proponents, the analysis outlines some of the numerous innovative techniques they are developing for dealing with issues of control and standardization in efficacy research. Overall, the analysis indicates that important refinements are being generated in Chinese medicine research and clinical trial design in response to the challenges posed by the forced encounter of these two paradigms."
"AbstractObjectives: To review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of Chinese herbal medicine for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) systematically.Design: Electronic and manual searches identified RCTs comparing Chinese medicine integrated to conventional medicine versus conventional medicine alone. Methodological quality of trials was assessed by generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and intention-to-treat.Results: Eight RCTs (488 patients with SARS) were included. The methodological quality was generally low. The combined therapy showed significant reduction of mortality (relative risk 0.32 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.12 to 0.91]), shortened duration of fever, symptom relief, reductions in chest radiograph abnormalities, and reductions in secondary fungal infections among patients receiving glucocorticoids. There were no significant effects on quality of life or glucocorticoid dosage.Conclusion: Chinese herbal medicine combined with conventional medicine may have beneficial effects in patients with SARS. The evidence is insufficient because of the low methodological quality of the included trials."
"AbstractObjective: This study investigated the immunologic effects of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) on four types of immune cells in a human sample to determine the immunologic mechanism.Design: Five (5) participants consumed 6 mL of an Ashwagandha root extract twice daily for 96 hours. Ashwagandha was administered with anupana (whole milk). Peripheral blood samples were collected at 0, 24, and 96 hours and compared for differences in cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, and CD69 receptors by flow cytometry.Results: Significant increases were observed in the expression of CD4 on CD3+ T cells after 96 hours. CD56+ NK cells were also activated after 96 hours as evidenced by expression of the CD69 receptor. At 96 hours of use, mean values of receptor expression for all measured receptor types were increased over baseline, indicating that a major change in immune cell activation occurred across the sample.Conclusions: Effects on immune cell activation with use of Ashwagandha warrant further study."
"AbstractObjectives: The authors employ a Whole Systems framework to explore implementation of new guidelines for back and neck pain in Oregon's Medicaid system. Whole Systems research is useful for understanding the relationship between complementary and integrative health care (CIH) and conventional health care systems in real-world clinical and practice settings.Design: Preliminary results are from an observational study designed to evaluate state-wide implementation of CIH and other non-pharmacological treatments for neck and back pain among Oregon Medicaid patients. This natural experiment, even in early stages, provides insight into the challenges of integrating Whole Systems oriented therapies into Medicaid billing and treatment.Methods: Qualitative data are drawn from: (1) semi-structured interviews with representatives of each of the 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) responsible for administering the Oregon's Medicaid insurance through the Oregon Health Plan (OHP); and (2) open-ended survey responses from acupuncturists in all 16 CCO areas.Results: Implementation of the new policy guidelines poses logistical and epistemological challenges. Differences in worldview, inadequate reimbursement, and simple lack of awareness of CIH among medical providers are some of the factors that pose barriers to merging CIH therapies into conventional frameworks.Conclusions: In this article, we explore the potential for a Whole Systems perspective to better explain the complexity of integrating CIH and other non-pharmacological services into a state financed health care system. Oregon's expansion of services for back and neck pain presents an opportunity to explore challenges and successes in melding multiple approaches to health and pain management into a managed system such as the OHP."
"AbstractObjectives: Blood stasis is an important pathophysiologic concept in Traditional East Asian Medicine. It has been considered to be a pathogenic factor in chronic and incurable conditions such as pain, infertility, cancer, coronary heart disease, and others. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pain reduction by blood stasis treatment for blood stasis syndromes with traumatic injury.Methods: A single-center prospective pretest–post-test pilot study included 73 patients with a trauma that occurred within the past 2 weeks who were admitted into Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine from August 2015 through December 2015. Of the 50 patients analyzed in this study, 42 were women (mean age, 33.52). Triple Energizer-reinforcing Saam acupuncture set, herbal medicine (Dangkwisoo-san), and wet cupping on tender point, which are Korean medical therapies generally executed to treat post-traumatic pain, were performed. The patients had to receive at least six sessions of treatment during the 2 weeks, with subsequent treatment being performed within 3 ± 1 days after the previous treatment. Numeric rating scale (NRS) score and general pain severity indicator was measured as a primary outcome measure. The blood stasis questionnaire, oximetry, and patient's satisfaction were also measured.Results: The mean size of subcutaneous bleeding (width and length) and NRS score as a general pain indicator significantly decreased over the visits (all p < 0.01, visit 1 vs. visit 6). Among the blood stasis symptoms in the questionnaire, 11 blood stasis indicators significantly decreased (all p < 0.05). The patients showed significant improvement in the minimum and maximum value of peripheral perfusion index after the treatment (p = 0.011 and p = 0.15, respectively).Conclusions: This study reveals that blood stasis treatment may help improve the pain of patients with traumatic injury by enhancing the peripheral blood flow. The significant results observed in this study support some evidence of the theories of diagnosing blood stasis pattern and treatments of that pattern in Korean Medicine."
"AbstractObjectives: It has been reported that postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in patients over 60 years of age is aggravated under cold stimulation and is often difficult to treat. Keishikajutsubuto (TJ-18) and Bushi-matsu (TJ-3022) are traditional Japanese herbal medicines and have long been used to treat neuralgia and arthralgia, which are aggravated following cold stimulation. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined TJ-18 and TJ-3022 therapy in cases of PHN aggravated by self-reported cold stimulation.Design: Fifteen (15) PHN patients aged 60 years and over were examined. Patients were aware of the persistent pain despite other treatments; pain was generally aggravated following exposure to cold stimulation. First, TJ-18 (7.5 g/day) was administered to patients, and then TJ-3022 (1.0 g/day) was also administered and progressively increased by 0.5–1.0 g increments every 2–4 weeks, until stable improvement was achieved, which was rated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Analgesic effects were evaluated using the VAS during each patient visit.Outcome measures: Background variables, responses to treatment (time course of VAS rating, VAS improvement rate), the amount of additional TJ-3022 administered, and adverse reactions were analyzed.Results: Twelve (12) of the 15 patients completed the entire trial. Patient ages were 61–85 years, the male-to-female ratio was 4:8, and length of time after onset of herpes zoster was 2–92 months. In 3 patients, oral TJ-18 treatment was not possible due to hot flash or gastric discomfort. The VAS improvement rate for patients being orally administered both TJ-18 and TJ-3022 was 76.5±27.7% (mean±standard deviation). The additional TJ-3022 dose was 1.0–5.0 g/day. Twelve (12) patients have been treated without serious adverse reactions.Conclusions: TJ-18 and TJ-3022 combination treatment is a promising means of treating intractable PHN, which has a self-reported tendency to aggravate pain under cold stimulation."
"AbstractObjectives: There is increasing evidence for the extensive use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with dermatologic ailments amid a scarcity of information about teaching health providers on how to engage with patients who use CAM or request information about it. An approach to educating dermatologists and nurses about CAM is described in this paper.Design: A course on CAM and dermatology was offered to 17 dermatologists and nurses at a dermatology department in a university hospital in Israel. The course objective was to expose participants to common methods in CAM, emphasizing the role of an evidence-based approach and patient–doctor communication relating to CAM.Results: Course evaluation revealed that participants acknowledged the existence of evidence-based research as an important consideration before referring their patients to CAM.Conclusions: Teaching CAM to dermatologists and nurses using evidence-based medicine and a patient-centered approach could enable them to provide informed and balanced advice to their patients."
"AbstractObjectives: In line with the growing interest in integrated health care approaches, both nonindigenous (e.g., Western) and indigenous people are participating in healing ceremonies. However, little is known about the potential health-related benefit of healing ceremonies. Thus, the current study sought to close this gap in the literature by exploring the effect of healing ceremonies on participant's self-rated quality of life.Design: Data were gathered at three time points (T1: 4 weeks before ceremony; T2: 2 days before ceremony; T3: 4 weeks after ceremony).Participants: 25 persons with various diseases participated in the healing ceremony.Interventions: A 6-hour healing ceremony was conducted.Outcome measures: Mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual quality of life were assessed.Results: Participation in a healing ceremony increased mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual quality of life.Conclusions: As part of integrative health care, healing ceremonies are potentially useful for fostering participants' quality of life."
"AbstractObjective: To examine the effects of laughter therapy on secretory IgA (sIgA) in postpartum women.Methods: The study used a nonequivalent control group with nonsynchronized design. The participants were 76 postpartum women who agreed to participate in this study and were selected by convenience sampling (experimental group, n = 38; control group, n = 38). The data were collected from December 15, 2009, to April 8, 2010. The experimental group participated in a postpartum laughter program from a laughter therapy expert for 60 minutes per session, twice a week for 2 weeks, for a total of four sessions. To evaluate the effects of the postpartum laughter program, sIgA levels in breast milk were measured. The data were analyzed using SPSS WIN 20.0 software.Results: Immune response (sIgA) significantly differed between the experimental and control groups.Conclusion: A postpartum laughter program can be applied as a complementary and alternative intervention to postpartum women in a transitional mother-infant care center."
"AbstractContext: The human body emits ultraweak photons. It has been demonstrated that feedback regulation of ultraweak photon emission from the hand is detectable utilizing gelatin color filters in complete darkness. Color filters are commonly utilized in auriculomedicine diagnostic procedures based on the radial artery vascular autonomic signal.Objective: To evaluate the possibility of an effect by a dark-adapted red filter on (1) local ultraweak human photon emission using different anatomic locations, and (2) on systemic photon emission using one location for red filter exposure and another for photon emission recording.Design: Photon emission of abdomen, forehead, palm, and dorsum of the hand was recorded before and after the presence of a red filter. In addition, photon emission of forehead and dorsum of the hand was recorded before, during, and after the presence of the red filter close to the palm. In both instances, the filter was dark-adapted and placed in close proximity to, but not touching the skin of the dark-adapted subject. A low-noise, end window photomultiplier for recording ultraviolet and visible (200–650 nm) photon emission (with a very low background count rate) and designed for manipulation in three directions was situated in a dark room. The technology was utilized to record spontaneous photon emission of the abdomen, forehead, palm, and dorsum of the hand of one human male subject.Results: Data demonstrate that a dark-adapted subject responds in the total absence of light with a temporary increase in photon emission from the anatomic locations that had been exposed for 200 s at a distance of 3 cm to a dark-adapted red filter. Data from sequential time series suggest red filter initiation of a refractory emission reaction. Exposure of the palm to the red filter also evokes photon emission from the dorsum of the same hand and from the forehead. This response could be registered immediately after the beginning of the exposure. The stimulated emission is followed by a slow decrease of emission in the period after exposure to the filter.Conclusion: Data suggest that red filter–stimulated photon emission response is systemic and rapid. Data imply an exchange of information vis-à-vis light from both hand and red filter. The mechanism of such interaction is currently speculation only."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this pilot study was to test the effects of guided imagery on blood loss during the third stage of labor.Design and setting: This was a three-group randomized controlled trial. Recruitment was conducted from a university nurse-midwifery practice.Subjects: Sixty (60) women between pregnancy weeks 36 and 38 participated.Interventions: The women were randomized into experimental, placebo, and control groups.Outcome measures: Intrauterine pressure catheters were used to measure uterine contraction frequency and intensity. Blood loss was measured. Analysis of variance was used to compare the three groups on continuous variables.Results: Complete data were collected on 41 subjects. No significant differences were found among the groups on demographic or potentially confounding variables.Conclusions: Blood loss was nominally lower in the experimental group, but conclusions cannot be drawn due to the sample size."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to compare mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with a psycho-educational control group designed to be structurally equivalent to the MBCT program but excluding the claimed “active ingredient” of MBCT (i.e., mindfulness meditation practice) for the treatment of patients with major depression (MD).Design: This was a randomized controlled trial.Location: The study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Bologna, Italy.Subjects: Patients who had MD and who did not achieve remission following at least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment were considered for inclusion. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive MBCT or psycho-education and were prospectively followed for 8 weeks.Outcome measures: MD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life, as measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale, and the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI), respectively, were also included. All assessments were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Changes of psychologic variables over the study period were analyzed by means of the repeated-measures analysis of variance.Results: Of 29 screened subjects, 16 received MBCT or psycho-education. Both HAMD and PGWBI scores improved to a significantly higher extent in the MBCT group than in the psycho-educational control group.Conclusions: Although limited by a small sample size and the lack of follow-up measures, the results of this preliminary study suggest the superiority of MBCT over psycho-education for subjects who had MD and who did not achieve remission following antidepressant treatment."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) together with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to study the influence of acupuncture therapy on abdominal fat and hepatic fat content in obese children.Design: The design was a longitudinal, clinical intervention study of acupuncture therapy.Subjects: Subjects were 10 healthy, obese children (age: 11.4 ± 1.65 years, body–mass index [BMI]: 29.03 ± 4.81 kg/m2).Measurements: Measurements included various anthropometric parameters, abdominal fat (assessed by MRI) and hepatic fat content (assessed by 1H-MRS) at baseline and after 1 month of acupuncture therapy.Results: One (1) month of acupuncture therapy significantly reduced the subjects' BMI by 3.5% (p = 0.005), abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume by 16.04% (p < 0.0001), abdominal total adipose tissue volume by 10.45% (p = 0.001), and abdominal visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio by 10.59% (p = 0.007). Decreases in body weight (-2.13%), waist circumference (-1.44%), hip circumference (-0.33%), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (-0.99%), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volume (-5.63%), and intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content (-9.03%) were also observed, although these were not significant (p > 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the level of abdominal fat (SAT, VAT) and anthropometric parameters (weight, BMI, waist circumferences, hip circumferences). There was no statistically significant correlation between IHTG and anthropometric parameters or abdominal fat content.Conclusions: The first direct experimental evidence is provided demonstrating that acupuncture therapy significantly reduces BMI and abdominal adipose tissue by reducing abdominal VAT content without significant changes in body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR, abdominal SAT, or IHTG content. Thus, the use of acupuncture therapy to selectively target a reduction in abdominal VAT content should become more important and more popular in the future."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of physical therapy, including massage and exercise, on pain and mood in patients with advanced terminal cancer.Design: The design was a randomized controlled pilot study.Subjects: Twenty-four (24) patients with terminal cancer were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.Interventions: Group A received a physiotherapy intervention consisting of several massage techniques, mobilizations, and local and global exercises. Group B received a simple hand contact/touch to areas of pain (cervical area, shoulder, interscapular area, heels, and gastrocnemius), which was maintained for the same period of time as the intervention group. All patients received six sessions of 30–35 minutes in duration over a 2-week period.Outcomes: Outcomes were collected at baseline, at 1 week, and at a 2-week follow-up (after treatment completion) by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the participants. Outcomes included the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI, 0–10 scale), Memorial Pain Assessment Card (0–10 scale), and Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS Physical, Psychological, 0–4 scale). Baseline between-group differences were assessed with an independent t-test. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine the effects of the intervention.Results: There were no significant between-group baseline differences (p>0.2). A significant group×time interaction with greater improvements in group A was found for BPI worst pain (F=3.5, p=0.036), BPI pain right now (F=3.94, p=0.027), and BPI index (F=13.2, p<0.001), for MSAS Psychological (F=8.480, p=0.001). Conclusions: The combination of massage and exercises can reduce pain and improve mood in patients with terminal cancer. A sustained effect on pain and psychologic distress existed; however, parameters such as physical distress and the least pain were no greater in the intervention group as compared to the sham."
"AbstractObjectives: Although pediatric patients with chronic pain often turn to complementary therapies, little is known about patients who seek academic integrative pediatric care.Design: The study design comprised abstraction of intake forms and physician records from new patients whose primary concern was pain.Setting/location: The study setting was an academic pediatric clinic between January 2010 and December 2011.Subjects: Of the 110 new patients, 49 (45%) had a primary concern about headache (20), abdominal pain (18), or musculoskeletal pain (11).Results: The average age was 13±4 years, and 37% were male. Patients reported an average pain level of 6±3 on a 10-point scale, and most reported more than one kind of pain; parents had an average of 7±3 health concerns per child, including fatigue (47%), mood or anxiety (45%), constipation/diarrhea (41%), and/or sleep problems (35%). Most patients (57%) were referred by specialists; 71% were taking prescription medications; and 53% were taking one or more dietary supplements at intake. Of those tested, most (61%) had suboptimal vitamin D levels. All families wanted additional counseling about diet (76%), exercise (66%), sleep (58%), and/or stress management (81%). In addition to encouraging continued medical care (100%) and referral to other medical specialists (16%), frequent advice included continuing or initiating dietary supplements such as vitamins/minerals (80%), omega-3 fatty acids (67%), and probiotics (31%). Stress-reducing recommendations included biofeedback (33%), gratitude journals (16%), and yoga/t'ai chi (8%). Other referrals included acupuncture (24%) and massage (20%).Discussion: Patients who have chronic pain and who present to an integrative clinic frequently have complex conditions and care. They are interested in promoting a healthy lifestyle, reducing stress, and using selected complementary therapies.Conclusion: Patients with chronic pain who seek integrative care may benefit from the kind of coordinated, integrated, comprehensive care provided in a medical home."
"AbstractObjectives: Prompted by the need to find effective ways to enhance compliance in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and building on the increasing interest in dog-assisted interventions for this population, this study provides an exploratory test on whether dogs may assist children with severe ASD in complying with challenging demands while also decreasing behavioral and cardiovascular distress.Design: A within-subject design was used. Depending on condition, participants were allowed to engage with a particular stimulus—their preferred toy, a live dog, or a robotic dog—before being exposed to a demanding task in which they had to wait for permission to eat a desired food item (“prohibition task”). Although inactive, the stimulus remained present during the prohibition task.Subjects and settings: Ten male children, aged between 6 and 9 years and diagnosed with severe ASD, participated in this study. All were clinically referred as having serious compliance difficulties in everyday routines. Testing occurred at participants' homes.Outcome measures: Participants' emotional expressions, latency to distress, compliance levels, and behaviors that were shown during committed compliance were assessed during the prohibition task. In addition, cardiovascular reactivity to the task was monitored.Results: Obtained data revealed significant differences between conditions for some of the considered measures. Latency to distress was higher in the live dog than in the toy condition. Committed compliance was higher in the live dog than in the toy and robot conditions. Quiet waiting during committed compliance was higher in the live dog condition than in the toy condition, and tension release behaviors were lower. In addition, heart rate reactivity was lower in the live dog condition than in the toy condition.Conclusions: The live dog condition appeared to have a calming effect on the participants, hypothetically facilitating compliance. Although promising, these findings are only preliminary and their clinical significance needs to be assessed in future studies."
"AbstractObjective: To assess the response of cultured human tumor cells to infrasound in combination with conventional anticancer agents using an infrasound-emitting apparatus marketed as a therapeutic          device.Design: Two pilot experiments measured proliferation of cultured brain tumor cells exposed to three treatment conditions: infrasound emission alone, infrasound in combination with the          chemotherapy 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and infrasound in combination with ionizing radiation. Results from each experimental condition were compared to those from appropriate control conditions.Outcome          measure: A standard colony-forming efficiency assay was used to assess tumor cell proliferation.Results: Tumor cell proliferation was not significantly altered by treatment with infrasound          alone, nor did infrasound appear to influence cellular response to x-rays. There was a significant interaction between 5-FU and infrasound (P < 0.0001), however, evident in decreased colony formation.Conclusion: Further research is warranted to assess potential synergism between infrasound and 5-FU against tumor cell proliferation, and to investigate the possible therapeutic use of infrasound.

"AbstractContext: Many medical, nutrition, and education professionals have long suspected that poor diet impairs the academic performance of Western schoolchildren; academic performance often improves after improved diet. However, others have suggested that such academic gains may be due to psychologic effects rather than nutrition. To resolve this issue, two independent research teams conducted randomized trials in which children were given placebos or low-dose vitamin-mineral tablets designed to raise nutrient intake to the equivalent of a well-balanced diet. Both teams reported significantly greater gains in nonverbal intelligence among the supplemented groups. The findings were important because of the apparent inadequacy of diet they revealed and the magnitude of the potential for increased intelligence. However, none of the ten subsequent replications, or the two original trials, were without limitations leaving this issue in controversy.Objectives: To determine if schoolchildren who consume low-dose vitamin-mineral tablets will have a significantly larger increase in nonverbal intelligence than children who consume placebos in a study that overcomes the primary criticisms directed at the previous 12 controlled trials.Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using stratified randomization within each teacher's class based on preintervention nonverbal intelligence.Settings and Subjects: Two ""working class,"" primarily Hispanic, elementary schools in Phoenix, Arizona, participated in the study. Slightly more than half the teachers in each school distributed the tablets daily to 245 schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years.Intervention: Daily vitamin-mineral supplementation at 50% of the U.S. daily recommended allowance (RDA) for 3 months versus placebo.Outcome Measures: Post-test nonverbal IQ, as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), while controlling for pretest nonverbal IQ as a covariate.Four Main Results: First, a significant difference of 2.5 IQ points (95% CI: 1.85–3.15) was found between 125 children given active tablets and 120 children given placebo tablets (p = 0.038). Second, this finding is consistent with the mean 3.2 IQ point net gain found in the 12 similar but less rigorous studies. Third, a significantly higher proportion of children in the active group gained 15 or more IQ points when compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01). Fourth, although 81 matched pairs produced no difference at all in nonverbal IQ gain, the modest 2.5 IQ point net gain for the entire sample can be explained by the remaining 24 children who took active tablets, and had a 16 point higher net gain in IQ than the remaining 19 placebo controls.Conclusions: This study confirms that vitamin-mineral supplementation modestly raised the nonverbal intelligence of some groups of Western schoolchildren by 2 to 3 points but not that of most Western schoolchildren, presumably because the majority were already adequately nourished. This study also confirms that vitamin-mineral supplementation markedly raises the nonverbal intelligence of a minority of Western schoolchildren, presumably because they were too poorly nourished before supplementation for optimal brain function. Because nonverbal intelligence is closely associated with academic performance, it follows that schools with children who consume substandard diets should find it difficult to produce academic performance equal to those schools with children who consume diets that come closer to providing the nutrients suggested in the U.S. RDA. The parents of schoolchildren whose academic performance is substandard would be well advised to seek a nutritionally oriented physician for assessment of their children's nutritional status as a possible etiology."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga, compared to physical activity on the cognitive performance in 7–9 year-old schoolchildren from a socioeconomic disadvantaged background.Design: Two hundred (200) schoolchildren from Bangalore, India, after baseline assessment of cognitive functioning were randomly allocated to either a yoga or a physical-activity group. Cognitive functions (attention and concentration, visuo–spatial abilities, verbal ability, and abstract thinking) were assessed using an Indian adaptation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at baseline, after 3 months of intervention, and later at a 3-month follow-up.Results: Of the 200 subjects, 193 were assessed at 3 months after the study, and then 180 were assessed at the 3-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the two study groups (yoga versus physical activity) at postintervention, after controlling for grade levels. Improvement in the mean scores of cognitive tests following intervention varied from 0.5 (Arithmetic) to 1.4 (Coding) for the yoga group and 0.7 (Arithmetic) to 1.6 (Vocabulary) in the physical-activity group.Conclusions: Yoga was as effective as physical activity in improving cognitive performance in 7–9 year old schoolchildren. Further studies are needed to examine the dose–response relationship between yoga and cognitive performance."
"AbstractBackground: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has an increasing presence in dermatology. Complementary therapies have been studied in many skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.Objectives: This study sought to assess oral CAM use in dermatology relative to medicine as a whole in the United States, using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.Design: Variables studied include patient demographic characteristics, diagnoses, and CAM documented at the visits. A brief literature review of the top 5 CAM treatments unique to dermatology visits was performed.Results: Most CAM users in both dermatology and medicine as a whole were female and white and were insured with private insurance or Medicare. Fish oil, glucosamine, glucosamine chondroitin, and omega-3 were the most common complementary supplements used in both samples.Conclusions: CAM use in dermatology appears to be part of a larger trend in medicine. Knowledge of common complementary therapies can help dermatologists navigate this expanding field."
"AbstractObjectives: To report the results of health economic analyses comparing two treatment approaches for chronic low back pain (CLBP).Design: Observational prospective cohort study comparing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CLBP care provided at an integrative care clinic with that provided in other clinics within the same hospital. CLBP-related medical utilization, function, quality of life, and days of work incapacity were self-reported at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.Settings/Location: Osher Clinical Center (OCC) based at a tertiary academic hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH]) and other clinics at BWH.Subjects: CLBP patients seeking care at OCC or non-OCC BWH clinics.Interventions: Integrative or conventional care for CLBP as prescribed by the treating clinician(s).Outcome measures: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated per treatment approach based on the SF-12. Cost per QALY gained was evaluated using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICERs based on CLBP-specific effectiveness measures (Roland Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and bothersomeness of pain [BOP]) were exploratory outcomes.Results: Total adjusted annual CLBP-related costs per patient were greater in the OCC versus non-OCC group ($11,526.73 vs. $6,810.63). Between group differences in QALYs were small and ICER estimate of cost per QALY gained was high ($436,676). However, unadjusted mean direct costs per patient decreased over time in the OCC group. Savings in direct costs of $391 (95% confidence interval: −1,078 to 1,861) were observed in the OCC group for the 6- to 12-month period, driven primarily by reduced medication usage. ICERs based on adjusted RDQ and BOP group differences showed cost of $2,073 and $4,203 for a one-point reduction per respective scale.Conclusions: When adjusted for baseline differences, self-reported costs were higher in the OCC group with only small effects on QALYs. However, trends toward decreased direct expenditures and medication usage over time warrant further investigation. Future studies evaluating potential benefits of integrative care models for the management of CLBP should employ randomized designs, longer observational periods, and explore multiple metrics of cost-effectiveness."
AbstractObjectives: The study objective was to study the change in the critical flicker fusion (CFF) after a yogic visual concentration practice (trataka).Design: Thirty (30) subjects participated in a study where they were evaluated for the CFF immediately before and after the practice. The subjects also participated in a comparable control session.Subjects: The subjects were 30 volunteers in the age range 25–40. Fifteen (15) of the volunteers were male. The mean age was 31.33 ± 4.67.Results: The CFF showed a statistically significant increase from 37.35 ± 2.84 to 38.66 ± 2.91 after the yoga practice of trataka. The control session did not produce a statistically significant change in the CFF.Conclusions: An increase in the CFF is seen immediately after the yogic concentration practice called trataka.
"AbstractNeuropeptides have been implicated in many important brain activities. The continuing discovery of new neuropeptides, and of new functions for already discovered neuropeptides leads to the speculation that more than one neuropeptide can be implicated in any acupuncture treatment. The past and current research on neuropeptides involved in mediating acupuncture effects are reviewed, and illustrate some of the pitfalls of such research. The problem in identifying which one(s) mediate(s) which specific organism response is not only related to the kind of acupuncture manipulations used but also to the methodology and experimental design adopted to rule out other well-known phenomena, such as stress and conditioning, superimposed on the acupuncture effects."
"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the prevalence of special diet adoption in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and parental perceptions of efficacy.Design: An online survey was distributed over a year to nearly 20,000 individuals.Results: Responses from 261 parents of patients with JIA were received. One of three (n = 79) had tried special diets, including gluten-free (66%), anti-inflammatory (41%), and lactose-free (25%). Overall, >50% of 79 parents reported that patients had improved pain or joint swelling.Conclusions: Special diets have been trialed by a third of the patients, with over half reporting symptom improvement. A prospective, controlled trial is warranted to test the efficacy of a dietary approach to JIA."
"AbstractObjectives: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by patients could interact in unpredictable ways with conventional therapies. This trial was designed to study the prevalence, types, and clinical implications of CAM use in patients with cancer who are receiving radiotherapy.Design: A validated questionnaire was given to consenting outpatients in this ethics-approved study. Questions specified types of CAM used, clinician knowledge, reason for use, perceived effectiveness, safety, and cost.Results: Of the 101 assessable questionnaires, 38 patients (38%) of the total patient group used CAM, with vitamins (53%), antioxidants (29%), spiritual/meditation practices (29%), and herbs (18%) being the most commonly used. The intention of CAM use was to improve quality of life in 69% of patients and for either hope of cure or to assist other forms of treatment in 26%. The majority of patients (58%) were using CAM prior to their diagnosis of cancer, with 40% starting at diagnosis or during conventional treatment. Patients spent up to $300/month on CAM use. Patients using CAM were significantly more likely to also receive chemotherapy versus non-CAM users (45% versus 24%, p=0.045). Significantly fewer CAM users expected cure from conventional therapy, compared to non-CAM users (50% versus 75%, p=0.016). More CAM users expected conventional therapy to prolong life (58% versus 32%, p<0.001). Only 40% discussed CAM use with their oncologists.Conclusions: CAM is commonly used by patients with cancer. CAMs, particularly antioxidants, are being taken which could negate the underlying free-radical tumorcidal effects of radiotherapy. Oncologists need to have greater awareness of this use and of its potential adverse consequences."
"AbstractObjectives: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 50 million Americans have been diagnosed with arthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases. The purpose of the current study was to (1) estimate the prevalence of overall complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and (2) examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on CAM use among normal weight, overweight, and obese persons with chronic lower back pain, chronic neck pain, chronic/rheumatoid arthritis, or musculoskeletal diseases, while controlling for other covariates.Design: Cross-sectional design using secondary data for 9724 adults from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey. Data were weighted and analyzed by using Stata 12 for Windows (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression statistics were computed.Participants: The participants were randomly surveyed from U.S. households.Outcome measures: CAM use was measured as reported use of any modality within the five National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health domains.Results: CAM use was statistically significantly associated with female sex; race/ethnicity; having chronic neck pain, lower back pain, or chronic/rheumatoid arthritis; having limitations due to chronic disease; and geographic region (p < 0.05). Factors significantly associated with decreased odds of CAM use included age 50–64 years, income categorized as “other/missing,” and having musculoskeletal diseases. Stratification by body mass index suggested increased odds of CAM use among normal/underweight persons with chronic neck pain but decreased odds for those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. For overweight patients, increased odds of CAM use were significant for chronic lower back pain, musculoskeletal diseases, and chronic/rheumatoid arthritis.Conclusions: Musculoskeletal diseases and arthritis represent important public health problems with economic implications for the well-being of individuals and society. Identifying CAM use trends by patient weight can be used to improve strategies to increase awareness and access to CAM as part of comprehensive and cost-effective approaches for the management and treatment of these conditions."
"AbstractObjective: To evaluate the effect of hippotherapy (physical therapy utilizing the movement of a horse) on muscle activity in children with spastic cerebral palsy.Design: Pretest/post-test          control group.Setting/location: Therapeutic Riding of Tucson (TROT), Tucson, AZ.Subjects: Fifteen (15) children ranging from 4 to 12 years of age diagnosed with spastic cerebral          palsy.Interventions: Children meeting inclusion criteria were randomized to either 8 minutes of hippotherapy or 8 minutes astride a stationary barrel.Outcome measures: Remote surface          electromyography (EMG) was used to measure muscle activity of the trunk and upper legs during sitting, standing, and walking tasks before and after each intervention.Results: After hippotherapy,          significant improvement in symmetry of muscle activity was noted in those muscle groups displaying the highest asymmetry prior to hippotherapy. No significant change was noted after sitting astride a barrel.Conclusions: Eight minutes of hippotherapy, but not stationary sitting astride a barrel, resulted in improved symmetry in muscle activity in children with spastic cerebral palsy. These results          suggest that the movement of the horse rather than passive stretching accounts for the measured improvements.      "
"AbstractObjectives: To evaluate the effect of two inhaled essential oils (black pepper or angelica) on the nicotine habits of students, staff, and faculty on a U.S. college campus.Design: Comparative study with pre-/post-test measures.Setting: Community college in rural East Texas.Participants: Convenience sample of 20 volunteers from the college community (students, faculty, and staff) who were regular (daily) users of nicotine (cigarettes, snuff, or chewing tobacco).Interventions: Inhalation of one drop of essential oil on a tissue for 2 minutes when participant was craving nicotine.Outcome Measures: (1) Pre-inhalation journal recording of self-assessed level of craving for nicotine on a 0–10 scale, (2) post-inhalation journal recording of self-assessed level of craving for nicotine on a 0–10 scale, and (3) minutes that participant waited from start of inhalation until next use of tobacco.Results: Both black pepper and angelica reduced the level of nicotine craving and allowed a longer delay before next use of tobacco. However, black pepper reduced the level of craving more than did angelica, and angelica allowed for a longer delay than did black pepper.Conclusions: Aromatherapy may be useful in nicotine withdrawal. Further studies are warranted."
"AbstractObjectives: To explore the methodology for investigating the tenderness of acupuncture points, with particular reference to the hypothesis that the point Spleen 6 (SP6) is more tender in women than in men.Design: Single-blind, observational study with volunteers.Setting: University of Exeter, U.K.Subjects: Student volunteers, 13 male and 13 female.Outcome measures: Pressure thresholds at SP6, a control acupuncture point Stomach 36, and two nonacupuncture control sites in each leg were measured weekly for 4 weeks.Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the pressure thresholds of SP6 in women and those in men.Conclusion: The present study provides no strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the acupuncture point SP6 is more tender in women and in men. Recommendations for further investigations are discussed."
"AbstractObjectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of practicing qigong on middle-age subjects with essential hypertension. Impacts on blood pressure, reported self-efficacy, perceived benefit, and emotion were observed.Design: Thirty-six (36) adult volunteers were assigned to either a waiting list control or a qigong group that practiced two 30-minute qigong programs per week over 8 consecutive weeks.Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in members of the qigong group after 8 weeks of exercise. Significant improvements in self-efficacy and other cognitive perceptual efficacy variables were also documented in the qigong group compared to the original situation described above.Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates the positive effects of practicing qigong on controlling blood pressure and enhancing perceptions of self-efficacy."
"AbstractObjective: To identify the neural correlates of the state of mental silence as experienced through Sahaja yoga meditation.Design: Nineteen experienced meditators underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during three short consecutive meditation periods, contrasted with a control relaxation condition.Results: Relative to baseline, at the beginning of the meditation sessions there was a significant increase of activation in bilateral inferior frontal and temporal regions. Activation became progressively more reduced with deeper meditation stages and in the last meditation session it became localized to the right inferior frontal cortex/ right insula and right middle/superior temporal cortex. Furthermore, right inferior frontal activation was directly associated with the subjective depth of the mental silence experience.Conclusions: Meditators appear to pass through an initial intense neural self-control process necessary to silence their mind. After this they experience relatively reduced brain activation concomitant with the deepening of the state of mental silence over right inferior frontal cortex, probably reflecting an effortless process of attentional contemplation associated with this state."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to highlight features of pragmatic real-world integrative oncology research by applying the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2) criteria to an ongoing integrative oncology clinical trial. The ongoing trial is a preference-based randomized comparative effectiveness trial of mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) versus t'ai chi/qigong (TCQ) for cancer survivors (the Mindfulness and T'ai Chi for Cancer Health [MATCH] study). The primary outcome of the MATCH study is distress, and secondary outcomes are quality of life, sleep disturbance, and physical functioning. The clinical trial is being undertaken at tertiary care cancer centers across two sites in Canada: Calgary (AB) and Toronto (ON), with a sample of 600 cancer survivors who have finished all cancer treatments and are distressed.Methods and Results: The MATCH trial was scored on the explanatory–pragmatic continuum for each of the nine domains of the PRECIS-2 criteria on a scale of 1–5, and was rated as more explanatory than pragmatic, despite initial design efforts being more pragmatic. Areas that were least pragmatic were methods of recruitment, follow-up, and intervention delivery. The more pragmatic areas were setting, outcomes, and data analysis.Conclusions: More efforts toward conducting pragmatic trials are needed in the field of integrative oncology, as cancer-care institutions and policy makers are looking for sustainable interventions within already established treatment models. The PRECIS-2 criteria can help researchers meet these goals in the planning stages of trial development."
"AbstractBackground: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a propolis rinse on induced gingivitis by using the co-twin study design.Methods: Twenty-one twin pairs (n=42) were enrolled in a gingivitis study with oral hygiene promotion (14 days) and gingivitis induction (21 days). During the gingivitis induction phase, one member of the twin pair was randomly assigned to a 2% typified propolis rinse, and the other was assigned a color-matched 0.05% sodium fluoride plus 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride rinse (positive control). Patients rinsed twice daily with 20 mL for 30 seconds for 21 days. Gingivitis was measured on days −14 (baseline), 0 (after hygiene phase), and 21 (after no-hygiene phase) by using the Papillary Bleeding Score (PBS) and by standard digital imaging of the gum tissues (G-parameter).Results: The 38 persons who completed the study (age 13–22 years) were well balanced according to PBS at baseline and G-parameter after the initial hygiene phase. After 21 days without oral hygiene, the propolis rinse and positive control rinse groups did not differ significantly for average PBS measurements or G-parameter.Conclusions: Use of a 2% typified propolis rinse was equivalent to a positive control rinse during a 21-day no-hygiene period."
"AbstractObjectives: In previous University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studies, nocturnal illumination shortened menstrual cycles that were longer than 33 days. The studies reported here extend the previous findings, confining the illumination to the sleep period. Design: Two light levels (235 to 250 lux and less than 1 lux) and 2 modes of light delivery (lighted sleep mask and bedside lamp) were tested. Results: 235 to 250 lux treatment cycle lengths were significantly shorter than baseline, but not significantly shorter than the less than 1 lux treatment cycle lengths. Subjective reports of sleep disturbance were greater with the 235 to 250 lux treatment, but there was no significant difference in overall quality of sleep between the two light levels. Conclusions: The current data alone do not exclude spontaneous remission or suggestion, but our previous studies demonstrated significant contrasts between 235 to 250 lux and less than 1 lux light levels. This study suggests that treatment may be effective when confined to the sleep period, and that light masks, which do not disturb bed partners, may be used in place of bedside lamps."
"AbstractReiki is one type of alternative therapy that is increasing in popularity. It is advocated by its practitioners as a precise method for connecting universal life energy with the body's innate process of healing through hands-on techniques. The claim of Reiki practitioners is that Reiki reduces a variety of physical problems and improves psychospiritual well-being. There are abundant anecdotal records that support the previous claim, and a few pioneer scientific studies are starting to emerge. Although the Reiki research in totality supports the anecdotal records, the absence of randomized and placebo-controlled trials precludes the interpretation of the outcomes as resulting from specific effects as opposed to placebo effects plus natural history. Authorities in the field indicate that researchers interested in placebo-controlled studies should have the placebo treatment look exactly like the real intervention in every respect. Because no studies could be found in the literature that tested standardization procedures for real and placebo Reiki, the decision was made to conduct one. The purpose of this study was to test the standardization procedures developed by our research team for placebo Reiki, before going ahead and conducting our planned full-scale randomized and placebo-controlled Reiki efficacy study. This study used a 4-round, crossover experimental design in which 20 blinded subjects (12 students, 4 breast cancer survivors, and 4 observers) were exposed to a combination of 2 interventions (Reiki plus Reiki, or placebo plus placebo, or Reiki plus placebo, or placebo plus Reiki); and were then asked to evaluate the interventions using a self-administered questionnaire. The blinded observers were used in round number 4. Two real Reiki practitioners in the Usui system were chosen first, then 2 placebo practitioners who closely resembled them were recruited. The placebo practitioners were trained in Reiki by the study Reiki Master and the principal investigator, but were not initiated. The belief in Reiki is that only practitioners that are initiated could give Reiki, thus making it possible to have a placebo arm in efficacy studies. The findings of the study indicate that the developed standardization procedures were successful because none of the final participants in round 4 (4 breast cancer patients and 4 observers) could differentiate between the identity of placebo and Reiki practitioners. The qualitative comments expressed by the participants further confirmed the quantitative data. It was concluded based on these findings that it is safe to go ahead and conduct the planned randomized 3-arm Reiki efficacy clinical trial. It is recommended that scholars interested in Reiki research could incorporate our techniques to strengthen their designs by adding a placebo arm."
"AbstractObjective: To document the diversity and traditional use of tropical plants as medicine by the indigenous people of southeast Nigeria.Design: Information was obtained by interviews conducted with the aid of questionnaires and facilitators during field surveys carried out from January 1993 to June 1994. Voucher herbarium specimens were identified at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Herbarium, in collaboration with Bernhard Zepernick (former Curator), Botanisches Museum, Berlin. Specimens were photographed.Results: Data are summarized in the form of a table, summarizing the plants commonly used by the traditional doctors or medicine men. Herbal preparations are arranged alphabetically under family and species. The data are presented in the order: botanical name, collection number, vernacular name, locality, plant habit/status, and reported medicinal applications."
"AbstractBackground: Although classic massage is used widely in Germany and elsewhere for treating chronic pain conditions, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT).Design: Pragmatic RCT          of classic massage compared to standard medical care (SMC) in chronic pain conditions of back, neck, shoulders, head and limbs.Outcome measure: Pain rating (nine-point Likert-scale; predefined          main outcome criterion) at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 3 month follow-up, as well as pain adjective list, depression, anxiety, mood, and body concept.Results: Because of political and          organizational problems, only 29 patients were randomized, 19 to receive massage, 10 to SMC. Pain improved significantly in both groups, but only in the massage group was it still significantly improved          at follow-up. Depression and anxiety were improved significantly by both treatments, yet only in the massage group maintained at follow-up.Conclusion: Despite its limitation resulting from problems          with numbers and randomization this study shows that massage can be at least as effective as SMC in chronic pain syndromes. Relative changes are equal, but tend to last longer and to generalize more into          psychologic domains. Because this is a pilot study, the results need replication, but our experiences might be useful for other researchers.      "
"AbstractObjectives: A number of studies suggest that postprandial hyperglycemia produces oxidative stress, leading to complications associated with diabetes. However, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may affect groups of people other than diabetics, such as smokers and athletes with specific diet plans. Based on previous reports that seated breathing meditation reduces hyperglycemia, the present study was designed to determine the effects of diaphragmatic breathing on postprandial plasma glycemia, insulin, oxidative stress, and antioxidant levels in athletes with normal glucose metabolism.Design: Data collected before and after consumption of a 900-calorie breakfast composed of 80% carbohydrates, 10% proteins, and 10% lipids were analyzed. Ten (10) minutes after the meal, 8 subjects spent 40 minutes performing diaphragmatic breathing in a quiet place. The other 8 subjects, representing the control group, spent the same time sitting in an equivalent quiet place reading a magazine.Subjects: Data from 16 amateur male cyclists age 30.12±4.9 years (±SD) were analyzed. Their mean height and weight were 177.81±5.3 cm and 71.40±5.2 kg, respectively. All subjects underwent a physical examination and were determined to be in good health.Outcome measures: Blood samples were collected immediately before the meal as well as 1 hour and 2 hours after the meal, and plasma levels of glucose, insulin, reactive oxygen metabolites, and biologic antioxidant potential were determined. Heart rate was also recorded.Results: Results show that in normal subjects, acute hyperglycemia induces free-radical production while reducing the antioxidant levels (p<0.05). Diaphragmatic breathing reduces heart rates (p<0.01), increases insulin (p<0.05), reduces glycemia (p<0.01), and reduces free-radical production as indicated by the higher antioxidants levels (p<0.05).Conclusions: Diaphragmatic breathing, likely through the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, increases insulin, reduces glycemia, and reduces reactive oxygen species production."
"AbstractObjectives: This study investigated the effect of acupuncture needles developed for double-blind (practitioner–patient blinding) trials employing a tapping-in method that is commonly used to penetrate the skin in Japanese-style acupuncture.Design, subjects, and interventions: An acupuncturist applied a penetrating, a skin-touch placebo, and a no-touch control needle designed to blind both practitioners and patients in the forearm in 80 healthy subjects (patients) by tapping-in method.Setting: The setting was a practice room of the Japan School of Acupuncture, Moxibustion and Physiotherapy, Tokyo, Japan.Outcome measures: The outcome measures were the acupuncturist's and subjects' guesses at the type of needles and confidence of their guesses on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The subjects were asked about pain with needle application.Results: The number of correct/incorrect guesses (the latter including unidentified) of the acupuncturist were 73/167 with a confidence of 55.2±16.9 (mean±standard deviation) on the VAS. The subjects identified 148 needles correctly and 92 needles incorrectly, the mean confidence being 71.0±28.4. There were a few penetrating and skin-touch placebo needles that the subjects guessed as “no-touch.” Whereas few of the 80 no-touch control needles were guessed as “penetrating,” 16% of them were guessed as “skin-touch” and 11% were reported as “unidentifiable” by the subjects. Forty percent (40%) of the penetrating needles and 50% of the skin-touch placebo needles did not elicit skin penetration pain.Conclusions: The effect of practitioner blinding employing the needles for double blinding with the tapping-in method was satisfactory. It was difficult to blind the subjects when no-touch control needles together with penetrating and skin-touch placebo needles were used."
"AbstractObjectives: To investigate the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, including botanical/herbal remedies, among Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), New Jersey site. We also examined whether attitudes toward CAM and communication of its use to providers differed for Hispanic and non-Hispanic women.Study design: SWAN is a community-based, multiethnic cohort study of midlife women. At the 13th SWAN follow-up, women at the New Jersey site completed both a general CAM questionnaire and a culturally sensitive CAM questionnaire designed to capture herbal products commonly used in Hispanic/Latina communities. Prevalence of and attitudes toward CAM use were compared by race/ethnicity and demographic characteristics.Results: Among 171 women (average age 61.8 years), the overall prevalence of herbal remedy use was high in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women (88.8% Hispanic and 81.3% non-Hispanic white), and prayer and herbal teas were the most common modalities used. Women reported the use of multiple herbal modalities (mean 6.6 for Hispanic and 4.0 for non-Hispanic white women; p = 0.001). Hispanic women were less likely to consider herbal treatment drugs (16% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.005) and were less likely to report sharing the use of herbal remedies with their doctors (14.4% Hispanic vs. 34% non-Hispanic white; p = 0.001). The number of modalities used was similar regardless of the number of prescription medications used.Conclusions: High prevalence of herbal CAM use was observed for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women. Results highlight the need for healthcare providers to query women regarding CAM use to identify potential interactions with traditional treatments and to determine whether CAM is used in lieu of traditional medications."
"AbstractObjective: To investigate the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by an end-of- life population.Design: Random selection of death certificates used to locate family caregivers who were interviewed by telephone 2–5 months following decedents' deaths.Participants: Decedent subjects died of natural causes in community settings. Family caregivers were very involved in the care and decision making for decedents during their terminal illness.Measure: Family caregivers reported on whether decedents had used CAM, type of modality, and motivation for use.Results: CAM use by decedents was reported by 53.7% of family caregivers. Decedents who had used CAM were more likely to be younger, to have college degrees and higher household incomes, and to have used one or more life-sustaining treatment. The most frequent reason the decedents had used CAM was for symptom relief.Conclusions: As baby boomers age, bringing their CAM familiarity and previous practices into the end-of-life phase, clinicians will need to be aware that CAM use for symptom control is likely to be prevalent."
"AbstractObjectives: As complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) continues to assume influence in medical care delivery, biomedical orthodoxy has contemporaneously experienced landmark technoscientific advances, tempting analysts to question the relevance of CAM to 21st century medical provision. This article focuses on one representation of contemporary advances in biomedicine, namely, the phenomenon of personalized medicine (PM) and the technoscientific contexts for its evolution. It examines whether biomedicine's embrace of the PM concept widens the conceptual and philosophical gulf between it and CAM.Design: Focusing on genomics and its translation into PM, the article finds that presently, the gene–environment dynamic is an important aspect of genomics and PM. However, there is a lopsided emphasis in the gene–environment matrix that focuses on toxicogenomics (i.e., the effect of toxins and chemicals, including drugs on genes and genetic materials). This approach to genomics ignores the role of other environmental stressors, which constitute components of an individual's health experience critical to PM.Conclusions: If this lopsided approach is addressed, in a counterintuitive way, PM has potential for engendering a confluence between biomedicine and CAM as a part of the paradox of the 21st century medical landscape."
"AbstractObjectives: Washington was the first state to require insurance companies to cover all categories of licensed providers. The purpose of this paper was to examine the effect of Washington's law on coverage decisions of major health plans.Design: The study uses literature and document review as well as key informant interviews.Settings/location: The study focuses on legislation and other legal activity in the state of Washington. The key informant interviews are focused on the decisions of three major health plans.Results: Although the law had a major effect on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) coverage in Washington, the impact on the use of CAM services and expenditures has been bounded by changing market forces.Conclusions: CAM providers face scientific tests of measurable efficacy and market tests of consumer value. In this economic environment, CAM stakeholders will have to work hard to maintain their political gains."
"AbstractObjective: Conventional models of placebo effects assume that all mind–body responses associated with expectation can be explained by ordinary causal processes. This experiment tested whether some placebo effects may also involve retrocausal, or time-reversed, influences.Design: Slow cortical potentials in the brain were monitored while adult volunteers anticipated either a flash of light or no flash, selected with equal probability by a noise-based random number generator. Data were collected in individual sessions of 100 trials, contributed by 13 female and 7 male adult participants.Outcome measures: Ensemble median slow cortical potentials 1 second prior to a light flash were compared with the same measures prior to no flash. A nonparametric randomized permutation technique was used to statistically assess the observed difference. Electroencephalographic data were analyzed separately by gender.Results: Females' slow cortical potentials significantly differentiated before stimulus onset (z = 2.72, p = 0.007, two-tailed); males showed a suggestive effect in the opposite direction (z = −1.64, p = 0.10, two-tailed). Examination of alternative explanations indicated that the significant effect in females was not caused by anticipatory strategies, equipment or environmental artifacts, or violation of statistical assumptions.Conclusions: This experiment, in accordance with previous studies showing similar, unconscious “presentiment” effects in humans, suggests that comprehensive models seeking to explain placebo effects, and in general how expectation affects the mind and body, may require consideration of retrocausal influences."
"AbstractPurpose: The objective of this study was to assess if kudzu root extract influences the drinking habits of veterans who entered a substance abuse treatment program.Design: Prospective, randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial.Setting: A nonacademic Veteran Affairs Medical Center.Methods: Patients with the diagnosis of alcoholism were randomly assigned to receive either kudzu root extract 1.2 g twice daily or a matching placebo. Patients completed questionnaires that focused on craving for alcohol and sobriety status on a monthly basis.Outcome measures: Sobriety level and craving for ethanol were assessed on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10.Results: Thirty-eight patients completed 1 month of the study; 21 randomly assigned kudzu, 17 to placebo. No statistically significance difference in craving and sobriety scores were noted after 1 month between kudzu and placebo, or at later stages with smaller numbers (15–19) of patients.Conclusion: In this small patient population, kudzu root appeared to be no better than placebo in reducing the craving for alcohol or promoting sobriety."
"AbstractBlinding is important in the conduct of clinical trials, yet it generally receives less attention and effort than other trial components (e.g., randomization, compliance) that are rigorously treated in the design and/or analysis stages. Furthermore, although the word “blind” commonly appears in the titles of publications, its use is not always well justified. We are human beings, and our behavior or decisions can change depending on whether our eyes are open or closed. That is why virtually everyone in the clinical trial community, including subjects, investigators, treating practitioners, and outcome assessors, would agree that some form of blinding is needed to reach a fair and objective conclusion uninfluenced by knowledge of intervention assignment. Despite our best efforts, however, blinding may not always be successful. There is a considerable body of literature about blinding and the need to assess whether it has been properly implemented and maintained. By discussing how the trialist and the team may handle blinding-related issues in different stages of a clinical trial, this brief article intends to offer reasonable suggestions that could improve current practice, helping researchers deal confidently with blinding-related issues and research in a manner that meets rigorous standards, but is practical and flexible."
"AbstractObjectives: To determine if exogenous S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), a commonly used nutritional supplement, increases the level of plasma homocysteine (Hcy), a potential cardiovascular risk factor, in healthy human subjects.Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.Setting: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.Subjects: Fifty-two (52) healthy human volunteers.Intervention: Subjects received placebo or AdoMet (800 mg per day) for 4 weeks. Hcy levels were measured before and after administration of AdoMet or placebo.Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was change in Hcy level. Secondary outcome measures included an interim Hcy determination (at 2 weeks) and changes in levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), lipids, and alanine aminotransferase.Results: There was no statistically significant change in Hcy between groups. Similarly, no statistically significant differences in change in Hcy or hsCRP levels were observed at 2 or 4 weeks. There was a small but statistically significant increase (p < 0.04) in alanine aminotransferase at week 2 and a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.04) in total cholesterol in the AdoMet group compared with the placebo group.Conclusions: AdoMet at a daily dose of 800 mg for 4 weeks does not appear to significantly affect Hcy levels in the blood."
"AbstractObjectives: The objective of the present study was to investigate whether moderately experienced meditators activate hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during silent mantra meditation, as has been observed in earlier studies on subjects with several years of practice.Methods: Subjects with less than 2 years of meditation practice according to the Kundalini yoga or Acem tradition were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging during silent mantra meditation, using an on–off block design. Whole-brain as well as region-of-interest analyses were performed.Results: The most significant activation was found in the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampal formations. Other areas with significant activation were the bilateral middle cingulate cortex and the bilateral precentral cortex. No activation in the anterior cingulate cortex was found, and only small activation clusters were observed in the prefrontal cortex.Conclusions: In conclusion, the main finding in this study was the significant activation in the hippocampi, which also has been correlated with meditation in several previous studies on very experienced meditators. We propose that the hippocampus is activated already after moderate meditation practice and also during different modes of meditation, including relaxation. The role of hippocampal activity during meditation should be further clarified in future studies, especially by investigating whether the meditation-correlated hippocampal activity is related to memory consolidation."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to describe possible changes in physical and psychologic symptoms among outpatients completing a 12-week mind–body medical symptom reduction program related to chronic medical conditions.Design: The cornerstone of the program is elicitation of the relaxation response, and the curriculum also incorporates trainings on mind–body interactions, cognitive restructuring, nutrition, and physical activity. The Medical Symptom Checklist (MSCL), Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II (HPLP-II) and Symptom Checklist-90R (SCL-90-R) were used to assess 331 patients' physical and psychologic symptoms before and after the intervention.Results: Significant post-treatment improvements in symptom frequency occurred for 12 individual symptoms on the MSCL, all 6 of the HPLP-II subscales, and 8 of the 9 SCL-90-R subscales from pre- to post-treatment.Conclusions: The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that a comprehensive mind–body intervention program might be useful as a complementary or adjunct therapy for treatment of chronic medical symptoms."
"AbstractObjectives: To classify people’s motives for seeking care from complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Participants were asked about a wide variety of motives representing all eight motivational states described in Reversal Theory (RT): telic, paratelic, conformist, negativist, mastery, sympathy, autic, and alloic.Design: Data from a convenience sample of 256 participants was examined using factorial techniques.Results: Six factors were evidenced that were easily interpretable in the RT framework. Participants perceived their motives largely in terms of goals and means, and within this domain they focused more on the goals (i.e., telic motives were more important than paratelic ones). Paratelic motives were, however, not unimportant: they ranked third. Participants also perceived their motives in terms of rules and constraints, and within this domain they focused more on rules (i.e., conformist motives were more important than negativist ones). Participants, finally, perceived their motives in terms of the combined domains of relationships and exchanges with others, namely, acting out of concern for others (alloic sympathy) as well as for themselves (autic mastery).Conclusions: If the six-factor structure is proved applicable, the six corresponding subscales could be used for systematically comparing motives among different types of patients, regarding different types of therapies, and among patients from different cultures."
"AbstractObjective: To review and summarize the methodological challenges in clinical trials of bodywork or handson mind–body therapies such as Feldenkraïs Method, Alexander Technique, Trager Work, Eutony, Body Awareness Therapy, Breath Therapy, and Rolfing, and to discuss ways these challenges can be addressed.Design: Review and commentary.Methods: Search of databases PubMed and EMBASE and screening of bibliographies. Published clinical studies were included if they used individual hands-on approaches and a focus on body awareness, and were not based on technical devices.Results: Of the 53 studies identified, 20 fulfilled inclusion criteria. No studies blinded subject to the treatment being given, but 5 used an alternative treatment and blinded participants to differential investigator expectations of efficacy. No study used a credible placebo intervention. No studies reported measures of patient expectations. Patient expectations have been measured in studies of other modalities but not of hands-on mind–body therapies. Options are presented for minimizing investigator and therapist bias and bias from differential patient expectations, and for maintaining some control for nonspecific treatment effects. Practical issues with recruitment and attrition resulting from volunteer bias are addressed.Conclusions: Rigorous clinical trials of hands-on complementary and alternative therapy interventions are scarce, needed, and feasible. Difficulties with blinding, placebo, and recruitment can be systematically addressed by various methods that minimize the respective biases. The methods suggested here may enhance the rigor of further explanatory trials."
"AbstractObjectives: To investigate the efficacy of an herbal formula in the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission among health care workers. The secondary objectives are to investigate quality of life (QOL) and symptomology changes among supplement users, and to evaluate the safety of this formula.Design: Controlled clinical trial.Settings: Hong Kong during epidemic of SARS.Subjects: Two cohorts of health care workers from 11 hospitals in Hong Kong, 1 using an herbal supplement for a 2-week period (n = 1063) and a control cohort comprising all other health care workers who did not receive the supplement (n = 36,111) were compared prospectively.Interventions: Taking an herbal supplement for a 2-week period.Outcome measures: SARS attack rates and changes in quality of life and influenza-like symptoms were also examined at three timepoints among herbal supplement users.Results: None of the health care workers who used the supplement subsequently contracted SARS compared to 0.4% of the health care workers who did not use the supplement (p = 0.014). Improvements in influenzalike symptoms and quality of life measurements were also observed among herbal supplement users. Less than 2% reported minor adverse events.Conclusion: The results of this pilot study suggest that there is a good potential of using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) supplements to prevent the spread of SARS."
"AbstractObjective: To show the effects of short wave diathermy (SWD) added on prolotherapy injections in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee on pain, physical functioning, and quality of life.Design: This is a single-blinded randomized controlled study.Setting: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of a university hospital.Subjects: Sixty-three patients with OA of the knee with Kellgren–Lawrence class 2 or 3 were included in the study.Methods: Patients were randomized into two groups, first being dextrose prolotherapy+SWD and the second being dextrose prolotherapy with sham SWD. Patients were injected with dextrose prolotherapy solutions in the beginning, third, and sixth week of the study, for a total of three times, and took 20 min of SWD after injection (true or sham).Outcome measures: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were applied before, after (sixth week), and at the third month of treatment.Results: Both groups showed improvements in VAS, WOMAC, and SF-36 scores (p < 0.05). Between-group analyses showed no significant differences (p > 0.05).Conclusions: This study shows that prolotherapy is effective for pain, functionality, and quality of life in patients with OA of the knee. The effects of additional SWD require more evidence. More studies of higher quality are required to make a statement."
"AbstractBackground: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic cause. Despite its prevalence, there remains a significant lack of efficient medical treatment for IBS to date. However, according to some previous research studies, hypnosis has been shown to be effective in the treatment of IBS.Aim: To determine the definite efficacy of hypnosis in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.Methods: A systematic review of the literature on hypnosis in the treatment of IBS from 1970 to 2005 was performed using MEDLINE®. Full studies published in English were identified and selected for inclusion. We excluded case studies and those studies in which IBS symptoms were not in the list of outcome measures. All studies were reviewed on the basis of the Rome Working Team recommendations for design of IBS trials.Results: From a total of 22 studies, seven were excluded. The results of the reviewed studies showed improved status of all major symptoms of IBS, extracolonic symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore these improvements lasted 2–5 years.Conclusions: Although there are some methodologic inadequacies, all studies show that hypnotherapy is highly effective for patients with refractory IBS, but definite efficacy of hypnosis in the treatment of IBS remains unclear due to lack of controlled trials supporting this finding."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of the study was to develop a whole medical system healthcare program as an alternative for group-oriented guidelines and as a basis for future studies on safety and (cost) effects. Mild to moderately severe depressive disorders were chosen as an illustrative example.Design: Literature surveys, monodisciplinary expert interviews, and multidisciplinary panel discussions were employed to describe the whole medical system, its important elements, and the way the important elements are integrated in daily practice.Results: The treatment of depressive disorders consists of four separate treatment phases in which 10 specific treatment goals are identified. Different disciplines may contribute to each goal. This gives an opportunity for the individualization of care. Within each discipline multiple options per goal are identified which leads to additional possibilities to individualize care.Conclusions: Individualized healthcare for patients with mild to moderately severe depressive disorders can be described in terms of treatment goals and treatment options to allow for personalization. The program may serve as the basis for future measurement of quality, cost effectiveness, and safety of provided care."
"AbstractObjective: The objective of this study was to investigate efficacy of a whole-body vibration (WBV) intervention on functional performance of community-dwelling older adults.Design: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial.Setting: The setting was in community centers.Subjects: There were 37 total subjects (21 women and 16 men) (age 69 ± 8 years; mean ± standard deviation).Intervention: Participants were randomized to a WBV intervention (INT) group and control (CON) group. Whole-body vibration was administered for five 1-minute bouts per session, 3 days per week, for 6 weeks. The CON group was asked not to commence any form of physical training.Outcome measures: Functional performance was measured with the timed-up-and-go-test (TUG) and sit-to-stand-test (STS).Results: After WBV, TUG and STS time was less for INT than CON (INT, TUG 7.6 ± 0.3 seconds, STS 11.9 ± 2.0 seconds; CON, TUG 8.6 ± 0.9, STS 13.5 ± 1.1 seconds; p < 0.05). Within INT, TUG improved 0.9 ± 0.4 seconds; p = 0.01 and STS improved 3.0 ± 0.9 seconds; p = 0.05).Conclusions: The efficacy of this WBV intervention was established. Functional performance improvement after WBV may be attributed to a number of biological mechanisms that remain speculative. Further research is required to mechanistically understand the effects of WBV on older adults."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the extent of health insurance coverage for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) within one region in the United States, a study prompted          by the increased utilization of CAM.Design: Prospective telephone interview of health insurance representatives.Location: A contiguous three-state area (New York, New Jersey, and          Connecticut) in the Northeast.Results: Almost all of the insurers surveyed cover chiropractic services. Less than half of the insurers reimburse acupuncture, usually for chronic pain management.          Coverage for massage therapy is minimal and usually associated with physical therapy or chiropractic treatment. Other CAM services receive negligible coverage.Conclusions: Current health insurance          coverage of CAM is limited essentially to chiropractic medicine, acupuncture and massage therapy. Coverage of CAM is made confusing by different policies, practitioner requirements, and health plans within          each carrier.      "
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of massage on nausea, anxiety, and depression in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.Design: This work was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.Settings/location: This study was conducted in an oncology clinic, in a hospital in southwestern Sweden.Subjects: Thirty-nine (39) women (mean age = 51.8) with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were enrolled.Interventions: The patients were randomly assigned to a massage therapy group (20 minutes of massage on five occasions) or a control group (five 20-minute visits).Outcome measures: All patients recorded nausea and anxiety on the Visual Analogue Scale before and after each intervention. They also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Results: Massage treatment significantly reduced nausea compared with control treatment (p = 0.025) when improvement was measured as a percentage of the five treatment periods. Differences in anxiety and depression between the two treatment regimes could not be statistically demonstrated.Conclusions: This study complements previous studies on the effect of massage and supports the conclusion that massage reduces nausea in these patients."
"AbstractObjective: The purpose of this trial was to study the effects of chronic resveratrol use on cognitive function in humans.Design: The authors conducted a double-blind, Phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled trial to obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of resveratrol supplementation on cognitive function over a 90-day period in older adults.Location: University of Florida in Gainesville, FL.Subjects: Sedentary, overweight older adults (N = 32; age range: 65–93 years, M age = 73.34 years, SD age = 7.02 years).Intervention: Participants were randomized to one of three treatment groups (placebo, 300 mg/day resveratrol, 1000 mg/day resveratrol) for 90 days.Outcome measures: Cognitive function was assessed before and after treatment using a well-characterized test battery: Trail Making, Digits Forward and Backward, Erikson-Flanker, Controlled Oral Word Association, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, and Task Switching.Results: Psychomotor speed improved on the Trail Making Test part A in participants taking 1000 mg/day of resveratrol compared with participants in both the 300 mg/day condition and the placebo condition (p = 0.02).Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that 90 days of resveratrol supplementation at a dose of 1000/mg per day selectively improves psychomotor speed but does not significantly affect other domains of cognitive function in older adults. These findings provide modest support to further study the effects of resveratrol on cognitive function in older adults."
"AbstractObjective: This study examined the effects of a comprehensive mind–body program on sense of nondual awareness and spiritual awakening.Design and Intervention: The study compared the effects of participation in an intensive 6-day Ayurveda-based mind–body program that addressed physical, emotional, and spiritual domains as compared with a control condition.Setting: Resort setting.Subjects: Participants were 69 healthy women and men (mean age 53.9 years; range 32–86).Outcome measure: The primary outcome was the Nondual Embodiment Thematic Inventory (NETI).Results: A significant group by time interaction (p = 0.029) indicated that after the intervention, participants in the mind–body program showed a significant increase in NETI scores (p < 0.03), which was sustained 1 month later (p < 0.01).Conclusion: Findings suggest that an intensive program providing holistic instruction and experience in mind–body practices can lead to a significant and sustained shift in perception of self-awareness, one that is likely favorable to well-being."
"AbstractObjective: To determine the relationship between the use of rubbing ointments and asthma morbidity in adolescents.Design: Cross-sectional study.Settings/Location: Inner-city high school in the Bronx, New York.Subjects: 165 adolescents with asthma.Outcome measures: Asthma morbidity, defined as emergency department (ED) use for asthma in the past year and over the lifetime.Results: While 127 (77%) of subjects used albuterol as the first treatment for their last asthma attack, 18 (11%) used rubbing ointments. The rubs and albuterol groups were similar in asthma severity, mean age, gender, and ethnicity. However, subjects in the the rubs group were less likely than subjects in the albuterol group to have made an ED visit over the past 12 months or over their lifetime. Regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for asthma severity, use of rubs independently predicted less lifetime ED use.Conclusions: After controlling for asthma severity, use of rubs by adolescents with asthma was associated with lower asthma morbidity as measured by ED use."
"AbstractObjectives: (1) To demonstrate information entanglement between separated sites of a single experimental system over distances of 1500-2000 miles and (2) to provide experimental ΔpH(t)-data,          above the theoretical value for conditioned spaces, over a long time period for these various sites.Design: The same as Part I of this series but with two additional control sites, 1500-2000          miles distant from any intention imprinted electrical device (IIED) site.Setting/location: The same as Part I but scientific laboratories for the two additional control sites.Subjects:          Three IIED sites plus five control sites.Interventions: None.Results: ΔpH(t)-data variations with time, over a long time duration, for all sites.Conclusions: Major          information entanglement exists between IIED sites and non-IIED sites, even at separation distances in excess of 2000 miles.

"AbstractObjectives: To study the effect of single-needle acupuncture in suppressing gag-reflex in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).Design: Prospective, blinded trial.Settings/locations:          Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack undergoing TEE because of presumed cardioembolic origin in a specialized stroke unit of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main,          Germany.Subjects/Study interventions: Forty-one (41) patients were studied. Patients received single-needle acupuncture with a 0.2 × 13 mm disposable acupuncture needle (Suzhou Medical          Appliances, China), 10-mm deep either at Chengjiang (midline between lower lip and chin) or superficially at a sham point (tip of the chin) during TEE or no acupuncture for alleviating gag reflex.Outcome          Measures: Severity of gagging was rated on a visual-analogue scale.Results: The acupuncture group experienced significantly less gagging than the sham group (p = 0.037) or the nonacupuncture          group (p = 0.013).Conclusions: Acupuncture of CV24 is an easy to apply and effective method to reduce gag reflex during TEE.

"AbstractObjectives: The study objective was to estimate complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among active duty military and compare data with civilian use.Design: A global survey on CAM use in the 12 previous months was conducted. Final participants (16,146) were stratified by gender, service, region, and pay grade. Analysis included prevalence of CAM use, demographic and lifestyle characteristics.Results: Approximately 45% of respondents reported using at least one type of CAM therapy. Most commonly used therapies were as follows: prayer for one's own health (24.4%), massage therapy (14.1%), and relaxation techniques (10.8%). After exclusion of prayer for one's own health, adjusting to the 2000 U.S. census, overall CAM use in the military (44.5%) was higher than that in comparable civilian surveys (36.0% and 38.3%).Conclusions: Military personnel reported using three CAM stress-reduction therapies at 2.5–7 times the rate of civilians. Among the military, high utilization of CAM practices that reduce stress may serve as markers for practitioners assessing an individual's health and well-being."
"AbstractObjective: A need exists to understand illness attribution and treatment beliefs among those seeking botanical treatment for anxiety. The objectives of this study are to evaluate explanatory beliefs about reasons for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and to evaluate the extent  to which subjects thought different approaches might be most helpful, in a study of botanical treatment. Design: Post hoc analysis of data from two similarly randomized controlled clinical trails. Setting: Psychiatric research clinic in an academic medical center. Subjects: Fifty-one (51) outpatients participating in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of kava in GAD. Interventions: Kava and placebo. Main outcome measures: Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Global Improvement Scale. Results: Subjects  thought their conditions were largely related to personality factors, stressful life experiences, or cognitive patterns. These beliefs correlated positively with treatment response, whereas endorsement of belief in an energy imbalance or biologic abnormality correlated negatively with improvement. Conclusion: Subjects felt more strongly that cognitive patterns, personality and stress were causative of their GAD and of greatest relevance to recovery. Biologic/genetic factors were somewhat relevant, whereas the importance of energy imbalance and spiritual/religious factors were minimal.  When treating patients, it is important to consider the patient's belief systems regarding the disorder, as well as credibility of treatment."
"AbstractObjectives: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an echinacea compound herbal tea preparation (Echinacea Plus®) given at early onset of cold or flu symptoms in a          random assignment double-blind placebo-controlled study.Design and Subjects: A total of 95 subjects with early symptoms of cold or flu (runny nose, scratchy throat, fever) were randomly assigned          to receive Echinacea Plus tea five to six cups per day titrating to 1 over 5 days or placebo in a double-blind situation. Each participant completed a questionnaire 14 days after beginning the program.          The efficacy, number of days the symptoms lasted, and number of days for change were measured with a self scoring questionnaire.Results: The study period was 90 days (January 1, 1999 to March          30, 1999). There was a significant difference between the experimental group (Echinacea Plus) and control group (placebo) for all 3 questions measured: p < 0.001. There were no negative effects reported          by any of the subjects in either group.Conclusions: Treatment with Echinacea Plus® tea at early onset of cold or flu symptoms was effective for relieving these symptoms in a shorter          period of time than a placebo.
